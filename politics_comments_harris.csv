1,"Ah i see the ""freedom of speech is essential"" crowd have gotten mad at someone for using their free speech. What a surprise. Good on clark for standing on her values and not backing down"
2,"I admire Swift (and Clark) saying basically ""don't do it because I did it, EDUCATE YOURSELF and make your own decision"".

It's classy. It's proper. And maybe it gets some young people thinking for the first time about how politics affects their lives."
3,And a lot of conservative RW’ers heads explode in the Midwest since a lot of them stereotyped her into being conservative. Glad Caitlin set them straight
4,[deleted]
5,People whining and unfollowing her for doing this just shows they never really cared about the basketball in the first place.

7,">“So, I think the biggest thing would be just encourage people to register to vote. I think for myself, the second time I can vote in an election at age 22, I could vote when I was 18,” she said. “So, I think, do that. That’s the biggest thing I can do with the platform that I have, and that’s the same thing Taylor did.”

>In a message to her more than 280 million Instagram followers, Swift encouraged her followers to do their “research” and reminded them to register to vote ahead of the November election.

>Clark shared a similar message, urging voters to “educate” themselves on this year’s nominees.

>“Continue to educate yourself on the candidates that we have, the policies that they’re supporting — I think that’s the biggest thing you can do,” she said. “And that’s what I would recommend to every single person that has the opportunity in our country.”

I'm so tired of people acting like one of the candidates isn't an openly anti-American sex criminal with dementia. 

Like sure, any other time, educate yourself. This election is only about ""do you want to keep basic American freedom, yes or no?"""
8,MAGA heads exploding because many of them have been holding out Caitlin Clark as a victim of so-called “reverse discrimination” and here she is being all liberal and not one of them.
9,Can sexist Republicans boycott something they never watched?
10,"Jfc, the world's on fire, ENDORSE THE FIREWOMAN for the love of God. 

Vote Harris/Walz!"
11,MAGAs hate the message of ‘educate yourself’ even more than an outright endorsement of Kamala Harris. If they educate themselves there’s no chance they’re voting for Trump.
12,"Oh no, my conservative step dad that watches her WNBA games in his underwear will be devastated."
13,"And don't let them gaslight you with the ""stick to sports"" bullshit.

Donald Trump was a tabloid celebrity and game show host and they handed their entire political party and ideology over to him to use as his personal plaything."
14,"Wait. Is this the Harris endorsement? The conservatives are so angry about? 

She didn't even do it. She just told people to vote. Holy shit."
15,"Swift never told anyone who THEY need to to vote for, only that they need to vote along with a reminder to register and early vote if that is an option.

Clark is similarly not telling anyone WHO to vote for. 

Scott Baio, Kevin Sorbo, Roseanne Barr on the other hand..."
16,Only problem is some people think educating themselves means listen to whatever they already want to hear and do some research on tik tok or instagram though. Then there’s some who think they’ve already educated themselves from said tik toks
17,"""Y-you're supposed to be OUR white hope!"" - GOP, probably"
18,"Conservatives: Do your own research - wait, no, not like that. Stop!"
19,Clark didn't endorse Kamala. Didn't come out in support of Swift. Just liked a picture on Instagram. These chuds are some real snowflakes lol.
20,"“I did, that’s why I’m voting for the Felon!!”

-that cult"
21,I'm gonna put this very clearly to people. Swift didn't even tell people to vote for harris. She said what SHE was doing and directed people to register. That's it. She didn't say 'register and vote for harris'.
22,Iowan MAGATs are melting down here over this and it’s so delicious to watch.
23,"[Trump quote:](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-love-poorly-educated/)""I love the poorly educated!""

An informed electorate, rather than ones who vote their fears, prejudices, insecurities and hatreds, is essential for a functioning Democracy.  Newsmax doesn't count as information."
24,Did someone think that a college educated woman playing in a sport with all kinds of different races would maybe support Trump? Who has a problem with her liking this?
25,"Every time Caitlyn Clark has a statement that I see, it just reinforces how much of a class act she is. She's been on the receiving end of some brutal treatment in the WNBA and shrugs it all off with real strength and dignity."
26,"""I never liked her, players just need to shut up and dribble"" - Average MAGA supporter who probably owns a Harrison Butker jersey."
27,"Incoming Laura Ingraham special snowflake report, telling yet another star basketball athlete to ""shut up and dribble"". "
28,"It says a lot about you when you’re pissed at someone for telling folks to educate themselves about the candidates. 

The message we’re getting is that you don’t want people to know your politics because they’re so evil and harmful."
29,its almost like Black women have been saying for months that her fanbase is comprised of racist maga people
30,"Remember, encouraging more people to vote is a liberal conspiracy.

If we had 100% voter turnout in this country, there would never be any more Republican presidents.

And people say, why should we encourage uninformed people to vote? As though the people who vote religiously, literally, are any more ""informed""?"
31,"What she actually said is a mature and level headed thing that everyone should agree with, so of course right-wingers will be outraged by it."
32,Apparently everyone on the right just assumed she was MAGA because she was born in Iowa or something
33,Conservatives 100% probably think she's transgender
34,The cross section of WNBA watchers and Trump supporters is non existent. All Trump supporters do is complain about the WNBA(and NBA).
35,Sheryl Swoopes is going to vote Trump now
36,"I love me some Caitlin Clark, on and off court."
37,"Oh no, not the right's new favorite trophy celebrity!!"
38,"""Just because I'm in a complete shit hole state full of religious zealots and bigots doesn't mean I'm one too""

The religious zealots and bigots in Indiana: >:O"
39,If Taylor's endorsement of a candidate actually triggers people to educate themselves about political candidates and vote their hearts: amazing!
40,Shes very smart. This isnt surprising one bit
41, MAGA: “Please don’t”
42,"Trump (probably): “ I never liked her. She never had any skills. I mean come on, WNBA. That’s for losers. Real basketball players play for the NBA.”"
43,"Telling people to vote is not an endorsement of Harris unless you go by the Republican playbook (looking at you Paxton and Abbott) of working diligently to keep people from voting.

My God, can you imagine how they would be reacting if Swift had come out for Trump. It would be total headline news shore to shore. ""Oh she is so popular right now and so influential that terrorists targeted her concert like the did former president trump!!!. If you are not in line with TayTay then you are just not it."" They would be over the moon and jacking her up as the political endorsement of the ages."
44,Edify me baby!
45,"I'm not sure how well that will play out in Indiana. But what do I know

 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
46,"It's interesting to see athletes like Caitlin Clark speaking up about politics. Athletes, just like everyone else, have personal beliefs, and it’s cool when they feel empowered to share them. Whether people agree or disagree, it’s important to approach these conversations with an open mind and respect for different opinions."
47,"Don't have a horse in this race, but she didn't endorse either candidate. She just liked a post and when asked, pointed to the do your research bit. For all we know, she liked that part."
48,"I'm no fan of Republican politics, but this ain't that. This is an open bid for fascism and openly rejecting that bid is important. I'd like to imagine a future where we move past all of this, so making this distinction and choosing now and only now up speak up is the right move for people that don't usually get involved in politics."
49,"I could have wished CC was more directly supportive of Harris/Walz, but I'll take it. This is Indy fn Ana."
50,"To my conservative extended family, educating yourself means going to www.1776VoteTrump1488.ru so I prefer giving credible resources. But I’m just nitpicking."
51,I love looking through the other people who liked her post and seeing which of my friends are there. Some have surprised me!
52,I just love how she makes the racists like Reese so mad. 
53,"To me this pulls up disappointingly short of anything substantial or concrete. She clearly has a belief here but acknowledging you have a massive platform, then using it for such a milquetoast message, feels contrived. 

I realize she’s young and her earning potential comes primarily from endorsements, not salary, but I don’t feel she’d be risking a ton to make a tacit endorsement. 

Nor do I feel her endorsement would flip Iowa, but she’s beloved there and the state voted for Obama twice. Even if you don’t flip many votes it’s important that to give her reasonable conservative fans something concrete to consider. So many have this caricature of liberals in their mind and Caitlyn Clark would pierce that."
54,This article seems to assume we know who Caitlin Clark is.
55,I’m GOD… it’s not looking good for any of you
56,I will do whatever swift and Caitlin say to do because I am a free thinker.
57,Pray she didn’t mean educate-yourself.org. Creepy conspiracy website.
58,And if she supported trump in any way there would be a campaign to ruin her reputation very slowly but surely by the people of Reddit and the media. If I was a celebrity and liked trump I would not say anything because it’s basically career suicide. Better off just saying you like Kamala if you had to pick because at least the other political party won’t try to ruin your life
59,Apparently she hasn’t
60,Who cares two self-righteous blowhards pretending they know what's best for everyone. Stick to groveling for sponsors
61,"That's where Americans get their political opinions: Celebrity news and what they said. I can't believe that the US is still a country with a population this thick. It would be fucking nice if you'd shut the fuck up for a while tho. Your stupidity is physically painful to people from other nations. 

This isn't politics, this is yellow press. I'd tell you to learn the difference, but I don't think you are capable."
62,I've witnessed it.  I'm educated.   NO ON COMMIE HARRIS/WALZ.
63,[deleted]
64,"The forecast for today is a lot of ""Shut up and dribble"" comments with a bit of ""Get back in the kitchen"""
65,"I watch a lot of WNBA and it’s been funny seeing the racist crowd latch onto Caitlyn Clark as a symbol of white superiority. They thought she was one of them the whole time, which is so stupid because she plays a sport with predominantly black people. I waiting for something like this to happen. I Imagine they will turn on her now."
66,"""Freedom of speech was never intended to be used by women to disagree with me!"""
67,"R con was like ""why does a celebrity matter what's wrong with these leftists"" and I'm like ""your guy is known for firing people and being orange. Come on.'"
68,"Unless it’s Hulk Hogan, Kid Rock or Kevin Sorbo, celebs need to keep their mouths shut I guess."
69,"The party of ""freedom for me, but not for thee"". What else do you expect."
70,"Freedom to a conservative means one thing - *their* freedom to be bigots. They should be allowed to use the N word without losing their job, *you* may not dress the way you want. "
71,It’s only free speech if its the right speech. All other speech is wrong and should be censored.
72,"I want to add that everybody who has a Trump flag, sign, clothing item, etc. are using their free speech to advocate and they worship a billionaire. 


This makes it very clear they are simply mad that the person isn't advocating for Trump and their excuses are lies. "
73,Mark Hamill posts about leftist politics a lot and the comments section is FULL of TONS of MAGA telling him not to post about politics. It's like...what happened to that freedom of speech you always whine about?
74,"The ""freedom of speech"" crowd voting for trump, who literally just said in Fox that he wants to strip news licenses from people that criticize him.

Yup, sounds like freedom of speech to me.

/s"
75,"Exactly, it's not the Super Bowl, young America. It's the battle for who gets to pass and enforce their legislative priorities, i.e. the laws that bind us."
76,[deleted]
77,"And the added bonus of educating yourself is to not vote R, ever."
78,"It’s the way to go, but that phrase, did my research or do your own research is just now completely lost all credibility after Qanon. That was their motto. It is prima facie clear in this case who is a rancid human being and who is an adult and I’m ok with people saying it"
79,"She's right. Players have a platform and have every right to use it. When it comes to something this important, if you feel strongly about it, you might as well use it."
80,Classy? Proper? That’s nothing that the new right stands for.
81,"I applaud the way she did this.

1) She addressed a meme alleging she endorsed Trump, correcting it and stating her actual voting preference

2 She encouraged voters first and foremost to vote *at all* and to do so not based on her stance, but on their own research and values."
82,"It's very good, I would love for them to follow up with also a little on HOW to educate yourself. New voters and undecideds can feel very overwhelmed and lost and get hung up on rhetoric and mudslinging, only.

Just something very simple like ""search for a simple list of candidates stances on different topics to start"" and then if they choose to link to a neutral site with high rated fact checking like [procon.org](https://2024election.procon.org/side-by-side-comparison-chart/)

If they really want to use their platform, leading people to unbiased places in the maze of disinformation we have today would be a crucial step."
83,"I guess it’s all in how you read it. I took it as “*Educate* yourself,” whereas the less confrontational way is “Educate your*self*.”"
84,"When it comes to American politics, ""EDUCATE YOURSELF"" is an invitation to explore a vast ocean of information and misinformation.

Young people need a good starting point.  

Something like: Only one side is telling people they shouldn't vote, strategically removing people from voter registrations, and passing laws to try and make it harder to vote. 

Figuring out which side is doing it and why will likely give you enough information to make a good decision."
85,"MAGA and Right Wing media are still losing their shit. ""How *dare you* suggest people educate themselves and engage civically! That's *disgusting!* Your an entertainer, stay in your lane!"".

No, that's American. That's democratic. Also, fuck off, megyn kelly."
86,Do you really have to educate yourself though? There’s obviously one correct candidate and it only takes five seconds to figure that out
87,"Educating myself by going on twitter: Immigrants are eating cats? Many people are saying it, must be true."
88,"As much as I want to believe it, I doubt that’s what’s going to end up happening.

As a society, we worship the opinion of the rich and successful .001% far too much to ever figure out how to collectively think for ourselves and in our own interests. 

As a collective, we’re going to forever be cringe for giving this much of a damn about what Taylor Swift thinks as much it is to also give a shit about Hulk Hogan or Kid Rock."
89,"If they actually educate themselves you guys might be upset with how
decide to vote."
90,I educated myself into knowing Kamala Harris is a genocider.
91,Lmao they stereotyped a WNBA star as conservative??
92,"hell, she might have been a conservative if the GOP wasn't actively trying to harm women."
93,"She's an educated woman, the chances of her being conservative are increasingly slim. But a woman who grew up in Iowa, went to college there and now plays in Indiana being openly supportive of Kamala is still something that will surprise people.

Hopefully she can encourage other young women in those states to be more open about their political views."
94,"They thought she was their white conservative savior. Turns out, playing with gay and black people doesn't work well with that mindset."
95,"She’s a female athlete, and they’ve convinced themselves that their transphobia is actually “protecting women’s sports” so they probably expect most female athletes to support them. "
96,Well she was/is Catholic and was almost going to Notre Dame. It isn’t a stretch to assume that she would be conservative. But boy am I glad she’s not!
97,I miss the days when Indiana farmers were basically libertarians that wanted government to leave people alone instead of trying to force their rural christian values on everyone else. 
98,"

Indiana has terrible voter turnout rates and some of the most restrictive voting laws in the country. If she can get more people in this god-forsaken state to simply show up, that would be the biggest political revolution in this state since Obama won the state in 2008.



Also for Indiana specifically because: [https://vote.gov/register/indiana](https://vote.gov/register/indiana)"
99,The dominoes are starting to fall.
100,They surely didn't watch the WNBA before she showed up.
101,"  
Not just that, how many conservatives immediately fall on the sword and say theyre being cancelled for their political beliefs?

She has the balls to take it head on."
102,"If women turn out for this election more than men, especially in swing states, the election won't be close."
103,"As a hwhite man, this. Tired of geriatric nutjobs ruling the country"
104,Women will be the ones to save our asses this election 
105,White boys and girls. There’s some white women who fall right in line with them who are in congress.
106,[deleted]
107,"if Nikki Haley was in Donald's place, the threat to minorities, to women, and to equal rights and the free ride of the wealthy remains exactly the same --- people need to stop making Trump the singled out bad person in the GOP. They're all terrible!"
108,"As a famous athlete once said ""Republicans buy shoes too."" None of these people will ever go so far as saying ""Trump is a vile monster who must be stopped"" because they want to keep their options of revenue open by not pissing off the GOP too much."
109,"You would be surprised how many young people are busy keeping body and soul together and have no time for ""doing the research."" Fifteen credit hours per semester, national guard weekends, two jobs, kids, student loan debt looming. Yeah, that's most non-elite college students."
110,"How very anti-democracy of you. 

>This election is only about ""do you want to keep basic American freedom, yes or no?""

Completely subjective, leaving zero tolerance for diversity of thought."
111,"It doesn’t mean she’s not a victim of reverse discrimation though, right?"
112,I can’t believe that’s the first time I’ve seen it framed exactly like that but it’s great. Thanks!
113,"They don't even get that far, they just see red at the implication that their views are backwards and uneducated.

Which, they are. But it *really* pisses them off to be told it directly."
114,"Heard an interview with a DeSantis staffer. During the portion where they were talking about republican campaign strategy, he mentioned specifically targeting uneducated women. It was said so smoothly in his description of strategies, like so matter of fact. Like I knew this was part of it, but to hear it coming from a professional was alarming."
115,"Honestly telling them to educate themselves is akin to telling someone that's drowning to just swim.  They literally don't know how, and when you tell a conservative to do something they don't know how to do, it's always toddler rage in return.


They are offended by being told to better themselves."
116,"What I find funny is ""educate yourself"" isn't really that far from ""I did my research"".  It's the same empty platitude that doesn't actually say anything.  I can't imagine why it upsets them so much when ""I've done my research"" was their catchphrase for a decade."
117,Yo wtf that is creepy as hell
118,"To conservatives, encouraging people to vote is synonymous with an endorsement of the Democratic candidate.

Higher turnout is typically an advantage for Democrats. It’s why Republicans work so hard to make voting harder, being against mail in, requiring a drivers license, shutting down polling stations, etc."
119,Republicans hate democracy.
120,"I recall another celebrity (think it was Ariana Grande?) who also only encouraged people to vote but never named a candidate, and it made the conservatives very mad. They know exactly what kind of people listen to these particular celebrities, and it makes them mad."
121,"Well she ""liked"" Swift's post which endorsed Harris so they are assuming that she's also implicitly endorsing Harris, though she didn't say that explicitly."
122,"I mean at least Trump has major celebrities back him...oh wait...

At least their B level celebrities...oh wait...

Is there like a Y or Z level celebrity?"
123,"Blue Iowan here, I'm enjoying the salty maga tears"
124,Nope just fine actually. Watching two white women humiliate themselves for attention from crowds that hate them is hilarious actually. Peak Darwinism
125,I know quite a few republican men that watch the WNBA because of Caitlin Clark. It got really popular in the Midwest this year.
126,Actually my MAGA relatives watch the WNBA and they specifically have talked about how good Clark is. (I don’t watch basketball and would have no idea who she is if they hadn’t mentioned her a few times.)
127,"Honestly, not a lot of Harris supporters watch the WNBA either.

It's subsidized by the NBA, it could not survive on its own.

Just saying..."
128,Diana Taurasi buying a MAGA hat as we speak.
129,"You consume different media than others and that's okay.

I went to Iowa so she's very relevant to me, but again you didn't go to Iowa, and so she's not to you.

She's fucking amazing at basketball and it's her first professional year. So much for her still to do.

Now that you know, you have a chance to see her play tonight against the tough as nail, LV Aces! Enjoy, the WNBA is fantastic thing to watch right now."
130,"They both suggested that you do your own research, so…"
131,I will do whatever Ted Nugent and Kid Rock say to do because I am a free thinker.
132,"They both said ""educate yourselves"" not ""vote for who I'm voting for"""
133,Nothing wrong with being a sheep. Live care free lives for the most part. You ever seen a sheep get high on meth or beat their wife?
134,Don't waste time on this one just report it.
135,You're whining about self-righteous blowhards when one of the candidates is Donald Trump? Really?
136,"When you claim to be educated and the only thing you can do is scream a lie, all you are doing is telling people that it is pointless to waste time talking with you."
137,Lol claims to be educated but doesn't know what communism is.
138,"There's no such thing as ""Commie Harris"", so scream about voting ""no"" to it all you want.

No to the Easter Bunny!
No to Freddy Krueger!"
139,"Educate yourself

https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/communism"
140,"I've witnessed it. I'm educated.

Do the research into the policies that the candidates stand for.

I for one do not embrace Project 2025 or any of its tenants in any shape or form... I actually find it appalling and a slippery slope into Christo-fascism.

Vote for how your conscience dictates."
141,"Any government regulation is communism, that’s what my dad and my pastor told me 🥴"
142,"Someone in your life failed you along the way. You aren’t a critical thinker, you’re driven by boogeymen, and you lack fundamental understandings of political ideologies like communism."
143,You're not educated if you think either one is a communist.
144,"Clearly your claim is false, since they are not ""commie"" in any way, shape or form."
145,"Not knowing what the word ""communism"" means really doesn't give anyone the impression that you're educated."
146,Have you guys ever noticed that the popular communist movement in the US has been dead for seventy years and actual communists fucking despise Democrats?
147,Support is something that does something for someone.  A bunch of people arguing on the internet is not support.
148,"You think half of all WNBA fans are Trump supporters?

Where are you getting those numbers?"
149,"And just like that, she tripled her support."
150,"It is interesting, because in her statement she echoed a lot of what Taylor Swift said. She said that it is important to educate yourself on the candidates and choose the one that you think is best for yourself in the country, and she stressed the importance of registering and voting. 


Unless there was more that the article didn't mention, she didn't name a party or a candidate, although you can pretty clearly infer that she supports Harris over Trump based on context. But, in the actual statement, there isn't anything in there that should be controversial. And it is unfortunate and telling that it is controversial to a certain subset of the population."
151,Thing with her is she actually has something to offer the world. When Donnie is long gone and locked in a cell nobody will give a shit. I'd also be shocked at the ratio of Rumper support she has. Aside from the fact that shit pants and his freak show circus of surrogates are ghouls and any money generated by them is tainted.
152,"Yeah, just like Swift lost so much support supporting Biden last election… oh wait…"
153,"""maga moment"""
154,"Support she didn't need at all 🤷 go support Hulk Hogan, he really needs it nowadays"
155,"Itll be Ok, she will be fine. "
156,"And so what if that's true? It doesn't change her abilities, her talents. She's going to continue to play good basketball regardless of whether there are butt-hurt MAGAites who don't like what she's said."
157,"I doubt it. Like her politics or not, the WNBA is still beating her ass and calling no fouls."
158,"You’d think the “shut up and dribble” folks would short circuit when a woman dribbler is who they want to shut up, because they won’t know which to tell her to do."
159,With an off chance of Elon offering to impregnate her.
160,I just saw a “shut up and sing” and no one seems to understand the irony in that request lmao
161,"Maybe the people saying “shut up and dribble” should take their own advice, and shut up and do whatever thing it is that pays their own bills"
162,"Also some ""no one cares about the WNBA anyway!"""
163,"Those same people on Election Day: “Looks like we lost a lot of women voters to Kamala, typical women so predictable”"
164,So…. Wear a jacket? Sweater? Hood?
165,Any 'shut up and dribble' crowd must be too young to remember greats like Kareem.
166,"Along with ""Stay in your lane"" and ""Politics do belong at concerts and in sports"""
167,">  racist crowd latch onto Caitlyn Clark as a symbol of white superiority.

They did it with Taylor swift in the past too.

If you're an attractive, feminine, white woman, they assume you must be conservative. In their mind all liberal women are fat lesbians with purple hair."
168,"Not just because she plays in that sport. She is from Des Moines, played in Iowa City (probably the most blue town in Iowa), and is college educated. Pretty sure her boyfriend comes from a family of Democrats too. The odds are pretty stacked she tilts blue, even if she doesn't want to make it public for business reasons"
169,“And *definitely* not by the woman I’ve been using to push my racism for months!”
170,"Yeah plus Taylor Swift already won the Super Bowl, so she’s moved on."
171,Clarkies for Harris!!
172,Kid could go start for the Hornets right now and make an impact. Fucking legend.
173,Why vote R when you can vote D. They’re essentially the same parties of fascism anyway.
174,"This is what people who ""do their own research"" sound like:

FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:  Random claim


DAVID MUIR: I just want to clarify here...  no credible reports...

FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I've seen people on television

DAVID MUIR: Let me just say here this ...

FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The people on television say...

DAVID MUIR: I'm not taking this from television...

FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But the people on television say...

DAVID MUIR: Again...  there's no evidence of that.

FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We'll find out"
175,"Just like they don’t get to co-opt what it means to be an American, a Patriot or what Freedom means, we don’t have to let them redefine what it means to “do your own research” and make up your own mind. 

“Do your own research” has just been redefined by the wackos and racists to mean “Led by the nose with selective misinformation and disinformation spammed repeatedly to your inbox and plastering your SM feed by nefarious actors, irresponsible SM algorithms and useful idiots that reinforces your priors.”

We can change that too."
176,If research is done utilizing purely biased sources its not research and they missed the point.
177,"I'll admit my first immediate thought when I hear ""do your own research"" is that this person is a clueless ignorant conspiracy theorist. I don't know how to fix that."

What a shitty take *with no nuance*. Makes me think it's astroturfing to divide Americans and get people to not Vote, kinda like Russia did in 2015, and 2019.

* To anyone (not who I replied to); Always remember Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, China, *etc* all have groups of people who can type and read english (or even have Bots do it for them) to make it seem like there is more division than there really is in the USA. They used their IRA to create protests both for, and counter protests for things - including BLM in the 2016-2019's. They will absolutely continue to use their *information warfare* tactics because it is working. Republicans literally live in a different Reality due to this, and multiple tankies and far leftists are convinced Harris will do nothing at all.


For Skepispunk - And the alternative is...... *Bulldozing every square inch of Palestine under Trump, and the complete eradication of the Palestinian people with no rhetoric or push for a 2 state solution*. Fuck dude, at least one of them wants to try and get a cease fire and a possible 2 state solution. Trump **wants** Israel to give a *Final Solution* to them."

Even before 2016, he was out there running as an independent, so he has some degree of history with politics.

I specifically mean solely off of the opinions of celebrities who have literally never been active participants of our government further past being the drivers of policy that only serve to enrich them (like how Ticketmaster has been a parasite on musicians for decades with big names like Pearl Jam getting into conflict with them and losing, but our government only got off their asses and started going after them specifically because they screwed Taylor Swift over)"

Not that she couldn’t have kept old values from before, but it just seems unlikely that she would support Trump.

I really think she gathered a lot of fans that were also racist. Not like fully racist, but a lot of the rhetoric amongst the vocal Caitlin Clark fans was anti rest of the wnba and anti Angel Reese a much as it was pro Clark. It was like they were rooting for her as if the rest of the league was the enemy. It was weird and part of the reason I deleted tiktok."

283," It's interesting how they want to silence anyone who doesn't toe the line with their beliefs. Educating yourself is just a coded way of saying, ""Don't think too hard about your choices."" It seems like a lot of people prefer to stay in their echo chambers rather than confront reality."

If it was only to tell me how you feel, then it´s completely fine. But as an argument against a Trump-voter having valid reasons that are not sinister, it cannot be taken seriously."

289,"And she’s hated on constantly by folk who don’t want a white woman to be the face of the league and bullied constantly by fellow players for the attention she gets. Caitlyn Clark has done nothing wrong, and has been a professional every step of the way but the amount of hate she gets for being white is absurd. By the way calling her the most successful women’s basketball player of all time is.. well, false. She was the highest scoring collegiate player but is still a rookie in the pros, plenty of players are more successful until she wins some championships."

You break the law, you go to jail. The veracity of his indictments is ironclad. Evidence will be presented and Trump will be convicted.

Because you're in the cult and you've been told there is no reliable information other than Trump and his surrogates, you have no ability to actually analyze the evidence presented against Trump. Including just the reality of what we all saw as well as what Trump himself has said. He even admitted to interfering in the election on camera. He has had his lawyers plead guilty to charges in the election scheme. The cognitive dissonance is insane. Not only did he send the people to the capitol, he had a scheme in place to have Mike Pence elect him with slates of sham electors. I'm sure you'll never look into anything but I'll write this up for reasonable people.

Let's not forget the documents case. 

>The charges included willful retention of national-security information, obstruction of justice, withholding of documents, and false statements. Trump took boxes of documents to properties, where they were stored haphazardly, but the indictment centered on his refusal to give them back to the government despite repeated requests.

He refused to return the documents when asked. He also flooded a room they were in. He also deleted security footage. Innocent people are known to try to destroy evidence against them. He waved them around in front of Australian Billionaires. He admitted he was showing press members classified documents improperly. He had his lawyers return some of the documents and sign and affidavit saying they were all there. They were not. 

This isn't the MSM, this is evidence provided and documented. I know no amount of proof is good enough for Trumpers but there is so much more to the legal peril Trump is in and I've omitted several things here for the sake of brevity."

> Biden could get a ceasefire with one phone call to Netanyahu, 

* Or he tried, and Nethanyu said 'lol fuck you'. Did you forget the *possible call* between Trump and Israel, where he *possibly* told them not to find a solution or sign a cease fire because that would make Biden look good? Perhaps that has something to it.

 * (Edit:) *Or, alternatively, the US doesn't have that much say over what Israel does as some people think it does*

> but he won’t because Israel is our colonial outpost if the Mid East.

* This is probably the only *solid* argument you have in these comments - that is exactly why the US backs Israel

> You’re so paranoid you think I’m a Russian agent

* Never called you a Russian agent (read earlier point) - but you're *really* worried about that for some reason.

* I do have empathy - I just *don't think* arguments with *no nuance* are okay.

 * You are correct in calling it a Genocide, I disagree that we are just *allowing it* or are complicit in it, however - otherwise Harris would have the same opinion as Trump on it.

Either we have worldview tied to a person's existence or we have worldview separate from a person's existence.  Currently, there is the notion that the left's worldview is tied to a person's existence, and the right's worldview is separate.

By and large, the people on the right want to be left alone- the idea that you respect me, I'll respect you.  The issue comes in when the non person on the right has the entitlement, expectation, and requirements that their worldview be validated and adhered too, and if not, their existence is being denied.

405,"From my point of view, you seem to be doubling down on the False Equivalency by refusing to give any examples of a conflicting worldview.

There can be obviously conflicting worldviews that don't take into consideration someone's existence. EG: One person's worldview is ""God created everything and has predestined everything, all we need are his teachings"", while another's is ""The world can be explained entirely through natural means, and god does not exist, we need to look to science for guidance"". These two worldviews are conflicting, and person A and Person B will prolly not get along very well.. but taken at their base, neither denies the existence of the other.

It is when someone takes the extra step to say ""God does not exist (or *your specific* God does not exist\*)\*, and anyone who believes in god (or doesn't believe in my god) must be forcibly re-educated/gotten rid of"". If person A believes that all non-believers should not exist, and person B doesn't believe... They are no longer merely having a conflict of views, the views of person A are now conflicting with the very existence of person B (Such as a Protestant during the Spanish Inquisition).

Being intolerant of someone's views (EG: ""Stop it Brad, the world is **not** flat. I'm not debating you on it, you just sound like an idiot when you say it."") is not the same as being intolerant of that person's existence (""S.B. 122 was put into effect today, allowing anyone who is suspected of holding heretical flat earther views to be forcibly rounded up and brought to a re-education camp until such time as they are able to re-contribute to society"").

447,"I'd rather not have Republicans controlling a majority of any federal branches of government or states. It's quite simple, really. Name their signature legislation from the 21st century."
448,"Wishy washy verbs? you mean the ones you used?

You seem to have mistaken what I said for my views.

My stance on these subjects is irrelevant to what I'm saying.

You calling it ""fascism"" because it is a buzz word for the left doesn't make it so, especially when the left is looking through just as many fascist ideologies as the right.

>Nobody is forcing you to have an abortion. Nobody is stopping you from praying in school. 

Yes.  And no body should force, or 'force' me to adhere to something I might not believe in, even if it might include alternate gender identities (I personally don't care if someone considers themselves anything but what they biologically are, just using it as an example).  Again, the issue comes up when that person suddenly goes off the rails, or society punishes (or 'punishes') me for me not validating something someone else believes in."
449,"Yeah, until you realised you messed up. Or didn´t you even get it?"
450,"Except it´s not just criticism. It´s prejudice and hateful to suggest that a Trump voter is all the worst things you think Trump to be. 

That is your feelings talking, not a rational argument for criticism."
451,">Im supposed to be ashamed because I dont tolerate racists, sexists, homophobic bigots who hate America?

Do you yourself even understand what you are claiming here? You really want to claim that anyone voting for Trump is racist, sexist, homophobic bigot who hates America? The funny thing about this is that this is exactly how Trump argues. All feeling, no reason. 

>You can try to smoke screen your hate all you want 

How sad you don´t realise that the ""hate"" is all yours

>the only other thing I have to say to you is stop it. Get some help. You dont have to be like this

Perhaps focus on school and take a break from sm is my sincere advice to you."
452,This approach is insanely illogical and difficult to take serious.
453,">I don't care what their reasons are

Right, you just care about your POV. That is your intolerance speaking. 

>That's not what I said, nor is it what I implied.

Actually, that is actually exactly what your claim suggests. That voting for Trump makes you complicit in all the cruelty he does. Because if not, then what is your problem?

>Please point to a thing that I said that isn't true, and didn't happen. I'll wait.

That is the thing with subjectivity, it might be true to you, but you may not notice that you are exaggerating, assuming and bending the truth"
454,What exactly is garbage? Please enlighten me. Prove to me that you understood my argument.

456,Then endorse her. Let's make Utah a swing state this election 
457,Then do the right thing Mitt!
458,"This is so irritating. He says he won’t vote for trump, but doesn’t endorse Kamala. Wimp. 

 “Earlier this year, Romney said he would not be voting for Trump in the 2024 general election, an announcement that came while President Biden was still running for a second term.”"
459,"I actually wouldn't be terribly surprised if Romney ends up endorsing her in the next couple of weeks. 

I also wouldn't be surprised if he declines to do it, but his choice to praise her with the word ""capable"" to describe her as a person makes me think he's gearing up for a formal endorsement soon."
460,"Intelligent, capable person used to be a low bar to clear, and yet here we are. "
461,MAGA was trying very hard to convince people she was unintelligent.  That Foghorn Leghorn senator from Louisiana was on Fox a month ago calling her “ditzy” or whatever he said.  They're completely deflated now.
462,The path to and through law school shows that too
463,"Time to step up and endorse her. This is about saving our democracy, Mitt. You can play a role in that!"
464,Endorse her and get Trump away from your party.  It's the right thing to do.  Only thing that will start the process of fixing the Republican party is if they get handily defeated this election.
465,There is some logic to spacing out endorsements over time so they have maximum news exposure.   But as early voting starts up they should not wait too long either.
466,Mitt Romney helped usher Trump into mainstream politics. He has a duty to endorse Harris.
467,"He may end up writing his own name on the ballot. But I hope he endorses, and votes for Kamala."
468,"""She's so well-spoken."" 

-Mitt Romney"
469,Love how presidential choices went from policies and belief to who has the most marbles
470,Republicans only sound reasonable when not in office or NOT running for reelection.
471,"When are people going to realize they are being played by Donald Trump and the conservative media?

For weeks, their most significant attack on Kamala was that she was incapable, an idiot, and a horrible public speaker. Worse than Biden, Trump would say! 

Do people realize this was a blatant lie? I would see it parroted a lot on social media."
472,If we’re not careful he’s gonna stick her in a binder.
473,I wonder what it’s like to be the last sane person in your political party
474,Almost there.. just say it.
475,"Come on, Mitt, endorse her!"
476,"We know, Romney. "
477,Shame on him for refusing to endorse her.
478,[deleted]
479,"So stop being a chicken shit and put country before party.

An Obama/Romney Harris commercial could be really effective. They could sing You Say Tomato, I Say Tomato."
480,Unlike Trump.
481,"am i supposed to feel good about him and the cheneys liking harris? i dont respect republican politicians, if they endorsed me i would wonder what the hell i am doing wrong. not gonna buy the Principled Stand for Democracy horseshit either from the very people who set the stage for it to be threatened. feels like cheering on ed gein for joining the force."
482,Didn’t you serve in the Senate with her?  She wasn’t then?
483,"so there are thoughtful members of the gop, shame there are so few"
484,"so there are thoughtful members of the gop, shame there are so few"
485,"The last Republican nominee I voted for. He is a Republican, but not a part of the Trump cult. Being honest about Kamala is refreshing."
486,"Gee thanks for that pearl of wisdom, Mittens."
487,What did these people think in the first place?   Oh right... she's a women....  jeezz
488,Huh?  Was there ever any doubt?  Show me a person an election away from the White House who wasn’t intelligent or capable.
489,What a legend. I’m such a Mitt fangirl
490,Be quiet Romney.
491,Another spineless Republican.
492,She’s good at staying on script no doubt!
493,I hope he does more than compliment her but Utah is pulling the lever for Trump. But a Romney endorsement could sway some undecideds in swing states and encourage more republican politicians to cross party lines. People other than Dark Lord Cheney.
494,She's intelligent and capable. Her opponent is not. I can't give an endorsement and I'm not sure I'll vote for her.
495,Most Utah republicans hate Romney because he does not kiss Trump's ass.  He is retiring because he could never win a primary here.
496,"The Republican I am really surprised has not endorsed Harris enthusiastically yet is Condi Rice. 

The woman by principle is totally anti-isolationist, anti-Russia (influenced in Cold War diplomacy by her favorite professor… Madeline Albright’s father of all people), and staunchly pro-NATO. Forget identity politics, she should have been first in line on foreign policy alone!"
497,"I was watching secret lives of Mormon wives. 


It's definitely a swing state."
498,He can't....he has no cojonies
499,It'd be against his religion to do so.
500,"Amen. Notice, too, the disappearing act of Jeff Flake.  He talked a big game, but whimped out big time."
501,Like when James Cagney went yellow to save the gang from a life of crime!
502,Last two elections he wrote in his wife’s name. He may not vote Kamala but he isn’t voting trump
503,"I think Mitt has done enough, dude has stood up to Trump numerous times and gotten tons of shit for it. He needs a break, lol"
504,"Yeah, this is good, but he could do better."
505,That’s always been his downfall. A big weenie.
506,You seriously think the guy who caught saying all black people are welfare dependent and uneducated will endorse a black woman…? Are people forgetting of Muppet Mitt is?
507,She's in the binder.   That's probably the best he can do.
508,I'm cautiously optimistic that you may be right
509,Right? It used to be the bare minimum.
510,That Foghorn Leghorn senator is a Rhodes scholar who used to be a Democrat and whose accent is completely faked to try to sound folksy and relatable to a dumbed down Republican voter base.
511,The governor of South Carolina would like a word with you for stealing his hard-earned Foghorn Leghorn nickname.
512,Mitt Romney is leaving office because of his criticism of Trump. He’s been critical his whole time in the senate. He was the only Republican to vote for a conviction in Trump’s first impeach trial. Acting like he’s only doing this because he’s leaving office is ignoring what actually happened.
513,"Yeah, no debate performance was required."
514,He's definitely not voting for Trump (except to impeach him). It's just a question if he will publicly endorse Harris.
515,I mean he was the only Republican to vote to Impeach him back in 2021 so I doubt it
516,"um, the guy she debated ;)"
517,Trump
518,At least someone is…
519,Arizona has a HUGE Mormon population. A forceful endorsement from Romney that speaks directly to that group could legitimately swing the state.
520,Last year the official Mormon church statement on voting included guidance to weigh candidate character and choose people who reflect your values regardless of party affiliation. The one I found from ten years earlier didn't contain that language.
521,"Arizona especially, but I think it could make a difference in all the swing states. There are a lot of Republicans/Republican leaning people who are repulsed by Trump but have a hard time actually voting for a Democrat. Every prominent Republican figure that endorses Harris convinces a few more of them that it's okay."
522,"As much as Utah pretends to not like trump, if you spend any time in mormonville (Utah county metro like Provo/Orem/Lehi) which unfortunately I do live near, it's all insane trump train regardless of how much it conflicts with Mormon preachings. At the end of the day it's Mormon Incorporated and what's good for business of the church is always good so they get told to vote R (maybe not told, but highly pressured)"
523,"Mormons don't like Trump. They're very conservative, but they're a different voting block than Evangelicals. 


21% voted for Evan McMullin in 2016. "
524,"Oh, he’s retiring?

Well then, start placing your bets on if he finds his spine in time for the election.  They do always magically seem to find it when they’re going out the door…"
525,Flake endorsed Biden in 2020 and did an ad for his campaign. He also just wrapped up his ambassadorship a week ago. I think Flake probably comes out supports Harris before Election Day. Hopefully Mitt does the same since he’s retiring anyway.
526,">whimped out

Flaked out, even"
527,Or...did he *actually* go yellow?
528,"I'm hoping I'm not being naive, but there is a chance he could be waiting until closer to the election to keep the momentum going. Too much in the news right now, and people will not particularly care anymore come election day."
529,"The bar is so low we think neutral is now good.

Not enough, Romney."
530,Mitt Romney is presently defined by his vote to convict during the second impeachment trial.
531,"Didn't he say 47% of America was welfare-dependent? I can't find anything about black people. 

As governor of MA he supported/proposed a plan to expand healthcare insurance to cover all uninsured people in MA and signed in Romneycare. As presidential candidate he attacked Obamacare despite Obamacare being based on Romneycare. He then later went back and re-accepted credit for Romneycare and therefore Obamacare. I think he's pretty comfortable saying whatever results in political gain in the moment."
532,It will be again. We're going to put this chapter behind us.
533,You're giving him far too much credit.
534,7 Republican senators voted to [convict](.https://www.npr.org/sections/trump-impeachment-trial-live-updates/2021/02/15/967878039/7-gop-senators-voted-to-convict-trump-only-1-faces-voters-next-year)  him after the failed coup attempt.
535,And George Dubya Bush.
536,"If they vote through a sheet, nobody will ever know their shame."
537,"I’m not from the US but I think that Arizona will go to Harris anyway. There are more new younger voters since 2020, trump trashed McCain numerous times and isn’t well liked for his comments about him and covid and old age will have likely killed off some of the die hard republicans (no pun intended).

The abortion ruling imo will be the big sway tho as no self respecting women are going to want to roll back to some archaic old law from 1864.

Purely my opinion but I think Arizona will go blue again this year… but hope I am right. Only happens if people actually vote so from all of us in 🇬🇧 please do go and get orange goblin out of our lives for good. Thanks 🙏🏻"
538,"Romney has huge pull with Mormons, but even the Prophet, President Nelson, revealing a divine order to vote specifically for Kamala Harris could make them vote for a Democrat. 

That's kinda the thing about all movements, religious or otherwise. You get 'em going, and you ride them to power, but I'd you try to turn them in another direction too quickly, they'll see you as one of the bad guys."
539,"Nah, he can't as a mormon actually endorse her."
540,Nevada too
541,"True, but where did the other 80% go?

(I had to go look it up. Trump took over 50% of the vote, with Hilary making up the difference.)"
542,Lol most of my friends and family are Mormons and they all loved Trump up until recently. They're a little embarrassed of him now but will still vote for him.
543,"As much as id like to believe it a good chunk of Mormons are very much on board the Trump Train. The Church has been bleeding members and at this point is courting the conservative bloc for customers, not the other way around. All the sensible people have left already, and a lot of them will vote for him if only to get more tax cuts for the rich."
544,It could simply be timed instead of it being whenever he decides to do it.
545,Romney has consistently stood up against Trump.  He voted to convict when Trump was impeached.  He is one of only a few Republican elected officials who has proven to not be a coward.  Most of the others have already been primaried and removed from office.
546,Romney is one of the ONLY Republicans who has had a spine consistently throughout the Trump era without being on the way out. I hate most of his positions on the issues but he's one of the only ones who doesn't deserve the coward label.
547,"I don’t remember him endorsing Biden. I didn’t even know he was ambassador to Turkey.  Talk about a low profile. 

 How to disappear from the media and keep a decent paycheck.  Become ambassador to Turkey.

That was an interesting conversation between Flake and Biden."
548,Heavens to Murgatroyd!
549,Exactly 👍 
550,"Utah early voting doesn't start until Oct 22nd, so if he plans on endorsing, he might be waiting for that to be the dominant political story when they vote. Between Biden dropping out, Harris's rise, the Walz pick, the DNC, and the debate, it has been a packed news cycle.

Trump is going to do more unhinged shit to turn off voters. Mitt Romney doing a full condemnation of Trump and endorsement of Harris would be super effective around Oct 7-15th for some solid coverage and time for the news to spread while being fresh in people's mind when they vote.

Not saying he'll do it, but if I were him and planned to, I'd be waiting for an optimum timing."
551,"I think you're right. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a group of Republicans coordinating their endorsements. 

I think he'll endorse her. I can see Quale and Ryan doing it too. Unsure about W. It would be nice if he did though, and if they all did then every living Republican President or VP candidate except for Palin would be endorsing Harris. Right now only Palin is endorsing Trump, and the others have said or indicated they would not vote for Trump, but to have them all endorse the Democratic candidate would be very unifying. 

No, I don't care if you (not the person I'm responding to, just in general) don't like those people so please don't respond about that."
552,So he’s suddenly not a raging racist?
553,I’m not giving him *any* credit. I’m explaining the circumstances for why he’s leaving.
554,Yeah you’re right. I forgot the details of the verdict
555,George W Bush looks like Einstein compared to Trump.
556,"All reporting surrounding Bush indicates he's a very intelligent and capable man. 

He put on a front, similar to BoJo, to look more like a clumsy sweet Southern boy."
557,Soak the vote!
558,My first thought was this was a KKK reference lol
559,"Ah yes, the great veil."
560,"What is that?

It is my vote for Kamala Harris?

Will you give it to me?

I will through the veil."
561,"People that vote Dem because of McCain comments are dwindling. It was 4 years ago and they tended to skew older and more traditional Republican.

The younger generation skew liberal, but the conservatives that exist are full MAGA and have little in common with the McCains. Even if the total number of Rs in the state stays the same, the ratio of MAGA to McCain supporters is skewing in Trump's favour as the old die off and replaced by cultists 

I still think Arizona will vote Blue this year, but it will be very close and not representative of what happens under a more traditional Rep candidate, Arizona will continue to have a Maine/NH like reputation for electing independent like candidates that defy traditional party stereotypes (like how Maine justifies voting Collins despite mostly voting Dem)"
562,From your mouth to god's ears!
563,Harry Reid was a Democrat.
564,"Trump only got 45%.


Hilary and McMullin combined got 49%."
565,"I assume Mormons never loved Trump, but were vigorously holding their noses. And now, they got sick and tired of holding their noses, and they can't stand the stench.

Either that, or the religious right is just more blatantly transactional than you or I could imagine. E.g. they got Roe overturned, now they are kicking Trump to the curb."
566,Ambassador to Turkey has to be one of the harder ambassadorships. Definitely the hardest of the NATO countries.
567,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/jeff-flake-other-former-gop-congressmen-endorse-biden-ahead-rnc-n1237826
568,Lol I am old enough to remember that.  
569,He's an opportunist who like Chris Christie is someone trying to gauge the wind and decide which way to go. These aren't mutually exclusive and sometimes the opportunity is greater than his racism.
570,And an obvious wimp. Too weak to actually endorse.
571,I think his disdain of Trump supersedes that of
572,He was the only one who voted to impeach for the Ukraine scandal.
573,"He was the only one to vote for him in the first impeachment trial. You were right about that, just the wrong impeachment year."
574,"In his years after office, i could tolerate him more than i could when he was commander in chief. although i may not see eye to eye with him politically, he did kinda have a southern charm that kinda made me think hed be a cool guy to sit and have a beer with and talk some sh**.  And the guy could sure duck a flying shoe. "
575,Fucking hell I'm annoyed that I get this reference.
576,"Just put your ballot in the box, but don't move it around"
577,Ugh I hope we can get that Senate seat back from Collins in 2 years. Come on Maine!
578,Kari Lake has negative coattails
579,I feel like AZ gonna elect Gallego and Trump this election
580,It's not democrat. It's if you are chill with the church and if they've taken a position.
581,"Whoops, you're right. I got 2016 and 2020 numbers mixed up. Trump did take a majority in 2020 but McMullin wasn't running."
582,"Depends on the Mormon, my grandparents called Mitt a traitor for not supporting trump. Sometimes I feel like the Republican Party comes before Jesus for them."
583,"Depends on the Mormon, my grandparents called Mitt a traitor for not supporting trump. Sometimes I feel like the Republican Party comes before Jesus for them."
584,"> Either that, or the religious right is just more blatantly transactional than you or I could imagine. E.g. they got Roe overturned, now they are kicking Trump to the curb.
  
Overturning Roe is just the first step for the religious right. They want a federal abortion ban."
585,Tells you he has his eye on a Presidential run next cycle.
586,Anyone who needs to gauge the wind on whether they should betray our country or not is pathetic and shouldn’t hold office
587,That Russian money runs deep for Conservatives
588,I’ve been on the internet far too long
589,What? Can you explain this?
590,Of course. But that's a separate issue from his calculus of whether or not to endorse.

592,And Kamala needs every single one of those votes because this one is going to be decided by a handful of voters.
593,"That's \~0.25% of eligible voters in the USA... that it pretty significant. Assuming only half of the eligible voters actually vote and these votes go to Kamala, that's a 0.5% increase for her in the popular vote just from Swift."

/s"
616,"OMG. after reading the importance of Taylor Swifts endorsement to you young folks, I am embarrased for the U.S. Instead you young people should be worried about the state of our economy and who got us there. People can't afford food, gas, energy or other essentials and you want to put a person in that created these problems by being the deciding vote on 50 Bills on all the money US spent that caused this economy. My grandaughter is 15 years old and she is smarter than using something like this to make her decisions.  If you are wealthy I can understand it.  However, if you are looking to buy an affordable home, after working very hard to earn your money this is not how you should be making your decisions. Taylor charges up to 6K for her concerts do you think she cares about the economy?! God help America the voting age should be raised substantially."

621,"That’s 400k people realizing that through voting, you might be able to influence the state of the political landscape."

Not to doom but if it's 400k in Cali that doesn't really matter but say 100k in pa 70k in NC etc could make the difference 


Not to say you shouldn't vote if you arent a swing state absolutely use your rights to vote. "
629,Depressing she can make such a difference. Where the hell have these fans been? This isn't new stuff that's going on
630,"Yeah, I’ll take the advice of the woman who writes songs about all her terrible choices."
631,Correlation vs Causation… look it up.
632,"Cool, a girl who became a billionaire buy singing songs about her bad taste in men endorsed Harris lol"
633,"Sorry but I will vote for a man who had billions that he lost fighting for America.  What is sad that this woman has flown thousands of times, made billions of dollars, and pretends to support climate change and you are all going to vote for Kamala because she supports her?!"
634,"This young woman, who isn’t a child anymore but acts like it, has a life of her own that constantly blows up in her face due to her own decision-making. And someone is going to follow what she says????  I’m embarrassed for our country."
635,Do you really think 400k people clicking on a link on the internet is a big deal?
636,[removed]
637,"Yep. Everyone needs to keep the energy up too. Even this close to the end, it's a marathon not a sprint."
638,I'm doing my part!
639,"The only reason this is a close race is because of cheating… Disenfranchisement and fixed SOS’s.

You are correct but please don’t talk about it like it’s a “close race” and a fair fight. 

Kamala needs all the extra votes to get past the vast corruption "
640,I feel like she's having the same effect that Rock the Vote did back in the day.
641,Swifties starting their political era.
642,"The thing is though, it's really only going to matter if a good number of those votes are coming from certain states"
643,I thought it would be more tbh
644,"And all the fuckery…..vote everyone. Make it a landslide to push MAGA back under the rocks, bridges and holes they climbed out of with their shit"
645,"That's still two big assumptions:

1.) it only means 400k clicked the link, not that they are newly registered after clicking. 

2.) that they will show up and actually vote for Kamala.

If Swift keeps it going and reminds people to check registration and vote early and on election day, if will absolutely matter. But I doubt she will lead to 400k new votes. But the last election was determined by ~30k specific votes, so any amount makes a big difference."
646,"And if your state makes it hard to register or vote (Texas is one example) it’s even *more* important that you vote, AND vote in down ballot races. It’s the only way this shit gets fixed."
647,"And that’s the start of her influence, not the end."
648,"The fact that anyone can say anything pushing Americans to vote is “worthless” says everything you need to know about our American media and the people allowed to be on it. Americans have a fucking atrocious voter turnout. ANYTHING meant to help boost voter turnout, ie: decrease voter apathy, is worthwhile. "
649,"That’s 400k people clicking the link on her insta story. I’m not saying her endorsement won’t make a difference, but it is certainly not 400k registrations."
650,The vast majority of celebrity endorsements are worthless or close to worthless. Swift is an exception because she has such a massive and highly dedicated fanbase. The only one of a similar level of impact in the last few decades may have been Oprah's endorsement of Obama in the primary.
651,"Swifties were never going to vote for Trump. That endorsement didn't take away any votes from Trump.  Taylor Swift has themes in her music and values she sings about and *none* of that appeals to the same people Trump appeals to.

What it did was get people excited about voting.  She didn't convince anyone of who to vote for, she convinced people to vote.  Swifties are almost all young, female, idealistic, feminist, pro-LGBT, and pro arts, and pretty much everything else left leaning.  They would have already voted for Kamala Harris.  She's just getting them to do it.

It's like saying Kid Rock convinced people to vote for Donald Trump.  Of course not.  Anyone who listens to Kid Rock would have already voted for him, if he did anything it would be to get someone to vote who would have otherwise been too drunk on election day to leave the trailer park."
652,Not registrations. Clicks.
653,Hell I’m a 32 y/o man and listened to that job again just yesterday!
654,Haha that's the Taylor I remember too. and the memes of I knew you were trouble with the screaming goat/paper dispenser lol.  I don't listen to her much nowadays but still appreciate her as an artist
655,"I've always liked her, but I gained even more respect for Swift in her message to get young people motivated to vote. Her IG post was really well-written and concise. She really nailed what is at stake in this election. Very smart lady."
656,"Listened to the actual interview. No, there was not a 400% - 500% increase in *registrations*. There was that much increase in *interest* i.e. going to the website. We don't actually know how many of those people actually registered."
657,I talked to Taylor Swift on the phone once circa 2005/6. AMA lol
658,"That’s what I was thinking. I’m not going to be upset about more votes, that’s always good, but who are these people who sit and wait for a celebrity to tell them who to vote for?"
659,"400k visited the site, not registered.

We need to ensure people sign up to vote."
660,"Some people are only just now old enough. And they might have eventually done so anyway, but it's a big loud reminder from someone they respect."
661,400k people did not sign up to vote. 400k visited the website.
662,"Same. I don't hate her music, it's just not really my style. I have mad respect for her business savvy, though."
663,Kind of absurd too what a pedestal we place celebrities on. Like can you imagine this at any other time in history? A popular bard having tangible impact on who sits upon the throne of France or whatever
664,That 400k in the few swing states. The typical Swiftee demographic are dual income professional mothers living in upper income blue state suburbs along the coasts. Their electoral votes are going to Harris no matter what.
665,CNN? Is that you?
666,that´s not a very democratic thing to say. The right to vote is quite sacred.
667,It was Kid Rock’s endorsement that did it for me. 😂
668,"Taylor Swift told people to do their own research and vote for whoever they want, so making up your mind based on what she said isn't even possible."
669,If the voters actually cares about qualified candidates then in a land of 320 million people Trump or Harris wouldn't be in the race in first place.
670,It has been like this for as long as I've been alive.  I remember sean combs pushing the vote or die movement back in the 90s-00s.
671,"Def important, but also, even if they are in CA or NY, maybe they are in House districts that can be flipped, which would help a Dem flip of the House. It already seems somewhat likely, but obviously we can't guarantee anything, and every flip of a seat helps there, especially fighting against all the gerrymandering."
672,"well with the fact of her being the biggest music star in the world currently, we can assume these people are spread all over the states."
673,Hasn’t Trump been divorced 3 times?
674,"This one is direct causation. They have a tracker on the instagram link, so they know *exactly* how many people went directly from the instagram post to Vote.org."
675,"You realize that Trump has had a private jet since the 80s and *doesnt* support climate change, right???"
676,"You seem very upset about the cost of commercials and seem to excuse a Billionaire who charges his cons for NFT's, golden Bibles, and his legal fees. 

Narrator:  That is all."
677,"Even if her link ""only"" brings out 5000 young people in some of the closest swing states like PA, GA, NC, that could be enough for a win for Harris.

Also. The 400 000 are only the ones who actually clicked her link. It doesn't cover all the people that may have been convinced by reading about her endorsement in the News media and social media.

And this election won't be decided by one single event or action. It's the whole picture. This endorsement adds to it, but won't be the one and only factor."
678,"This election comes down to like 1-3 states which have recently had decisive vote margins in the range of 12,000-60,000 ish votes. It’s not a guarantee of anything, but it’s not nothing."
679,It is when the last election hinged on a state where Trump lost by 11000 votes.
680,"Literally doesn't know what ""election interference"" is smh"
681,"Literally troll post.

And aren't you all against unregistered voters? Doesn't this help solve that problem?"
682,"Enabling people to legally access the ballot is interference?

Be honest, people voting the **Wrong** way is interference in the Trumpistas world now."
683,If you think that encouraging people to register to vote is *interference*  - you may not be a friend to democracy.
684,"Cool! Let's ban Mike Pilow, Leon Musk, Fox News, OAN, Alex jones, and every other drifter endorsing trump or giving him money then."
685,"All she needs to to is find 11,780 votes."
686,"And you know the worst part? The government is in on it! They’re literally facilitating so that millions of people can cast their votes. They’re doing it now, and they’ve been doing it for every election. There’s a deep state that subverts the rule of the country by letting people influence who gets to rule, and its seed was sown right back at the founding fathers. The constitution even starts off by rejecting the proper authorities and instead goading “we the people” to insurrect against the state. It’s sickening. 

Thankfully, Trump will end this failed two-and-a-half-century social experiment once he’s president. He will Make America Great Again just like it used to be before things went downhill in the summer of ‘76. "
687,Killing the bipartisan border bill isn't though right? Please take a moment to realize your hypocrisy.
688,Trump has his endorsement from Lee Greenwood.  I'm sure that has driven at least 3 or 4 people to register to vote.
689,How so?
690,I mean at this point it is a sprint and we need to keep sprinting all the way
691,Would you like to know more?
692,The frackers say thank you!
693,How do we fix this level of corruption? I am a nobody but other than voting and donating I don't know what to do. Basically i know the level of shenanigans the Relics are doing is serious and want to do more but have no clue how.
694,Which shows how utterly broken the electoral college is.
695,"Swift is from Pennsylvania and is apparently very popular there, so here's hoping 🤞"
696,I imagine it’s around this number because people are already registered.
697,Swift already repeated the message to go out and vote on the Video Music Awards. I don’t think she’s done.
698,"Here is some actual registration data on this point:

https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/s/5uN99ED7Sl"
699,There's also geography to consider. 10k votes on CA means nothing. 10k in WI or GA could swing the state.
700,I also want people to remember that a LOT of those clicks might have been children who are getting interested in politics (yay!) but are too young to vote.
701,I didn't believe your part about making it hard to vote in texas until I looked it up.  Can't believe that in 2024 it's being done via print out and in person for new registration.
702,It's probably 5% registered so that's an extra 20K+ registrations and 5% of those from a swing state. An extra 1K+ votes in states that are decided by a margin of error will help. Every vote counts.
703,"If you're on the r/taylor swift sub,. you'll see some of the response. "
704,"Moi aussie, monsieur! Those were awesome memories. Super cliché hopeless romantic pop songs with your first love is hard to beat lol. Funny part is I used to make fun of it to make her upset lol. I want to go back and tell myself to brace myself for the fuckening that begins in 2015. It will descend America into a coup and will lead to the president referring to COVID as “the kung flu” in a televised public health security conference. We have lived the most surreal times through Trump. Oh, and a lot of white cops will kill an unbelievable number of black kids. Also, school shootings will happen constantly."
705,Did you reply to the wrong person?

707,"I played music for a year with the twin sisters of a guy who played banjo in her band early on, AMA. 🤣


Completely random - I also recorded a demo track for someone, with Natalie Maines’ cousin on drums. He was at that college for some kind of degree in rodeo. He also had a black eye because there was just enough snow for one of this friends to make a snowball. Friend threw said snowball at his driver side window as he was parking at the studio building… except he had the window rolled down.

Music is a real small world in some genres."
708,"Still, if thers a 10% clickthrough rate thats 40k new voters, assuming they show up"
709,"In our personal lives we all tend to value the opinions of people we respect. It stands to reason that public figures who've earned some measure of respect will have an outsized influence.

Also, let's remember that they're still people. Everyone has political beliefs, even celebrities. They just have a bigger megaphone. We're all here on the internet shouting into the void thinking that sharing our opinions might make a difference. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. It only makes sense for celebrities to use the tools they have available to do the same thing."
710,[removed]
711,Harris is qualified. Trump would get fired from McDonald's.
712,So have a lot of people.  What’s your point?
713,"Trump doesn't charge 6K for an appearance and he admits that he does not support that anything we do will not substantially change climate change.  There are also other scientists that believe that this climate change is partially, not all, as a result of the end of an ice age. My point is she supports climate change she says but then flys through the skys on a daily basis it's hypocritical to say the least."

717,"Man, I'd love to see a big budget sequel. "
718,"Fun fact: before I got into health care I was a consultant for oil and gas for about a decade. Life in oil and gas is so much better under Obama. 

When you loosen restrictions you get a bunch of wildcatters. You might wonder what they are. Basically they're small LLCs they get a few million dollars in investors, secure some rights, do the bare minimum for as cheap as possible to extract the most amount of oil and flood the market. When the well costs more than profit they drive the company into the ground, file for bankruptcy, and the owners walk away without consequence. Leaving the taxpayers to clean up their mess.


What happens is big companies want to stay in business so they follow the rules because they have stockholders to answer to. So, regulation is good. I told guys, look the more work you have to do the more overtime you're going to get. You're not having to pay to make sure it's done right."
719,"Couple things.  If we can get a friendly senate and house we can pass a new votng rights act.  That gets rid of gerrymandering and voter suppression.  That alone probably wins it. 

 Then you could expand the supreme court to get 3 more judges so that its no longer a maga court. 

 Then you could uncap the house so instead of 540 it would be adjusted for population (its been capped since the 1920s leading to a rural tilt for the house even though its supposed to tilt towards population centers) add between 300-800 reps that make it harder to bribe and easier for everyone to know their rep. 

 Then you could make DC and puerto rico states so they are 4 more votes in the senate.

Put all that together and you have guardrails back on democracy."
720,"If your state is not already signed on, work on your local representatives to enact the [NPVIC](https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/written-explanation)"
721,It’s down now.
722,And so many of the voting registration centers have some extremely weird and bizarre hours. 
723,"With how many states are within reach right now, statistically a lot more than 5 percent of those registered will come from swing states. Pennsylvania alone accounts for 3,7 percent of the population."
724,"Click-through and conversions are different. The 400k clicks are ""click-throughs"". 

So the **click-through rate** would be how many people clicked the link divided by how many people saw the post. 

**Conversions** are how many people did the thing you were trying to get them to do once they go where you wanted them to go. 

The **conversion rate** would be how many people did the thing divided by how many people landed on your page through click-throughs. 

So what you are want to see here is conversion rate, not click-through rate."
725,Oh and four different Florida communities
726,"Oh please, go listen to ministers at an African Union assembly speak and compare them to how the idiots of both parties in the US speak.

728,Trump says things that he contradicts on a daily basis as well lol. Telling that you care about one but not the other.

733,The extremely cheap sequels we got are perfect though
734,Thank you for your response. I do appreciate your thoughtfulness. I guess I was thinking before this Nov lol
735,"Thank you. Anything else I can do? I am in NC and the bs with RFK Jr has really pissed me off. First he sued to get on, then he sued to get off after ballots had been printed and ready to be mailed out. It is costing our state money and simultaneously may disenfranchise our overseas military. Not to mention we may miss the national deadline to get ballots mailed out now."
736,"Well my 2 months work telemarketing in online advertising  was wasted.

Joking but yeah then i meant conversion rate"
737,"Harris is a perfectly fine speaker. Trump cannot form coherent sentences anymore. This is just fake ""both sides"" shit asking us to ignore the evidence of our own ears."
738,"Trump was President and I don't care how devoted you are to the Democratic party, you have to know, during his Presidency the economy was much better right up to when Covid hit. The last almost 4 years during her term the economy has caused more people to go into their 401Ks because of all those 50 bills that passed on which she was the deciding vote. You probably are able to pay for groceries, gas, energy and other essentials but most middle income people are not without going into their savings.  They have also raised the cost of Medicare which we have paid for all our lives. I had to get a part time job, but unfortunately I got cancer instead after having the Covid vaccine which they basically forced everyone to get.  So please don't tell me how great she is when 3 months ago all media said was Biden should get her off the ticket because her ratings were so low and she was the worse VP we have ever had.  So yes, I am petrified that this woman who has proved nothing may be our President for at least four years."
739,"Or even a TV series. 


TV series are all the rage right now. Gotta have Casper, though. "
740,"Honestly theres not much other than trying to get friends to get out and vote.  Maybe move to a swing state would help as well if youre remote worker.

Biden has a team together ready to fight any problems that are gonna crop up of election fraud and the like.  

Or maybe kamala could just not certify the vote like trump wanted pence to do lol."
741,Election.Princeton.edu has some good ideas.
742,That level of entitlement is infuriating.
743,"Neither Trump nor Biden are responsible for the inflation we are facing in the US. Because the inflation is not just specific to the US. It’s a global impact of the effects the pandemic has had on the world economy coupled with the wars in Ukraine and Palestine. [Plenty economists](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/07/11/high-inflation-is-largely-not-bidens-or-trumps-fault-economists-say.html) have been saying this exact same thing. 

Also, Kamala hasn’t been the “deciding vote on 50 bills”. [It’s 33](https://ballotpedia.org/Tie-breaking_votes_cast_by_Kamala_Harris_in_the_U.S._Senate), and of those 33, 23 were essentially related to nominations to government positions."
744,"> Gotta have Casper, though.

Looked recently at his wiki, and Starship Troopers is listed as his ""best known work""."
745,The TV series is starting production soon I think
746,"Haha. 

Well... i did move to a swing state (NC) so I am definitely doing my part. Actually a whopping 6 of us of voting age moved to this swing state so maybe I actually can help."
747,Thank you

753,"[Here’s a link to the poll](https://www.marquette.edu/news-center/2024/marquette-law-school-poll-of-wisconsin-finds-52-of-registered-voters-support-harris-48-support-trump.php):

> Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris is supported by 52% of registered voters and Republican former President Donald Trump is supported by 48% in a head-to-head matchup in the race for president.

It looks like back in July, in Marquette’s previous Wisconsin poll, they had Trump leading Harris 50% to 49%, so that’s definitely a great development for Harris! And this poll was taken *before* Trump’s disastrous performance in the debate, so hopefully Harris’s lead will widen even more."
754,"The real question we should be asking is, what the fuck are the other 48% of voters thinking!?"
755,Still. Too. Close.
756,She's looking alright in Wisconsin and Michigan. Pennsylvania is pretty close right now. Keep pushing in all the swing states though!
757,Indies 15% swing to Harris since last poll
758,God PLEASE let this stick. He just showed how incompetent he was for the office at the debate and then how cowardly he was by refusing to do a second.  The people of Wisconsin are smart enough and have enough convictions to do the right thing here and get her to the Oval Office!
759,"Great.. now hopefully this is the same for PA, Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina and Nevada as well"
760,Disgusting how many deluded Americans still watched that debate and Trump’s epic meltdown and think he is fit for office.
761,Let's make it an early evening for the gasbag.
762,"So... half of the registered voters still support this narcissistic moron

I just don't get it..."
763,Is scary that this feeble moron still has 48 per cent
764,The fact the whole country is aware of the debate the other night and 48% of registered voters either still somehow believe “both sides are the same” and are abstaining from voting or are voting for a racist rapist felon with no sound policies who barely has “concepts of a plan” and believes whatever he sees on TV. And the former is somehow aware of the latter yet still believes “both sides same”. This information makes me want to drink an apple seed smoothie.
765,Being above 50% is really good as long as people actually turn out and vote.
766,A lot of people love Shitler in Wisconsin. All comes down to voter turnout.
767,now she just needs the turn out. Go Vote people!
768,Thats it? Should be 80%. Just shows how stupid half the country is
769,You still have to vote
770,That means 48% of Wisconsin’s registered voters have no business living in a democracy.
771,"Keep going!  I’m here in Green Bay and we still have a fight ahead, I’ve seen one Harris/Walz sign thus far (so striking I took a photo)."
772,She beat him so bad. It must hurt to fade away as fast as he is.
773,As a foreigner with no dog in this race - how do 48% of people vote for him?
774,"I think it's a forgone conclusion (has been for a while IMO) that she is going to win Wisconsin and Michigan. Really this entire election is going to hinge on Pennsylvania. If she loses PA, she has to win TWO of:

Arizona

Nevada

Georgia

North Carolina

Not impossible but from a pure game-theory / statistics perspective that's not the situation you want to find yourself in. I really hate that the entirety of a national election is going to come down to one single state, AGAIN. The electoral college is stupidest political mechanism on the face of the planet."
775,I’m one of them!
776,So....what in the F*** is wrong with the other 48%?
777,This is all well and good. But frankly I'm getting tired of polls reporting the opinions of registered voters. I need to hear where the *likely* voters stand. I've seen elections where those two definitely differ and it's the likely voters that cast votes.
778,"What about likely voters, though?"
779,"Is 52% of voters enough to win the Electoral College or is this one of those old ""land chooses the president"" bits?"
780,"How the fuck are the numbers so close?  Trump is a painted ghoul, FFS!?!?"
781,"Goddamnit, *why is this race still so fucking squeaky*?"
782,It is extremely concerning to me that she isn’t whipping his ass in polls. The fact that she’s just barely squeaking by is indicative of the problems we are refusing to face in this country.
783,They’re keeping it close for ratings. This will be a blow out. Vote
784,"Yeah each day is becoming apparent Wisconsin is out of reach for the orange man. Good.

But we must still vote."

793,The percentage is not high enough please get out your vote and help Harris & Walz sail smoothly to victory
794,These polls are cool and all but we have to remember that they’re still polls. Go vote please
795,"Did they somehow get a poll of 100% of the registered voters? 

No. This is just the statistic of who bothers showing up to give their response. That's why polls are worthless. People eat it up though, clearly."
796,"How hard, realistically, would it be to get it to 60%?"
797,"Went to the state fair for the first time since 2018 and was relieved to see that only a handful of people were in MAGA gear, of them only one was above voting age and that all of them invoked disgusted groans from the other fair goers."
798,Keep it climbing

It's also known as the ""Alan Keyes Constant"", because it was coined in response to the 2004 Illinois Senate election where Barack Obama trounced Alan Keyes. It states that, in a two-party election, each candidate is guaranteed roughly a quarter of the vote, thanks to diehard partisans who will always vote straight-ticket red or blue out of sheer antipathy for the other party, no matter how extreme or unpalatable their candidate is.

> The backstory: in 2004, the Illinois GOP named Alan Keyes as its last-minute replacement in the US Senate race after their original nominee Jack Ryan was forced to drop out after the details of his acrimonious divorce from his ex-wife, the actress Jeri Ryan (best known as Seven of Nine on Star Trek: Voyager), were released to the press and turned into a scandal. Keyes had to deal with the baggage Ryan left him, he was from out-of-state and had no local political base, both he and Obama were black (meaning racism wasn't at play), Illinois is a deep-blue state, and Keyes is a fringe Christian Right activist known for inflammatory statements. In other words, everything was stacked against him in this race.

> He still won 27% of the vote.

That means for 48% ""support,"" you can reliably subtract 25% to get to the real, possible if remote, chance to change some minds.

802,Don’t get complacent! Please make sure to check your registration and vote! Also please consider volunteering to help get the vote out!!
803,Wow.  Wisconsin either has a population that is 48% billionaires or 48% stupid.
804,"Cmon, Wisconsin. We can do it."
805,I believe she will win Wisconsin.The demographic of Wisconsin has changed over the years.A lot of people from Chicago have moved to Wisconsin.abd they have a lot of young adults voters. 
806,"I still don't think polls tell the whole story. How do you measure how many of their supporters will actually show up? To me it seems like liberals are excited and stoked to vote for Harris, whereas I think a lot of Trump voters are probably just more like anti-democratic voters. 

But I guess at the end of the day I think a larger percentage of Kamala's 52% voters there will actually show up just like they are doing at her rallies. Whereas I think more of a percentage of Trump's 48% there won't show up just like they aren't at his rallies anymore.

Not that we don't all have to still show up and vote, but like come on I just don't think Trump will win. And I definitely said Trump would win the 2016 Election before you come at me about it. I was right then, I was right in 2020 and frankly I think I'm right now."
807,WI looks good but how is PA?
808,The other 48% support the orange one?
809,"Kamala is going to win Wisconsin and Michigan.  That gets her to 251.  The problem is that the other five swing states are all tossups and she needs either Pennsylvania or two of the Sun Belt states.  Certainly quite possible, but not a slam dunk either."
810,"I know it's been said before, but the fact that it's *only* 52% baffles and saddens me.  How the hell can you vote for the guy who says the things Trump said during the debate?"
811,Biden won the state so her being up by such a small degree not super comforting
812,+/- what %
813,"How is it still this close? A convicted felon, liar, rapist, can’t even speak properly, completely losing mental capacity, and yet people still vote for him? It really is like there are two completely different americas"
814,"[Lawrence O'Donnell](https://youtu.be/SsaE_UDBmZY?si=6zWq12P8Zu-iVI-G&t=373) pointed out that the last two Presidential elections in Wisconsin were decided by less than a percentage point. For either candidate to be up by this much shows a real shift. 

Usual caveats: polls aren't elections, polls are only snapshots in time, margins of error are there for a reason, polls have been wrong in the past, etc."
815,I hope 100% of them actually vote
816,Wisconsin has had big polling errors in  recent elections. Could be well ahead or still a bit behind.
817,"Wisconsinite here. Please make sure you are registered: [https://myvote.wi.gov/en-us/Register-To-Vote](https://myvote.wi.gov/en-us/Register-To-Vote)

Then make sure you vote!"
818,Seems low
819,So 48% are traitorous fascicts. Got it.  
820,"I know that you need propaganda but no one’ll ever pass from one side to the other. No one really love Harris, there are persons that love Trump and persons that hate him."
821,According to MSM(MSNBC) polls. 🤦
822,[removed]
823,They are eating the dogs!
824,Its worth pointing out that trump will do even worse over time because hes hemorrhaging voters
825,Marquette is a conservative religious college.
826,Nothing.  Nothing at all.
827,If I go by me repub coworkers is they don’t care about trump and they don’t care about Harris. They’re repubs and that’s how they vote. Show them any facts you want it won’t matter.
828,I am sorry that those 48% are so stupid.
829,Fox News does the thinking for them
830,"* Billionaires are good at business deals. He will bring back jobs to America.
* Republicans actually care about the police and want criminals off the street.
* Look how bad crime is now, it's all those migrants.
* They are eating pets in Illinois and Colorado.
* Why should we care about Ukraine. Aren't they mostly Russians anyway.
* Why are we giving aid to Palestinians? Let's Israel take it. Those Muslims have no right to that land.
* Abortions are happening at 8 and  9 months.
* I heard they are killing babies after they are born.
* Trump won more counties than Biden. Look at how much red is on that map. Ain't no way Biden won with a few blue spots like that.
* January 6 wasn't a riot. The police let them in and let them tour the building. The ones who broke or stolen stuff were Antifa.



That's how"
831,Racism.
832,"They are thinking that Trump is a bigot just the same as they are. I’m from Wisconsin, and the northern part of the state is owned by white racist assholes, and they’re *proud* of it. They don’t even try to hide it anymore."
833,They are thinking that if Trump doesn't establish a dictatorship the rule of white men over the US will come to an end.
834,"Racist stuff, hateful stuff, bigoted stuff…

That is all conservative ideology is boiled down to now, undeniably so."
835,A cult. Nothing will change their minds. We need to outvote them
836,"In the bubbles they live in,  reality looks way way different."
837,They’re thinking ‘my parents voted republican so i will too!’ or ‘trump is the man i aspire to be!’
838,"Unfortunately so many people treat politics like sports teams. So they’re just voting “team red” because they want to “own team blue.” While fine in sports, it’s completely stupid in politics where this stuff affects everyone’s lives."
839,They aren't. They are either party loyalists or uninformed people. Or both. Usually willfully ignorant.
840,"""derp"""
841,"They're at the point where they hate Trump and think he's a bad person, immoral, and a bully.  But they also see him as a ""tough guy"" (he's not, he's easily manipulated) who is good with the economy (he isn't, he's filed for bankruptcy multiple times) and will push around world leaders on behalf of America (he won't, he will sell out America to the highest bidder).  

The sad thing is, Trump has fed his supporters so much fear and hate and anger that they WANT to be in charge and beat the other half of America into submission.  They see democrats as ""the enemy"".  They want a dictator as long as he looks out for them as ""his people"".  They want to wear the uniforms and attack others who aren't like them and take their stuff and make them pay if it means they benefit and it makes them feel big."
842,Sunk cost fallacy
843,"You'd be surprised how in a bubble a lot of rural people are. I've been to their homes, they are stuck in 1970 at best."
844,They have a smooth Brain. No ridges or lumps. Valleys or bumps. Thoughts slide off. Like a water fall.
845,"Yep. The fact that about 45% of voters are going to try to put a convicted felon, adjudicated rapist, and wannabe dictator into the White House is overwhelming evidence that America is a country with way too many racist idiots."
846,"Go out and vote. 

Sincerely,
Europe"
847,"That's millions of people who will turn their discrict red. 

Its gonna be really close which is depressing as fuck"
848,HOW is Penn so close though?! I don't GET that! How is the big cities there not compensating for the blue shift?! Is the rural area larger in population or something?!
849,It would be funny if Texas suddenly flips blue 😏 That's massive 36 points of F.U. to Trump.
850,"Yea, Pennsylvania is the most important state in the election imo. Even if Harris wins every single state Biden did in 2020, but loses Pennsylvania and Georgia, she would lose the election (even if she wins MI, WI, AZ, *and* NV). Whoever wins Pennsylvania is *strongly* favored to win the entire presidential election."
851," It's interesting to see how the swing states are shaping up. I think the polling can change a lot in a short time, especially with things like debates stirring the pot. Just gotta hope people come out and vote; that's where it all counts, you know?"
852,"Biden was up 6 and won by 0.5, Clinton was up like 4? And lost by .5 in Wisconsin. These are not winning numbers for Wisconsin."
853,But the left told me Michigan is lost and arab voters are supporting Jill Stein by huge margins!
854,"It’s looking like Wisconsin and Michigan are going Harris and Arizona is going Trump. 

So it’ll be really interesting to see Nevada, if it goes Harris all she needs is 1 of the East Coast states."
855,"Trumpy doomers: “clearly nothing. Biden has a bigger lead in the polls, and, duh, nothing ever changes”."
856,Great sign
857,60 million people tuned into that
858,"In my fairly rural area of Michigan, where trump won in 2016 and 2020, the dude has a serious enthusiasm problem.  2020 saw the percent of trump voters go up from 2016, but turnout was lower than it was in 2016.  No one is wearing MAGA shit, flying MAGA signs from their trucks, no one is building giant yard signs out of full sheets of plywood, and no one even wants to talk about politics right now.

  I think we might have actually found out how long you can keep the outrage dial on 11, and still get a net positive result from it."
859,"At this point, I don't think they think that at all, but most will probably vote for whoever has the R next to their name."
860,This poll is pre debate
861,Deplorables
862,"That's because, like me, you probably haven't gone a single day without hearing trump's name since 2016.  Most people barely get any political news until an election is just months away.  Most of the shit trump did between 2016 and now, might as well have never happened as far as most people are concerned.

It's like college basketball.  If you are into it, you know the teams, the players, their records, you make your brackets, and you watch the games.  You can probably recite the winners and the epic matchups going back for years.  

If you are as interested college basketball as I am, you probably didn't watch a single game and have no ideal who played or who won."
863,"Yes, the Left is not smart."
864,"We here in America are asking the same thing.
His “political” career should have ended when he made fun of that disabled reporter"
865,"A few things actually, some are just plain stupid. Some are people that know they won’t be affected by his policies, white people. And others are racist facist that want Trump to hurt others. They want him to go after immigrants, minorities people they dislike.
And we can’t forget the small portion of people that like to see the world burn. They think it’s funny to vote for him"
866,Likely voters were the same.  She is up 3% with RV and 2% with LV since July.  This poll was from before the debate so id hope it improves more next time.
867,"Polls use data from previous elections to correct their predictions.  Both Hillary and Biden underperformed their polling, so the polls now reflect a pro-Trump bias, accounting for the ""silent"" Trump voter.

What this means is that if these polls are wrong, they will be wrong by over-correcting for Trump.  The other markers of how an election is going (money raised, new voter registration, enthusiasm, likability, advertising money spent, money spent on get-out-the-vote efforts, money spent on canvassing, phone-banks and general ""ground game"", celebrity endorsements, etc.) all heavily favor Harris.

In the end, I think it will be a comfortable win for Harris, but the polls will say it is close until election day."
868,"Trump's base is still in big part made up of old people. They don't do anything else, so they will 100% show up to vote. Young people are loud, but they don't show up. 

It's actually a big problem in Puerto Rico, where young people are simply not voting at all. It's less of a problem here, but when the race is so close anything matters."
869,It’s a poll from Marquette university. MSNBC has nothing to do with it.
870,I don’t think I’ll go to the capitol and end up in prison for years for a dude that doesn’t give a shit about me that’s for sure.
871,Are you okay?
872,This dude is delulu.
873,"You may be right, he may win. But it will absolutely be a close race. And people will get over it quicker than you think, but it’s right in our faces at the moment (and providing entertainment) so it’s much bigger right now."
874,"Yeah, you sound like a well-adjusted human being who is *totally* not projecting."
875,They are eating the cats!
876,the remixes i’ve seen on tiktok are wild 😂
877,If only this soundbite had dropped before Kobayashi vs Chestnut. The memes could have been truly lit.
878,It’s not Donald’s fault. Someone changed the station while they were interviewing Joey Chestnut.
879,The trend line is definitely the important part here. A +3 swing for Harris in 2 months should be majorly concerning for Trump with almost 2 months left before the election
880,The polling operation is top notch.
881,It’s a Jesuit school. It’s not that conservative.
882,Stupid sexy Flanders
883,It's almost like I'm voting for nothing at all!
884,"Well, they should stick to thinking of nothing. Not even voting."
885,Maybe Kodos?
886,My husband is one of them. I can confirm this.
887,‘Tis a shame.
888,Call em sheep
889,"Yes this entirely. My family is the same way. They hate Trump and dont want to vote for him, but they will anyways because they're republicans and they only vote for republicans"
890,"It's strange how blindly supporting a political party is seen as acceptable, even admirable. Why can't they stick to sports or something that doesn't affect other people for their unconditional support?"
891,"I don’t live in Wisconsin, but this is the case for my Republican family and neighbors. Even now they don’t particularly like Trump, but they are obligated to justify him to themselves and defend him from others (me) because he’s a Republican and Republican good Democrat bad."
892,"I have several coworkers who will take every opportunity to say how much they hate Trump. But will be voting for him because he has an R next to his name.

It's also worth noting these people are part of a privledge class that won't have to worry about much of the negative surrounding another Trump term, so naturally they don't care. They'll be fine either way."
893,Because that is a lot easier than actually using your brain. I bet many of them didn't go to college either.
894,"Straight line voters, both sides have them, I know these people."
895,"But try explaining this to people stuck in an echo chamber...

Literally 80% of American voters will vote and vote for a specific party because they feel it’s their duty to vote, they voted the same all their life, their parents voted for the same party, and their friends and relatives do the same.

“Omg, they are horrible bigots!”
Vs
“They’ve been pulling the same lever in the voting booth since the 80s. Their parents have done the same since Eisenhower or Dewey.”"
896,"""Mr. Trump, please tell us your plan for the US economy?""

""My opponent's father studied Marxism, and there are immigrants eating dogs. Thank you""


""okay....""



I mean, how is this someone who you want to hand over control of the country to?"
897,Fox News is liberal now. It's Newsmax and horrifically antisemitic YouTube channels
898,"They've been asking this same question for 9 years, and for 200+ years this has been the answer."
899,"It's such a shame, because that area of the state is beautiful. Same with the Michigan U.P. Gorgeous places full of far too many awful and/or awfully confused people. Do better!"
900,Most of them that I've met don't even think THAT hard about it. They are about as intellectually shallow as a rain puddle.
901,The result of propaganda
902,"I want every single person to realize when women, queer folks, disabled people, and people of color bitch about the system and privilege, it's because half of the people we encounter on average every goddamn day either hate us or at the very least will let us live in misery/die so they pay a few hundred dollars less on their taxes at the end of the year. 

It's not fun to live this way. I'm exhausted."
903,"I'm not an accelerationist or anything, but I feel like we need a divorce citing irreconcilable differences."
904,"Trumps biggest voting base is exurbs and small cities (think neighborhoods with strip malls or Lancaster, PA), and PA has a lot of both."
905,"Don't take the polls as 100% accurate, ever. They aren't and will never be accurate."
906,"A bunch of factors.  Pittsburgh obviously votes Democrat like most major cities but is only ""moderately"" favoring Democrats unlike the overwhelming support they receive in Philly.  Philly itself, while overwhelmingly favoring Democrats, has suffered from voter turnout issues in the past.  Then of course rural Pennsylvania is so red it's nicknamed Pennsyltucky."
907,Would be nice if flordia turns blue and we all breathe a sigh of relief on election night
908,"> It would be funny 

That's an unusual way to spell *epic*"
909,"Texas would be more than just 36 votes.  It is hard to understate how devastating and symbolic losing Texas would be to the GOP.  It is worshipped as a utopia for conservatism.  The entire state government is controlled by GOP supermajorities helmed by three of the worst humans with U.S. Passports - Paxton, Patrick and Abbott.  If the voters managed to flip Texas, it would destroy the GOP."
910,"My expectation is Texas will remain red this year but will be an very light red, by next election it'll be considered purple.

I suspect NC will go blue but in a very purple way that gets challenged."
911,"I think FL is more likely at this point, but I’m honestly not counting either of them out, whereas usually I would. It would make my year if Trump loses the state he claims as his home."
912,"unfortunately, There's been a lot of conservatives that moved here since Covid, and a lot of liberals have been leaving due to abortion restrictions, etc."
913,"If Texas and Florida flipped blue, we would consider this the biggest electoral victory since Reagan."
914,"If FL and TX flip blue, we could see 400 EC votes for Kamala.  The memes, reactions and hilarity will be off the charts.

(So get up off your asses and go vote to make it happen!)"
915,Not going to happen and I hope we don’t try to pursue that. It’s be a waste of money and time.
916,"It's entirely possible this time around. However, Abbot and his asshole admin down there will throw a wrench in the mix if that happens, I promise you."
917,Very doubtful it'll happen.
918,"Yes, the only path to 270 for Harris without PA or GA would require flipping a 2020 Trump state, like NC."
919,"Unfortunately we won't know for a few days, because by law Pennsylvania doesn't start counting mail ballots until election day."
920,"That is to assume that the polls will be exactly in line with previous polls, which is always a big assumption. Many many new voters around and abortion has been a game changing issue"
921,"People need to understand that poll methodologies change every cycle. You can't make a comparison between cycles without diving into the methodology changes.

Most pollsters are trying to account for their 2020 inaccuracy by sampling more republicans in 2024. So of course the numbers are tighter."
922,Don’t assume that past polling errors will be relevant to this election
923,"“Harris is up?!? These are not winning numbers.”

It’s like this guys doesn’t understand that pollsters constantly refine their models or something.
Good luck, dude. Rhetoric is as visible as vinyl."
924,Wisconsin has had a pretty strong run of liberal wins in Governor and State Supreme Court elections. There are a lot of democrats here that are energized over the first election without the extreme gerrymandering districts at the state level too so I’m cautiously optimistic.
925,There is so much denial going on right now it’s insane. The map will be 2016 again. They didn’t learn how to compensate for how trump under-polls from 16’ to 20’ so there is no reason to believe they’ve done so now. Dropping Biden (someone we know *can beat* trump) will be seen in time as one of the biggest political fuck ups in modern history.
926,Today Stein said the House has 600 members so her brain is more fried than any pollster.
927,"HOW IS AZ GOING TRUMP?! EXPLAIN THAT LOGIC!!! AZ has been flipping, but how they FLIPPING TO TRUMP?!! Where those Arizonan Democrats at?!!!"
928,It is good sign but we need to keep pushing.  Don’t think this election is locked.
929,"When I watch sports with my grandpa, I usually pick a random side based on who's winning or which uniform I like the best, and he goes crazy 😆 

This is what I imagine independent voters are like and then the rest of us are going apeshit about how it's so fucked up to be even considering Trump."
930,"The statistics for which states have the highest literacy rates, graduation rates, best education system and highest IQ all disagree with you."
931,🙄 ok buddy. Vote against your best interests.
932,His political career never should have began. He was a failed businessman turned reality tv star. Zero qualifications to work in government. Just the loudest fucking mouth in every room.
933,"Do you have any proof of this, though? That's huge if true."
934,Wisconsin is a blue state. Next.

936,They are eating the pets!
937,"Hide yo dogs, hide yo cats!"
938,Eat the cats eat eat the cats…
939,The memes have been hilarious too.
940,"Trump is just screwed, his only chance is just pushing misinformation like crazy"
941,Nothing would be preferred. This is Mr. Burns.
942,"Don't blame me, I voted for Kang."
943,Tell him Election Day is Wednesday this year
944,"Yep, I work in Agriculture and I deal with so many idiots who literally think Democrats are worse than murders, rapists, and pedos.  They don’t even really know why they hate democrats, but they hate them like the South hates the North."
945,Best approach with people like this is to agree with them that Trump is a horrible representative for the Republican Party. Then toss in something like how you don’t like how Dems pushed out Biden or think Harris should have had to win the primaries instead of having the nomination handed to her. At that point say you are going to either not vote or vote 3rd party for president while still voting party lines down ballot to send a message to the party for selecting a bad candidate. Hopefully it will plant a seed that if they still want to vote they have an option other than Trump or Harris.
946,Cause they don’t care they are just angry and single issue voters. Easily manipulated and easily riled up
947,Straight line voting for democrats is the only rational choice in the context of the current republican party.
948,Straight line voting for the party of human decency is just… being decent humans. That’s the way most ppl are.
949,"I have voted the democratic ticket exclusively because they best represent my ideals. No party has come along to change that. It's not a habit
 I'm an informed voter and .i haven't been brainwashed.  I stay informed. I am a Democrat. "
950,"“Well Mr Trump, you studied business at Wharton an clearly don’t know anything about it…”"
951,This is really what breaks my brain.
952,"Honestly, that is basically the debate"
953,Hardly
954,"That's no excuse for turning off your brain and voting for him -  especially in the U.S., where they have access to other information channels too."
955,And racism and misogyny and extremism religion and lack of education.
956,"And ignorance.  Most people pay so little attention to politics, they really don't know anything about the candidates or issues.  They assume that anything negative they hear about their side is just campaign lies.  They just show up to vote for their ""team"" and pat themselves on the back for doing their civic duty.

There are also a certain amount of people who will always vote for whichever party is in power or out of power, regardless of their own political views.  Some think it's essential to change things up every 2 or 4 years, and some want to stay the course, no matter where it's been or where it's going."
957,and it wasnt even domestic propaganda it was from russia
958,"Is there something about that demographic, or is that where the 'america is decaying' kind of rhetoric hits hardest?"
959,"As someone who lives in Lancaster County, Trump will not win Lancaster city. No Republican has won Lancaster city in my 30 years of life on earth. He'll win a lot of the boroughs and townships around it - Paradise, Blue Ball, Strasburg, Manheim Borough (not Township), Willow Street, and so forth, though. It isn't the small cities or their immediate suburbs, it's a few miles down the road still where people get fucking stupid."
960,"My family lives in Johnstown Pa, one of those small towns. 

My aunt who’s very Republican hates the guy, and a good chunk of her Republican friends want to see Kamala win or they will not vote for him, while voting down ballot. 

FWIW she worked for national intelligence and had a ton of clearances, and soon as the document stuff came out she was gone."
961,"Keep your eye on the ball: Texas. It won't happen this time, but when it does in 8 years or so, swing states won't matter."
962,Ya... anything is so possible. So nervous but very excited for this election 👍
963,If Florida goes blue I’m sleeping like a goddamn baby
964,"It could be within reach for the Dems. Florida Senator Rick Scott won his last election by only 10,000 votes! With 300,000 Haitians eligible to vote in Florida, many are upset that Trump and the GOP are accusing Haitians of eating pets! The tweet of two Haitians running behind Trump while he holds a kitten, doesn't help the GOP in Florida!"
965,"If either of those things happen, the GOP is going to shatter"
966,Yeah if I could go to bed early that night that would be great.
967,"If the democrats hadn’t abandoned Florida over the last 10 years, it would have been very possible"
968,The GOP IS destroyed - there's a marked split between the far right racist looneys and the true moderate conservatives that I'm not sure it can or will survive. I can see the maga crowd going with whatever Dump-flavoured party emerges and the others coalescing into a more left-leaning conservative party and get the former Republican voters who aren't actual shitty human beings on their side but I don't think the Republican party is actually long for this landscape.
969,"I feel the same, probably not this year but but there's some hope. We'll get there either way!"
970,"Before we get too excited, we’ve been saying that for 10-15 years. That’s why they’ve leaned so hard into voter suppression, and it’ll get worse and worse until it finally snaps. It’s the end of the GOP is they lose Texas, and I do think it’ll eventually happen."
971,I could see that :(
972,NC always seems to be on the menu but always manages to disappoint. Georgia has shown up when the country needed them in the midterms and the last general election. I think GA delivers again.
973,"She's nearly outside the MOE in North Carolina already. Even if trump overperforms by 1.5% he still loses the state. Which at this point is not impossible but I would call it relatively unlikely. The polls in 2022 were incredibly accurate, so they may be starting to represent data more accurately in the modern era as well."
974,"~~If she wins all states Biden won except PA and GA she‘s still at 270 isn’t she?~~

Edit: See below."
975,"Also worth noting is the polls for senate all have the democrats way WAY above any margin of error. What's the chances Baldwin, Slotkin, and Casey (Gallego, Rosen, Kaine, Stein) win but Kamala loses?"
976,"Indeed. Look at the midterms, polls had everyone talking red wave. Polling generally is broken now. Can’t rely on the good faith of responders, the country is so divided the margin of victory is always within the margin of error of a poll so it’s technically accurate, not to mention the sheer amount of pollsters flooding the aggregate sites even make those fairly useless. They can give you a statistically correct poll, properly leveled and give you any result you want really. Good or bad poll you can find issues in most of them looking at the cross tabs."
977,They adjusted their 2020 methodology to fix their 2016 inaccuracy resulted in even bigger errors in some states (e.g. GA and FL).
978,"They said the same thing after 2016, and it was even more off. I’d also add that she doesn’t even have a lead atm, it’s within the margin of error. She could be +3 in the next 7658 polls and it would still be a toss up due to the margin of error."
979,"Don’t talk when you don’t know what you’re talking about. They “refined” their model from 2016, and were even further off. Sure bud, they will fix it this time."

981,They’re is no reason to believe they didn’t either.
982,"Its a super tight race it is a coinflip. Saying ""looks like its going Trump"" when polls have them within a percent is silly. Kari Lake is not polling well which is a good sign. But just like the country as a whole it's just too tight to say anything definitive. People need to turn out."
983,Idk I just check the polls a lot and he seems to be trending in AZ. The more recent ones have him up like 3%.
984,The democrats going more right wing in immigration but cause some people to sit out.
985,Never think the election is locked. That’s what Hillary did and now we’re dealing with this shit. Don’t lose hope but don’t slack off.
986,The cities all agree. 🤦
987,You mean anti pedo people? Chancla Harris(flip flopper extraordinaire) supported someone who showered with his own 12 yo daughter and sniffs prepubescent kids.
988,In 2020 it was decided by 0.63% points and in 2016 by 0.77% points. Once blue once red. If Wisconsin isn’t a battleground state then nothing is.

1002,"Yep, another classic effort to 'both sides' an issue that isn't based in reality. 

Straight line Republican voters are the way they are because their daddy, and his daddy, and his daddy, and his daddy all voted Republican. That's all there is to it. No further thought or introspection beyond that.

Straight line Democrat voters are the way they are because Democrats are the only ones even remotely trying to improve society in any way, as opposed to installing a theocratic fascist dictatorship. 

Both sides are not the same."
1003,"Some people will vote party no matter who the candidates are, whether GOP or Democrat, because that is how they always done it, because their family vote party X and their parents just always voted for party X and so on.  These are a minority, but they certainly are out there.  Some of them will got straight blue every time."
1004,"Agreed, I’d love a functioning two party system but so long as one party is simply anti fact and anti human decency I’m a blue voter by default."
1005,"Yet another fucking lie he never got called on. Wharton is a post-grad school at the school that he went too. He has a bachelors degree (supposedly). That's like going to Harvard for a bachelors and saying you have a degree from Harvard Law. 

Every fucking thing he says is a lie. So fucking stupid."
1006,Tell that to my mom
1007,"I mean, yes and no. In a place like NY or California, I would agree with this sentiment. In places like Florida, Texas, Alabama? Education is absolutely gutted there. It’s the real reason they want to shut down all the libraries.

They made these people stupid on purpose because it plays to their aims."
1008,"I feel like it’s complicated when people were conditioned to trust the news, not taught to be discerning of information in a world that changed so drastically since they were educated, and the news channels play to their psychology to make them scared and get hooked on watching to be “aware of dangers,” plus rampant loneliness in the elderly that means they spend so much time alone watching TV and not with people questioning their ideas "
1009,Explanations aren't necessarily excuses
1010,"You just described my in-laws who supports trump because ""everyone hates him"" despite voting for him goes against their self-interest. When pressed further, they default to ""I care about the economy only""."
1011,My wife is from Lancaster. Her family is mostly voting red. They honestly live in a bubble. My MIL is unsure of buying airplane tickets for next year to meet our next child (we live abroad) because she's worried about civil war.
1012,"The answer is rooted in generational racism. If you don’t know what the term [white flight](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight) means, start reading there."
1013,"Yeah that demographic longs for the ""good old days"" and I don't mean the 1980s.  I mean when their ancestors could own black people."
1014,"Texas: ""oh man, so weird that two million people lost their voter registration.  So weird.""

Paxton is a fucking criminal, and every member of the Texas government who supports him still being there is too, by proxy."
1015,"Texan here (check my user name).  I voted for Trump in 2016.  I thought he was better than Hillary.  During his presidency I woke up to how much actual bullshit he was spewing.  During the Florida Hurricane, During Covid, After Covid, and beyond...nothing but lies.  

I couldn't vote for him again in 2020, but didn't want to vote for Biden as I dissagreed with some of his policies, and had honestly voted red my whole life.  I also used the excuse that, ""Texas is a red state, so my vote doesn't matter.  I won't vote for Trump, but also won't vote for Biden, that way if something goes wrong, I can bitch about it either way.""

I'm done thinking that way.  Trump is the worst thing that has ever happened to this country.  I WANT Texas to go blue.  I WANT Trump to lose so badly that there is no possible way he can say ""Election Fraud"".  If Texas turns blue, there will be NO DOUBT that Trump lost. 

I'm voting Harris/Walz this year. I think she actually cares about regular Americans like me.  I think she wants to help with the economy and taxes, and Abortion.  I'm personally not FOR abortion, but I'm super not for telling women (or anyone really) what they should or shouldn't do with their own bodies.  

edit:
Let's get rid of Paxton and Cruz while we're at it!

I urge ALL texans that don't like Trump to vote blue.  Don't be like me.  Don't assume that just cause the state is generally red, if you vote for something else, you're throwing your vote away.  Throwing your vote away is giving it to someone that will only get 1% of the votes.  Make your vote count."
1016,"I've been hearing Texas is eight years from turning Blue for the last 30 years.  Does seem to be trending that way, just too slowly."
1017,"That's why there was interest in running Beto for president a few years ago.  If a Texas Dem wins his home state, he wins the election."
1018,"That is why you see rich Republicans moving from California to Austin.  They know they have no chance of flipping California but they can try to keep Texas red because if it goes blue, they never win the EC again."
1019,"Texas, OH, FL will not flip until HR1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights bill pass"
1020,">Keep your eye on the ball: Texas. It won't happen this time, but when it does in 8 years or so, swing states won't matter.


- Hopeful Democrats since 1992."
1021,"if FL goes, I'm blaming the eating dogs thing. Lots of Hatians in Florida who dont like being painted as targets for blood libel."
1022,Imagine Florida going blue and being called before midnight on election night. Trump would lose his mind and we can all go to bed early.
1023,And lots of boomer repubs dying of Covid
1024,Good
1025,I really wish we had a parliamentary government.
1026,NC wasn’t as in play last year as it seems to be this year.
1027,No PA is 19 and GA is 16 so 35 total and Biden had 303 and need 270 to win. So she would need to take NC to win without both of those.
1028,The senate races have a lot of undecided though. If they’re set on Trump but undecided for the senate it seems much more likely they vote R in the end but split ticket.
1029,"Actually if you look at polling aggregators such as [rcp](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2022-generic-congressional-vote-7361.html), you can see that the polls were actually pretty close to the result in 2022. In fact, technically the polls were *under*-estimating the result."
1030,"It wasn't the polls, it was the pundits. Polls in 2022 with very accurate.


https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-election-polling-accuracy/"
1031,I know. I didn't say the polls would be more accurate just that you can't make such simple comparisons between them 
1032,"They did not say the same thing after 2016. After 2016 most pollsters believed they were under counting people without a college degree so they increased those samples but got other things wrong.

After 2020 they're just brute forcing it by adding more trumpers to the polls and shifting their weighting around.

I also didn't say the polls would  be more accurate I just said you can't directly compare them been cycles because the way they conduct and weight them changes every election. "
1033,">Don’t talk when you don’t know what you’re talking about. 

Aww, you been listening to alphas teaching you how to be a little big bad alpha? 

>They “refined” their model from 2016, and were even further off. 

You mean when they predicted a Biden win when Biden beat Trump?

>Sure bud, they will fix it this time.

Do you understand the concept of refinement?"
1034,We also can’t forget the abortion measure on the ballot in Arizona which is going to drive up democratic turnout. I’m happy Kari Lake might be hurting the state for Trump. It’s similar to NC where the republican candidate for governor is so bad it’s dragging Trump down.
1035,Any specifics as to what he's trending in by topic?
1036,"Trump wants to fuck his daughter, NEXT."
1037,Do you actually have any good reasons not to like Harris? Serious question.
1038,"True , especially with everything tying Kamala to Epstein and Ghislane Maxwell 

… oh wait nvm that’s her opponent"
1039,Sources.
1040,"My guy, you're voting for Epstein's buddy"
1041,Bruh how can you be against pedophiles yet *for* Trump? He's king pedo!
1042,At least they didn’t fuck his couch!
1043,Mark my words. Trump supporters will eat the dogs and cats to prove him right.

1047,Is nothing sacred!?
1048,HEY! I have guinea pigs and they are considered a delicacy in Peru.
1049,Go ahead… throw your vote away.
1050,"Exactly. As a D voter I would be more than happy to consider voting R if the Rs had candidates that were actually reasonable, but they don’t. I don’t like that I’m essentially forced to vote D every time because some D candidates are awful too, but there’s simply no viable alternative."
1051,I’ll be honest I didn’t even know if he went to college. He’s so dumb I kinda assumed he didn’t.
1052,Gladly.
1053,Plenty of morons up here in New York fyi.
1054,"Yep, I've got family exactly like that.  Some refuse to believe trump has been convicted for felonies because, ""If that was true, I'd have heard about it"".  I have no idea how to fix such willful ignorance."
1055,"If she wants to prevent a civil war, then that's all the more reason not to vote for the party actively pushing for one"
1056,Folks worried about civil war need to learn some history.
1057,"> Paxton is a fucking criminal

The US needs an AG that will deal with that"
1058,OMG you're not gonna believe this my dog ate 2 million voter registration forms ...
1059,"Texas: ""Oh man it's sooooo weird that there like two poling places each in Dallas, San Antonio, Houston, and Austin, and an abundance in towns like Cousin Kiss with a population of exactly two cousins who kiss each other and hate gays and immigrants."""

1061,"Welcome, friend.  Appreciate how thoughtful you're being with your views, words, and actions."
1062,"> I’m personally not FOR abortion, but I’m super not into telling women (or anyone really) what they should or shouldn’t do with their own bodies

You just described Pro Choice, my friend. 

How many people are thrilled for abortions? I doubt there are many. I hope abortion rates do decrease, but there are other means of making that happen (like education and access to free or low cost birth control). 

I personally wouldn’t get an abortion, but I support that choice being a decision between a woman and her doctors. It’s not my place or the government’s place to make that decision for someone else. That’s why it’s called pro-*choice*. The freedom to *choose for yourself* is what we support.

Thank you for sharing your story, it was encouraging to read."
1063,"Very glad to hear it, and I'm happy that you're voting to get the Trump stain off of America. I hope you're urging people in person, too - I think it maybe means more to some folks to hear the things you're saying coming from a former Trump supporter than from people who have been voting against him from the start. You could really make a difference with that!"
1064,I'm so glad you are seeing what we are seeing. Please share with your friends and encourage them to vote. Voices like yours are huge.
1065,Tell your friends!
1066,"Fellow Texan, it's heartening to hear your journey!

And can I get a FUCK GREG ABBOTT!?"
1067,"> but I'm super not for telling women (or anyone really) what they should or shouldn't do with their own bodies.

The idea that this isn't what pro-choice already means is honestly one of the biggest successes the GOP has made in the last 50 years. Pro-choice isn't about what you personally would do, it's about allowing others to make that decision for themselves."
1068,"It was blue (well, purple) 30 years ago. The governor and one Senator were Democrats. Obviously the House is trickier."
1069,"I think it's a mix of Republican shenanigans combined with Democrat apathy where a lot of people feel like ""it's Texas so of course it's red.,"" where if every single Democrat voted it would be a lot closer (minus point one about the shenanigans)."
1070,Yeah the transition is really slow but it’s getting there. To put it into perspective Bush won Texas in 2004 with 61% of the vote and Trump won Texas by 52% vs Bidens 46%. Texas is getting narrower every election barring a miracle it isn’t going blue this year but I am really curious to see the margin of Trumps victory this year because it’s going to give us a good indicator of where it’s going to be in 2028.
1071,They are trying to change the rules to statewide appointees must win a majority of countries instead of the number of votes to keep it red.
1072,"They hear it too, and keep destroying the election system and preventing votes from counting, overthrowing results, etc. Chances are it would probably be blue ALREADY if it ever had a fair election.  
  
But... they won't allow one of those."
1073,"Whoever said that was dumb, but it has been [trending more blue](https://www.270towin.com/states/Texas) since 2000. If the trend continues then it'll eventually be a battleground state, but obviously past performance doesn't predict future performance"
1074,I think I want to watch it all in real time so we can see our first woman president elected and that Former President ousted again.
1075,"Florida going blue seems possible (if unlikely) - but being called before midnight is pure fantasy.

If PA is called for Harris before midnight then I may go to bed early. If NC is called for her before midnight I'll be too excited to sleep. If it's FL that just means I'm already asleep and dreaming."
1076,Remember the red wave in '22? Yeah I don't either.
1077,Yes you're right. I forgot to account for the electoral college change after 2020. Back then Biden would have won without PA and GA but in 2024 it wouldn't be enough.
1078,"They predicted Biden would win by 6, Biden won by .5. In case you don’t realize this, the polls are actually projecting not the winner, but the % of votes each candidate will get. The winner is simply the obvious conclusion from that data.

Surely you know about margins of error, right? And surely you know that the results in Wisconsin were way outside of the margin of error. Meaning the polls were flat out not accurate to what happened, and have been disproven as factual data points."
1079,He said he might date her if she was NOT related. Never said anything about sex with her. NEXT.
1080,"Besides her flip flopping all of the time? Besides her calling Biden a racist, then accepting Vice Presidency? Besides that annoying af cackle? Besides she doesn’t have any policies of her own whatsoever?"
1081,And promptly I friended him when he found out he was hitting on a 14yo girl then banned him from Maralago. No flight log after that date either. Your argument is invalid.
1082,Joe Biden’s daughter and YouTube. 🤪🤡
1083,"You know he defriended him as soon as he found out he was hitting on a 14 yo, right? Banned him from Maralago too."
1084,Which kid did he mess with?
1085,"They didn't, but Vance sure did while the guy was distracted by the immigrants eating his dog."
1086,Already been fake calls to Springfield dispatch a accusing people of shit so the recorded calls can be uploaded as ragebait.
1087,"Its not possible to be a reasonable person and call yourself a republican. If someone finds they identify with ""fiscal conservatism"" (airquotes because their fiscally conservative policies are penny wise dollar foolish and usually only meant to promote some aspect of theocracy, racism, or class warfare), in the face of the current insanity and conspiracy theories of the republican party, the only way to get there is start advocating for a voting system that allows third parties to be viable, ranked choice voting or similar."
1088,"One of his professors said he was the stupidest person he's ever had in his class. I would assume he didn't physically go much, but the college did get paid."
1089,No no that makes too much sense. Should vote red to avoid the civil war from those suggesting it.
1090,They're not worried about the actual war.  They actively want that.  They're worried they're going to lose again.
1091,The US needs an AG that will deal with anything
1092,all these politicians think these skeletons wont come out of the closet one day but they will. And i hope the fbi is ruthless when it happens.
1093,So what I'm hearing is we need to bring in more illegals to eat the dogs before they can eat the voter registration forms.
1094,"As an old man, I've gone in halvsies on two abortions in my life.  (I'm 58 now.) Both were agonizing decisions. If I could go back in time and do it over again I would have avoided the need to do them, but I wouldn't stop them form happening.

No one *wants* to have an abortion. Any anti-abortion folks that say women are using abortions as a form of birth control are just plain making shit up."
1095,Yeah it is absolutely infuriating that Republicans have somehow successfully framed the rhetoric around the idea that pro choice people are actively trying to have as many abortions as possible.
1096,That was a leftover from the Dixiecrats of old.
1097,"I meant presidentially, but, yeah, that's fair."
1098,Do you think a Bush endorsement would turn the tide?
1099,"the margin will tell us to go for it in 2028 or 2032 because its too expensive to campaign here without any hope of actually winning. DFW, San Antonio, Houston, Austin, and El Paso are musts and you should probably still campaign in Amarillo, Lubbock, Odessa, and Corpus Christi."
1100,"Florida is usually called very early on election night.  They actually run a pretty polished election including precounting mail in ballots which many states do not allow.

The election won't be called on election night but I think the OP just meant Florida.  If FL were to go blue I think we all assume the race would be over."
1101,I remember it in Florida though.
1102,">>They predicted Biden would win … Biden won …

My point.

>In case you don’t realize this, the polls are actually projecting not the winner, but the % of votes each candidate will get. 

Aww, such a cute lil explainer! 

>The winner is simply the obvious conclusion from that data.

As I indicated above. 

>Surely you know about margins of error, right? 

What are those?

>And surely you know that the results in Wisconsin were way outside of the margin of error. 

Which ones?

>Meaning the polls were flat out not accurate to what happened, and have been disproven as factual data points.

What are you even arguing? Polls good, polls bad? Please recollect yourself and we can have a discussion when you’re ready."
1103,Yes something substantial please.
1104,"Trump Quote from 2002: “ I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it - Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”

On the younger side huh? He knew. The whole time. Just two rapist pedophile elites in a pod."
1105,Not a source. Post a source.

1107,"If your father gives the school a nice new building (or, the price of a nice new building), you get a piece of paper to hang on the wall.

1108,"And they would, miserably."
1109,And then we bring in snakes to eat the illegals and then apes to eat the snakes.
1110,"As a young man, banning abortion is making doctors in red and purple states fear punishment or backlash (should the purple state go red) and it is affecting the quality of healthcare women get because of hesitancy.

My wife had an abortion 7 months ago.  It was an ectopic pregnancy, a fertilized egg in the fallopian tube that is nonviable - if it gets too large the tube ruptures and you can die. Her doctors slowed everything down by not taking her seriously with her concerns it could be ectopic, delaying and delaying until it was almost too late.  FFS, the imaging technician informally gave us confirmation Saturday at 4am (10 hours in the ER because a wishy-washy OBGYN wasn't helpful or comforting earlier that day).  It took another 3 days for anyone else to agree it was ectopic...but when they did it was a rush for emergency surgery because of her fallopian tube had already ruptured.

She would have died because of the slow roll and pressure to minimize any abortive care that wasn't deemed necessary.  After all this, I learned the biggest donors to that hospital were Dr. Oz's billionaire in-laws who funded his GOP Senate campaign.  My wife's reproductive system is forever changed, an entire fallopian tube has been removed...and we're lucky it was just that.

We aren't baby murderers, we're happily pregnant again 7 months later.  My Christian nationalist cousins can fuck right off, and my parents are close behind for making excuses about them and Trump.

Abortion bans ruined women's health care ever more in America, so I have to speak for the dead or terrified women out there."
1111,"A Bush endorsement would likely turn any affirmed non voters (won't vote red, can't vote blue) to vote Harris and not just in Texas but anywhere there's moderate conservatives abhorred at the top of their ticket but just not ready to hold the nose and go with the other side."
1112,My assumption was just that if Dems win FL it will be by an extremely narrow margin - which is why I wouldn't expect it to be called early. Early calls usually indicate a healthy margin of victory - even in a well run state election.
1113,Florida is the Florida of the United States
1114,Moron. I’m talking about the average of polls. Not random polls that suite your narrative. You don’t know what you’re talking about.

1133,They changed Michigan to lean D and North Carolina and Georgia to toss-up.
1134,"Let’s be realistic folks. Trump got his butt handed to him at the debate because he let Kamala get to him. All he had to do was stay calm, and he couldn’t do it. Kamala was cool, calm and collected and made Trump look like a rabid dog. "
1135,No coconut tree is safe today
1136,Is he going to ask for Fox News to lose their license too 😂
1137,"TIL rather than report discouraging poll results, Fox News has “power rankings.”

And apparently even the power rankings can’t plausibly sell Trump at this point."
1138,"Oh boy…Trump just seems to be digging himself into a deeper and deeper hole.

Even though some polls show him ahead, other polls show him behind.

Will he just say, “I’m done, I don’t wanna do this anymore?”"

1141,"But but but according to Fox's own Waters, Trump easily is winning everywhere.

Unless...no.....why Jesse why we believe in you!"
1142,It’s insane that elections are treated like team sports to this degree. Fox News is a pile of shit but all of the media do stuff like this and it’s why so few Americans take election seriously or think about the actual issues and consequences. 
1143,Vote.
1144,Trumps gonna get so mad he poops in his dipey…twice. I wonder how much his diaper changer gets paid. Whatever it is it’s not enough…him standing there screaming and ranting and stomping his feet the whole time. And Looney Loomey thinks she’s got herself a prize….what a time to be alive.
1145,"The fact that they do power rankings is hilarious. I had no idea.

They're really leaning into the whole ""politics is just like team sports"" stuff."
1146,POWER ranking! Even the name of their candidate rankings are fascist.
1147,This sounds kind of like the equivalent of a Dick Cheney endorsement.
1148,This is fake news. I won the debate by all accounts everywhere in the world by a score of 86-3. Those three were KAHMAHLAH and those two so-called moderators that when I'm dictated for life will be the first ones thrown into the concentration camp. My concept of a plan is to deport 50 million illgal invaders on day one. On day two another 50 million. On day three another 50 million. By the end of the week only those people that I feel are my supporters will be left in the country.
1149,Polls mean nothing.  Look what happened with Hillary.
1150,Trump got absolutely destroyed. Harris kept baiting him and he fell for it every time. He could not stay on message. His closing statement was the most coherent rebuttal all night. But it was way too late. 
1151,"🎶Tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling dow-own.🎶"
1152,Nooo. Why did you have to ruin orange Fanta for me. 😫😫😫 That used to be my favorite growing up now I won’t be able to look at it without thinking of him. Why?! Why?!
1153,"He'll call for them to be fired, and if it was a woman, he'll call her nasty.  Then blame soros."
1154,I think he's moved on to imprisoning everyone he doesn't like at this point
1155,"Lets not forget that Bill Barr, the most corrupt AG this country has seen, flew to Fox “news” in 2020 and instructed the propaganda machine to stop being mean to king clown. That actually happened."
1156,"They'll also be called the ""lowest rated"" person on the show (whatever the fuck that means), and ""everybody has always known that they're the worst person on that network""."
1157,"She knocked him off balance when she entered his space and offered her hand, and he never recovered. She gave him the Reverse Uno Card, treating him like he treated Clinton in 2016."
1158,Bringing up his rallies was what really set him off. I think that pissed him off for the entire rest of the debate and it showed
1159,"The old evergreen observation/headline:  ""Trump Could Easily Have Succeeded at \[Basic Task\] If He Weren't Fundamentally Donald Trump"""
1160,"All he had to do during covid was listen to the experts.
He is incapable of not giving in to his contrary instincts."
1161,"And she's a fellow American who, in the larger scheme of things, is on the same side as him.

How can people believe he's capable of representing the country in the face of real adversaries like Iran and Russia? The guy can't debate his way out of a paper bag. His negotiation skills are garbage. Anyone can see that."
1162,"He got his butt handed to him because he didn’t prepare, reading and studying is not his game. There I are reports that he didn’t read the presidential daily briefing (pdb), can you the leader of the free world not being interested enough to read about the world? What about the safety ramifications for your country?"
1163,"> All he had to do was stay calm

I disagree. On top of not being calm, he very clearly had nothing of substance to deliver to people who may be undecided and actually care about various issues / policies.

Well, he had the concept of substance, I guess."
1164,"""made him look like a rabid dog""

Good thing the debate wasn't in Springfield!

/S"
1165,Yep. I wouldn’t put it past him to do so.
1166,Power rankings... for two candidates. Wtf
1167,"It was hilarious that he was sent in there with a strategy to tie Kamala Harris to Joe Biden, did nothing all debate to actually execute that, and then near the end had to try to think of some clever, subtle way to tie Harris to Biden: 

>She is Biden. She's trying to get away from Biden. I don't know the gentleman, she says. She is Biden.

Brilliant. Nailed it. Not unhinged at all."
1168,"The best part was her calling her shots in advance.

In the first few minutes, she called out that he would ignore every question and rant about immigrants, which he did, and then she called him out for how easy he is to manipulate, and then demonstrated it repeatedly."
1169,"And even then he had zero policy. Just ""Harris is bad"".

I love the shills/bots/MAGAts that say ""Harris only ever cries how she's not trump"", meanwhile, the closing statement from trump was literally ""Harris isn't me"""
1170,"To me, coherent or not, his closing statement was a true reflection of trump, all about fear. 

In fact, both candidates closing statements said a lot about their character. 

Kamala spoke to the American people directly, spoke about hope and positive things and trying to move forward together. 

Trump shouted at the moderators, never addressed the American people once, all about himself and about fear, fear about all the things that would go bad if she won. Two totally different messages and ultimately is everything you need to know about what kind of presidency they would lead"
1171,"And most importantly, that really highlighted/cemented the fact that he only cares about himself - 'he doesn't care about you.'"
1172,The best part is that the same tactic would work just as well in any subsequent debates. It's like Harris is playing a video game and found a way to cheese the final boss.
1173,"His main argument of why the election was “stolen” from him was that he had massive crowds compared to Biden.  It didn’t matter that they were super spreader events during COVID and most people tried to avoid any unnecessary risks and so did Biden, he was convinced that everyone was for him.

For her to mock his crowd size was to point out in his mind that he was going to lose and set his ego and narcissism off."
1174,You could see the very second he lost control. His facial expression was so telling. I feel like the rally comment was the one that knocked him off balance for the rest of the debate.
1175,questioning his friendship to Putin seemed like an even bigger hit lol
1176,"Yup. It's petty, stupid and immature 


But I'm loving the cope on the con sub it's hilarious "
1177,Can't teach an old fraud new tricks.
1178,"""Smithers, see how much for that rabid dog. I need something to hunt the slow with!"""
1179,"From the greatest hits:

""She is Biden. She's trying to get away from Biden. I don't know the gentleman, she says. She is Biden.""

""Puppet? No Puppet? You're the puppet""

and 

""Russia, Russia, Russia""

In all seriousness though - Isn't the way he says .... ""She is Biden. She's trying to get away from Biden. I don't know the gentleman, she says. She is Biden.""

The same way he tries to distance himself from the likes of Epstein and other bad actors?  
  
In my mind, he is basically saying ""She and Biden are one in the same, she's trying to distance herself from biden by saying ""I dont know the gentleman"" ""never met him"" etc, ""but in reality, SHE IS BIDEN"".

He is basically saying Kamala is lying to you, and the proof is because she says ""she doesnt know the gentleman""

Makes me think back to every video ever of trump saying he doesn't know X person, ""Never Met Him"", Etc. 

If KAMALA is JOE because she says things like that.  
  
Then by the same logic:  
Trump is everything he was accused of, in every instance he said ""I dont know the gentlemen"""
1180,"He had zero policy because he doesn't understand policy. He literally never has. 

Another example is his response to the healthcare question. He's obviously getting memed (rightly) for the ""concepts of a plan"" but notice in that answer how he also says they have ideas but doesn't elaborate and that his administration kept Obamacare but tried to make it better (which is a lie) but doesn't elaborate. It's because he doesn't even really understand what Obamacare is, what the alternatives might be, or anything related to the topic. 

He's never once put forth a specific policy proposal. He's too stupid to understand any policy positions. It's like asking a kindergartener to talk about policy."
1181,"Yup. Trump never learned to handle ego blows because he had the money and influence to never need to.


If there's another debate all harris has to do is go


""It's great to be here. Honestly a little surprised this happened considering my opponent kept telling his dwindling crowds at rallies there wasn't gonna be one. Their disappointment is probably why they left halfway through anyway *insert policy stuff*""


Trump won't let it slide and he'd explode the whole debate"
1182,the second he sucked the air through his teeth you knew he was about to go entire off script
1183,"Yup, that’s what stuck out to me immediately. He’s so narcissistic (and oblivious) he can’t help but believe everyone works just like him."
1184,"He spitballed using bleach and ""light under the skin"" live while addressing the American people regarding dealing with the pandemic. That's the opposite of a plan. So, what's new?"
1185,"Except kindergartens will ask what policy is and take the opportunity to learn.


Trump is much, much stupider than a kindergarten."

1187,Not a peep out of JD Vance. Gutless coward.
1188,How have we gotten to the point where one of the major political parties in this country is openly and blatantly spouting off racist propaganda?
1189,"Let Laura Loomer see you not caring about it. 

All the Harris campaign has to tweet back is ""Okay lol"" 
And she'll start raging. 

Then, after she goes on another tirade, reply with ""Wow... Okay lol"""
1190,She is a toxic individual. 
1191,"No, no, don't make big news of her yet, wait for October when she's in too deep!"
1192,"Stop letting sideshow freaks take attention away from the success of Harris' debate. I don't care if her face is so smooth makeup rolls off of it, she's a nobody."
1193,Loomer is a toxic piece of human waste
1194,"I can't help but think the point of her doing this now is to give Graham and MTG and others an opportunity to performatively disavow her, and pretend that they're better than that."
1195,"I can only hope the Indian-Americans who are offended by this, and sympathetic with Harris’ racial heritage, outnumber the Magats among them. It’s not a given."
1196,She's Trump's anger/hate translator.
1197,She is a traitor. American patriots do not act the way that she does. They serve their country or their community to make a difference and unite people. She’s a domestic terrorist. Treat her as such.
1198,Loomer is a true loon and perhaps is more delusional than Trump.

> The White House on Thursday condemned right-wing activist Laura Loomer for mocking Vice President Harris&#039;s Indian heritage.

> Loomer, a former congressional candidate, recently said on social media that if Harris wins the election, &quot;The White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center,&quot; among other comments.

> Greene and Loomer have since been in an intense back-and-forth on social platform X, with Loomer calling Greene a &quot;Raging antisemite&quot; and defending her initial post as a &quot;Funny joke about Kamala Harris&quot; using &quot;Her Indian mom as a way to dodge questions.""

1200,"Trump has embraced Loomer and she is an asset in his apparent effort to offend as many people as possible while asking for their vote.   He's running on the grievance, retribution, sneering, mocking, ridiculing and insulting platform.   How many swing/undecided/independent voters out there will be attracted to their incessant smears, which all sound like something a 6th grader would say.   Apologies to all 6th graders for the observation."
1201,All that said -- I'd prefer that the White House smelled like curry rather than Trump's diaper stank.
1202,I'm not really sure why people think this is bad for Trump. The reason most people I know are voting for him is because he is racist.
1203,"She'll be saying ""Deport Melania"" next."
1204,Also pretty foolish considering Texas and other states have sizeable Indian populations. 
1205,"Before my current home, the house I lived in had been previously owned by a sweet old Indian couple. For all the years I lived there, the cabinets did indeed hang onto the smell of their cooking spices.

And I tell you, it was *WONDERFUL.*

So yeah, not the burn she thinks it is. I'll be glad when the only thing Red in the White House is the curry."
1206,"I just read her Wikipedia page, and I'm....just...disgusted. I hope karma is a bitch for her. She's just filled with hate, and a pathetic excuse for a human being. No wonder Trump likes her so much."
1207,Well Kamala couldn’t say she was Indian shit could she
1208,She’s (Harris) not of Indian heritage?
1209,"Hate to say it, but if JD ends up a loser and divorced, the couches have won."
1210,"Fucking coward, none of these GOP assholes will protect their wives from MAGA.  None of them."
1211,"Yes but also I kinda suspect he’s waiting to see how the chips fall and if there’s an opportunity for him to replace Trump as the candidate, or at least run on his own in 2028"
1212,"The GOP has been racist for as long as many of us have been alive. The difference is *only* that this new breed doesn't feel like they need to use dog whistles and innuendo. 

See the now infamous Lee Atwater [quote](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/exclusive-lee-atwaters-infamous-1981-interview-southern-strategy/): (Note: the link doesn't censor the slurs.)

>*You start out in 1954 by saying, “Ni\*\*er, ni\*\*er, ni\*\*er.” By 1968 you can’t say “ni\*\*er”—that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.… “We want to cut this,” is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than “Ni\*\*er, ni\*\*er.”*

If you aren't aware, here's the first paragraph of Lee Atwater's Wikipedia entry:

>**Harvey LeRoy** ""**Lee**"" **Atwater** (February 27, 1951 – March 29, 1991) was an American political consultant and strategist for the Republican Party. He was an adviser to Republican U.S. presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush and chairman of the Republican National Committee. Atwater aroused controversy through his aggressive campaign tactics, especially the Southern strategy.

This has always been the GOP. If by some miracle they manage to survive Trump and tone down the rhetoric, it's important to remember that it's *just* the rhetoric being toned down-- not the philosophy."
1213,"Yeah, she loves rage baiting just like the other right wing extremists"
1214,"https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1834394095654985768
A nobody with unfettered access to the nominee. A nobody who was sent to parkland after the shooting and called the kids crisis actors when she worked for Alex Jones. This is dangerous, and makes Trump look somehow even more repulsive than he already was. Shine as big a spotlight on her as we can"
1215,I still don’t know who she is or what swamp she crawled out of
1216,"I had that thought as well.   It seems a bit performative.   As the tone shifts and his former enablers start running for the lifeboats to try and salvage some semblance of future relevance, we’ll see a lot of posturing and infighting while the old guard tries to pretend they never enabled a seditious venal buffoon.  

In my view there is no coming back for anyone who bent the knee to this man after J6.   They disqualified themselves from public service for life.

It couldn’t have been a more black and white character test and they failed massively."
1217,mushroom wrangler.
1218,Those poor sofas.
1219,Is there any way to cushion such a blow?
1220,He’s going to be waiting forever
1221,"Don't link me to her shit. Giving her attention gives her a platform, and I have zero plans on ever doing that."
1222,"And the Republicans only have themselves to blame for stupidly believing that by not convicting him he will disappear and not run again. Oh, how foolish they are."
1223,Truffle hunter.
1224,"She already has a platform; you remaining ignorant to her views doesn't affect that at all. She is advising the republican presidential candidate; it's probably a good idea to know her views on the topics.

Edit: Happy cake day!"
1225,"Well, I’m glad it was linked because I hadn’t seen it before"
1226,"They're just pointing out how she's not a nobody, she has direct and distinct access to Trump. 

Nobody here is distracted by her, and you digging your head in the sand to the danger she poses is not as productive as you may think."

1239,Think about PA and all of the MAGAs out there in the countryside- we are steeped in the exact same media and cultural environment. It is not in any way a freebie that we will vote a certain way simply because of one element of foreign policy.

We pretty much can't rely on the politics of original countries to infer those in new countries. It's like on average Jewish in US is more liberal than Jewish in Israel.

So the outreach is important."
1242,Most right wing government re funded by russia ye good luck winning election in poland lol
1243,"Speaking as someone who grew up in rural PA, and is polish-american: You need to also keep in mind that rural PA is rural PA for everyone who lives there. My local radio station made jokes comparing LGBT people to dogs growing up. People will complain, OUT LOUD, about black people being in the same waiting room as them. I worked retail and we had to ban someone from our store for constantly coming in and going on racial tirades at people. My own parents even came to embrace somewhat white supremacist thinking (for all of the usual reasons - easy way to feel better about yourself/included in the group). The culture/news environment is very, very right wing and lopsided. It's the same environment cranking out MAGAs from every other demographic. People in general are going to go with whatever they have been told and exposed to their whole lives - it is quite a scary thing to reject all of that and find your own way."
1244,">""But there is less agreement among them on whether Vice President Harris or Donald J. Trump would more effectively deal with Mr. Putin.""

What? Is it not obvious to everyone that Harris will stand up to Putin and Trump will bend over for him. Unless you are intentionally spreading Russian propaganda, of course."
1245,That sentence isn’t the opinion of the writer or NYT about Trump. It’s explaining that Polish Americans aren’t a monolith and many like Trump. 
1246,"Pierogi are easy. If she really wants to command respect, eat kishka!"
1247,How the fuck do they not know. Trump’s constitution was built on the principle of separation of NATO and pro-Putin.
1248,I have also seen this from a Ukrainian American woman married to a republican. She was so dismissive and said aid would come for Ukraine no matter who won. She didn’t want to hear the truth so I let it go

For people who speak any other Slavic language it's super easy. Most Ukrainians who escaped the invasion into Poland picked it up lightning fast."

1277,"I say this as a warning: do not get complacent. Reddit is a pro-Kamala bubble and if you are reading this, odds are very likely that you're unaware that a reliable poll came out today that puts Trump ahead in Michigan.

You're probably also not aware that all swing states not only are within the margin of error, but that polls STILL underestimate Trump's voters because historical polling doesn't reach his supporters. It is VERY likely that if the election were held today that Trump would win.

I want Harris to win, but everyone needs to absolutely vote as if their lives depend on it. We are down and don't even realize. VOTE."
1278,"Newsweek with the misleading headlines again:

>The two-day poll shows Harris leading Trump 47% to 42% among registered voters, a five-point lead. This is slightly higher than her four-point lead in the same poll from August 21-28. The margin of error in the Reuters survey was about three percentage points.

It's literally just a 1-point difference in a poll with a 3-point margin of error. The change is not distinguishable from noise."
1279,"So once the writing is really on the wall (and I expect a few more outrageous proclamation from Trump that will accelerate this), will MAGA sheepish accept the inevitable since he isn't in office and there isn't much they can do, or will they double down on vitriol and malice and make real trouble election night, like interfering with anyone that doesn't look like a Trump supporter?  Note: some is bound to happen, but how widespread?"
1280,The Voter Registration Resources link above is quite useful. Check it out if you are not yet registered to vote.
1281,Great news but just vote and then get as many others to vote.
1282,"Fire him again, America. Vote."
1283,">The two-day poll shows Harris leading Trump 47% to 42% among registered voters, a five-point lead. This is slightly higher than her four-point lead in the same poll from August 21-28."
1284,"""Breaking out with a lead"" sounds medically concerning.  /s"
1285,"Funniest clip from the spin room when DonOLD was spewing out numbers claiming he won: ""Where are you getting your numbers?"""
1286,She's the silver bullet.
1287,"I’m Australian and almost every single one of my friends that has spoken about this debate always comes to one conclusion, Harris Is relatable, she’s likeable, calm and collected... she’s all for the people of America. Trump however is unhinged, out of control and seeks power only for his and his wealthy billionaire mates to benefit. You’ll notice not once during the debate he spoke about doing anything for the people of America. Only attacking Harris and other bs."
1288,Doesn’t matter- go vote like she’s down
1289,Also down 1 in Michigan. I hope we start getting a flood of polls soon.
1290,"Next week, Trump leads by 2!"
1291,"Only someone doing propaganda quotes a meaningless number.

> While national polls provide a snapshot of voter sentiment, the outcome will ultimately be determined by the electoral college, with battleground states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Wisconsin playing a pivotal role."
1292,"People may downvote me for this and that’s fine. This debate was honestly a wash in both sides. It was just constant bashing and not actual discussion about policies. Trump going crazy about eating dogs and Kamala just avoiding actual responses to questions.. Futhermore, the debate was clearly biased towards Kamala objectively speaking. Call me Trump Supporter, White Supremacist, whatever.. idk words are words lol, but that fact is the that it was clearly biased. No fact checks against what Kamala for things that were right or wrong, but Trump only got fact checked for things that were consider “wrong”.. the implication of this that media can basically decide what is true or wrong. Other thing was there was no clarification on what Kamala was saying. When she was asked about the border.. she talked about being prosecutor.. doesn’t talk about her plan. When she was asked about her economic plan, she talked about being middle class… not relevant.  After 2020, I stopped caring about politics cause you either have people that fuck you over in public, people that fuck you over behind the scenes, and people that profit off of it."
1293,"It’s a cult of personality. When the figure head in a cult is removed the cult collapses. Moderate(ish) republicans who are voting for him just because they only ever vote republican will abandon him for losing two straight presidential elections. Evangelicals and white supremacists will still have their same views but their loyalty to Trump means it’s unlikely they’re going to take to another person. Doing so would probably make them feel like they’re betraying Trump. Even if Trump endorses someone else or tries to create a pseudo-monarchy with his family by passing it down to one of his sons, it just isn’t going to be the same. They’ve united around a person not an idea. So there is no backup plan."
1294,Let’s fire him again!

1299,"My girlfriend and I are writing postcards to send to Arizona.  We also are in a deep blue state in a deep blue district.

I don't know where she got the postcards and list of addresses...someone in the neighborhood noticed our ""Harris Walz Obviously"" yard sign and asked her if we wanted to help."
1300,"I live in a (very sadly) red state. I think one thing we all can do is use our personal social to engage in a very thoughtful/nonthreatening way with friends and family. Like I did a FB post about all the conservative Rs endorsing Harris and suggesting something must be really dangerous about Trump for Cheney and co. to support Harris.

I suggested people share it with fence sitters or people they know who need encouragement to get out and vote in swing states. Every little bit helps."
1301,"I am in New Jersey, which is quite secure, so car loads of us are driving to Pennsylvania to pitch in there. If you are within driving distance of a swing state, consider chipping in a weekend day to canvassing. That is the most direct way of influencing actual voters."
1302,I’m doing text banking for the Harris/Walt campaign and writing postcards to swing states. Anything we can do to GOTV will help! Look at down ballot races as well
1303,"I just donated to Angela Alsobrook who’s from Maryland and is running for senator, even though I live on the other side of the country. I listened to her on a podcast and she was talking about how close the race is in Maryland. She’s confident that this seat will determine who controls the senate. It’s a pretty important race."
1304,Hope it's big and sticks.  The Orange Menace must be extinguished to prevent his goons from stealing the election.

1310,Call PA and other swing state people to vote.
1311,I’m driving from NJ to PA to canvass a few weekends over the next few weeks.
1312,Yeah my state was a battleground state until Trump’s campaign decided there’s no hope for them here. Happy to contribute however I can.
1313,Get a list of people to vote for and share it everywhere.
1314,I tried phone banking and 90% were hang ups. A few cursed at me and nobody really engaged with actual conversation. It was demoralizing
1315,"I just had a thought of something, perhaps small, that ordinary people can do. Drive less. Buy less gasoline. If enough of us take the bus for a couple months, perhaps the price of fuel will remain low, which definitely would help."
1316,"Keep doing what you’re are doing and encourage others to do the same. We all should be spending less time here and more time volunteering. Voting is not enough. If you don’t have time, then donate money."
1317,yeah vote.
1318,And he will never change. And we do not want to go back to the chaos he sowed

1322,Blue wave his ass till he drowns in a sea of his narcissistic collapse.
1323,Who gives a shit if we crush his spirit? The fuck does that have to do with anything?
1324,This is a question I ask my friend every day. Neither of us can come up with an answer.
1325,"The people for Trump are living on carefully curated news -- I witness it with my mom. She comes away from conservative news reports with very little information and lots of outrage. In every situation she knows what to be upset about, but nothing about what went into it or why. They are absolutely convinced, by reports from the right, that everything the Democrats do is sneaky and evil and they want to destroy Christianity, they want to destroy the free market, destroy white dominance, destroy the ""natural place"" for women and men, and a dozen other things that mostly come down to fear of change."
1326,They are convinced that anything negative about Trump is a liberal media deep state plot to take their freedoms.
1327,"They believe the felonies are trumped up charges achieved with legal gymnastics, the insurrection wasn't his fault, and they genuinely don't care about the rape. It's all about what they believe he'll do for America, nothing else matters"
1328,"Yep, but we gotta deal with the other heads flailing around a little bit before they go away(violence/election fuckery). So gotta stay vigilant the rest of our lives and hope it’s a distant memory for our kids."
1329,"You are wrong about maga disappearing without trump, what do you think the tea party fascist movement was…"
1330,"True. But the 70 million people that support him will still be walking around, seething that Harris is in the Whitehouse, waiting and looking for their chance to continue shitting on your country. This will never be over. It is the eternal battle to move humanity forward."
1331,Unless he performed another coup
1332,"I wish I was as optimistic as that. Unfortunately this whole maga schtick isn't just Trump - around WW 2 there was an America first anti immigrant racist ideology which he has borrowed a ton from tactics from by the way, and that ideology has been kept alive and is now in the DNA of the modern day Republican party. When Trump is defeated, they'll find and stand another clown to take his place and 45% of Americans will gladly vote for him."
1333,And her “lie” was because Trump has lied about his connections to project 2025.  How is something a lie if the verification of the statement is based on a lie?
1334,"did you hear him ramble off a bunch of numbers and expected people to believe these are actual poll number.. ""we won 94 to 6, 84, 13, 64.. lots of numbers, good results. Probably my best debate ever!"" He's such a fucking clown."
1335,"It’s unlikely he could win a debate, though, up against the skilled prosecutor Harris is. It’s not good for him either way, and that’s the way I like it."
1336,Kinda doubt he’ll put his hand up for that level of humiliation again.
1337,"On the other hand, Trump himself has noted that he really doesn’t want to do another debate and is refusing to do so, despite all the pressure around him."
1338,It’s an awesome project. Thank you. My 73 year old mother is up to 750 postcards. I’m amazed.
1339,"No one is trying to get people to not vote. If you don’t care about polling, maybe the subreddit devoted to politics isn’t the best place for you. Maybe consider one devoted to voting?"
1340,"We know that. We’re not being complacent. 

But at the same time, MAGA themselves seem to be digging themselves into a deeper and deeper hole."
1341,"Insider Advantage is not a reliable pollster. You're huffing some weird crap if you seriously believe they are. They have a very strong conservative bias and are one of the pollsters responsible in 2022 for flooding States with polls showing a red wave. 

So if you claim they're reliable then you must also believe Rasmussen is reliable as well. Which no they're not. Neither is Trafalgar for that matter. If you see polls from those three pollsters it's best to ignore their results or add +3 Dem to them to begin to get maybe a kinda accurate picture of the actual state of things."
1342,"""I was going to vote for Harris but I saw on Reddit that she is winning so I decided not to vote"" - nobody."
1343,Agreed. I see people talking about a landslide and they are completely out of touch with reality.
1344,I thought they were implying she was showing up with a Tommy gun.
1345,It’s not a meaningless number. Even your quote says it’s a snapshot of voter sentiment.
1346,"Okay, yes, I downvoted you after reading “this debate was a wash for both sides”. And then I read the rest of your comment and it just got worse and worse, to be really honest with you. Trump *literally* literally got the last word on every single question, half of which were because he bullied his way past the moderators and they unmuted his mic. The *only* time Kamala tried to get an extra word in, she was yelled over repeatedly—several times more than any attempt against Trump—and she was not allowed any more time. Trump had 5 minutes more of speaking time. Trump was fact checked more than Kamala because he lied 33 times and she “lied” once. To call it unfair in Kamala’s favor is just disappointingly misguided and malinformed. Do you want the media to just… make shit up to pretend the lie count was even when it wasn’t? Because it wasn’t. This isn’t some masturbatory centrist jerk off fantasy where everything is exactly even and if it isn’t then it’s clearly biased. Trump is just objectively a liar and Kamala objectively isn’t, or at least wasn’t during the debate. All of human knowledge exists at your fingertips. You can do your own fact checking. You haven’t, but you can.

I want someone to just be fully honest with you. You need to adjust your perception and be able to realize when people are just absolutely full of shit compulsive liars, because the fact that you couldn’t tell the difference and felt that *Trump* was disadvantaged by anyone but himself during that debate is concerning and honestly worrying. If you’re going to be this unattuned to politics, current events, and readily apparent misinformation, then I’d rather you continue to be disconnected from political engagement than actively harming it. Thank you."
1347,"Trump lied 33 times, and was fact checked three times about things that were both grossly wrong, but also dangerous with regards to the blatant racism against an immigrant community as witnessed by the events since then.

Harris on the other have, lied once, excluded important context a few times, and mislead twice.

Those are hardly comparable. If Harris had kept up with Trump’s lies, or had incited people the way that Trump did, I am confident that the moderators would have done the same to her.

If one side is cheating in a game, fair refs are going to throw more flags against that side. That’s not bias, that’s just being a good referee."
1348,"Okay, others have already covered the rest of what you said, but why the fuck are you here if you stopped caring about politics?"
1349,But you’re forgetting one important detail —Trump has a concept of a backup plan
1350,"The cult may collapse, but they will still vote for the next Republican. People take pride in calling themselves life-long Rs or Ds.  Nothing will change unless we have ranked choice voting and getting rid of the electoral college.  And also fast and hard prosecution for spreading misinformation"
1351,"I agree there is no replacement once he’s gone. But there will be someone in the future who saw what Trump was able to get away with and approach the same goals of destroying democracy in a much more strategic and cunning way. Like obviously Republicans have been trying to do that for decades via the courts, voter suppression, etc but Trump showed them they can just try to smash and grab power and the electorate won’t punish them at all for it and it remains to be seen if the law even will. If you can try to steal an election and then be eligible to run in the next one, you’ve basically already shattered the perception of punishment for trying to just outright steal an election in the open.

  
2000 also taught them that liberals will just accept a stolen election if you put it through the official channels. Honestly I’ll be shocked if they don’t try to refuse to certify certain states on claims of voter fraud and the SCOTUS will make some decision to help Republicans and it eventually ends up being decided in Congress where the Republicans have the numbers to “legitimately” install Trump."
1352,"This just isn't true.  Mao died in 1976 and the CCP is still around.  Lenin died in 1924, and the Soviet Union didn't dissolve until 1991.  Caesar died in 44 BC, Augustus in 14 AD if you want to pretend the Republic was still around post Julius; yet republicanism stayed dead thereafter.

This trend toward authoritarianism isn't going to end with Trump.  It's very likely a single party state is inevitable so long as Fox News exists.  Fox News, the Heritage Foundation, The Federalist Society, they all have made it very clear their intent to bring about the death of the American Republic, they are now openly calling for founding an autocratic state.  The anti American movement needs to be stamped out; how things are right now when Trump dies someone else will just pick up the fascis and run with it.  Mango is just a symptom, he his not the disease."
1353," Yeah, it sounds like people need to be a bit more engaged and active if they want change. Just voting isn’t enough; getting involved in local politics or helping out with campaigns seems to be crucial. Reducing complacency and actually taking part in these processes is the way to go."
1354,Don’t forget school boards.
1355,"Seconding this.

1357,You can still volunteer even if you're not American
1358,Brilliant!
1359,I signed up to do postcards back in August! They’re so backed up with volunteers they said it would be 5 weeks to get materials sent to me. I still haven’t received them.
1360,Is there any text banking left? I can easily do that and did it last time and would want to again but can't find any open spots.
1361,"As far as I’ve seen, there’s multiple text campaigns every day. You have to take a 45 min or so training, take an easy test and get a discord account (everything is run on discord). Then you’re good to go! You should be able to find the zoom training sessions (there are multiple days/times), on the Harris/walz campaign website under take action. Good luck! It’s actually a lot of fun so far!"
1362,"As in, traveling to another state to canvass?"
1363,Experience has been similar. However I worked a few sales jobs in the past and the rule I always heard was 3% is GOOD. So I was sort of used to the overwhelming rejection.
1364,"Let’s be real. There’s a clear adult in the room. The other is a fucking maniac. And I don’t have to tell you which is which. The mere fact that we are this close of a race, we should fucking be ashamed of ourselves as a nation."
1365,"Fuck him, that’s why."
1366,Give the GOP a clear message to move on and get reasonable.  Give the DOJ and all the state attorneys general and judges that have cases against him a signal that he's done and he can be convicted and sentenced without him looking like a martyr.  Make things like abortion and lgbtq+ issues a third rail.  Give racists and misogynists and homo and transphobes a signal that their bigotry won't fly and they'll have to behave and participate in a more equal society.
1367,"So he'll fucking go away forever! Send him to Gitmo, damnit. Do not want to hear from that traitor again."
1368,"After this last decade of bullshit, it's pretty damn personal, and I think a lot of people would love to see him miserable."
1369,"I used to feel that way. Now, I hope they call him “Trump, King of Siberia.”"
1370,"Enough people are willing to look past those offenses because 1. he hates the same people they hate, and as long as the ‘right people’ get “dealt with”, they’ll vote for him.; and/or 2. Many, if not most, of his supporters submit to his authority like good little followers, believing in what he says as if it were the gospel truth (e.g., that he’ll lower their taxes, despite evidence that he’s never done so in the past), and they wouldn’t dream of questioning the authority figure (classic RWA).

It’s not a mystery why half of the country will vote for him.

Half! HALF of the country.

May we all let that sink in."
1371,Bingo. For those folks it's not politics and public service any more. It's a team sport and they live in a reality that says the other side is out to get us all.
1372,Deranged fucks. Deport them all.
1373,I'm afraid you are right.  It will reappear as the same vile fascistic mob under another name.
1374,"it won't go away, but without the Trump cult of personality, hopefully a lot of the people who were low interest, low engagement in politics will fade back into the realm of non-voters"
1375,"Let's call a spade a spade... The fucking networks have to appear impartial so they had to grasp at straws to find something they can say she lied about, because Donald Trump lied 33 times."
1376,"No it's because she said ""bloodbath"", which was taken out of context. The quote she meant to reference said ""bloody"""
1377,He is a predator -- he feeds on people's weakness and revels in their humiliation. If he truly believes he won he would be begging KH to debate again.
1378,"Yeah I don't get why he wouldn't go with ""believable"" numbers. Something like 55 to 60 percent. He needs to have the bigliest numbers, numbers like no one has ever seen before lmao"
1379,You are right. He ALWAYS makes sense and NEVER changes his mind.
1380,"These posts are all that Reddit is upvoting and while they may be comforting, they may not be helpful. We are in an echo chamber. People should absolutely be uncomfortable and worried."
1381,It absolutely should be taken seriously. I would rather over prepare than under prepare and everyone should be operating under the assumption that we are losing and need to make up ground.
1382,"You can fact check things but who is regulating the fact checking during a debate? If there is no non partial source stance to evaluate the facts at hand, then what’s a point of a fact check? And while we have access to world, it doesn’t mean information is always correct. For example, when Trump was talking about people eating pets, that was complete bullshit. Again this happens all the time on Republican networks and Democratic networks all the time.. I’m sure if Fox News did a debate, we would see something similar. And majority of times Trump was cutting off was mainly due to him taking the bait on things like his rallies are boring or responding which I personally think was a waste of time to respond to to whatever Kamala mentioned about him in particular in terms of policy.. in a debate, I feel that’s normal. If someone says something you disagree with, you have a rebuttal. That’s how debates should go instead of letting someone attack and go on to next question.  At the end of the day, I feel this wasn’t a debate. It was just theater. If you have a preconception of who you are going to vote for, then you are gonna call one a liar and one who isn’t rather than listen to both sides and evaluate both. The problem with today is that we have become so divided at point where so called “political engagement” is stating one side is good and one side is bad.. there isn’t a sense of civil discourse."
1383,[deleted]
1384,"I don’t really care about politics, but I still like to learn and understand what happens around me. Even though I know whoever comes into office isn’t going to drastically change my life for the better or the worst, I like learning about things and observing"
1385,Aw we’re fucked
1386,"But none of those things can happen from the federal government without a constitutional amendment. And that's never going to happen. You have to work with the system you have, not the system that you want"
1387,The part you’re missing here is that they were all leaders when they died. Trump isn’t the leader now. How many memorable historical figures were there that failed to become the ruler twice in a row? There’s likely a whole load more of them that you simply can’t name because no one remembered them after their losses because they never rose to the same fame as the ones you named. Which is precisely the previous poster’s point. Support for Trump will fracture and his name will drift off in to boring history.
1388,You literally ignored the entire crux of my argument. The core of those movements were communism. Not mao and Lenin.
1389,"School boards are arguably the most important offices in the country. Childhood indoctrination is how you get MAGA. You gotta intercept them while they're still children to make sure that they grow into normal, well adjusted adults who don't need the government to bully people for them."
1390,And judges!
1391,"I’m not sure that’s allowed, is it?"
1392,"Depending on the state, it’s possible. Being in Chicago, I’ve traveled up to Wisconsin and Michigan to canvass"
1393,Have to fund and repair public education ASAP.
1394,"Well, yeah, America shouldn’t have put that ficker in office in the first place.

And, I was being excited, there’s definitely not going to be a landslide with the maga cult hanging around. 

But we should get as close to a landslide as possible under the circumstances. 

[It’s the only way to be sure.](https://youtu.be/aCbfMkh940Q?si=Wp5MnnqrVhqM6MBE)"
1395,I am
1396,"And if we crush Trump but he stays in good spirits, then we succeed in none of this?"
1397,"It's like a third, but it's enough to be very scary."
1398,Plus hopefully a big nasty fight over who will become the new leader that eats up all the resources and energy of the right-wingers.
1399,"ABC put “needs context” on the 2025 claim.
>Harris claims Trump “intends on implementing” the “detailed and dangerous” plan if he wins a second term. But Trump denies any association with Project 2025, saying on social media in July: “I have not seen it, have no idea who is in charge of it,” and also publicly denounced its substance as “seriously extreme” and developed by the “severe right.”

https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Politics/fact-checking-kamala-harris-donald-trumps-1st-presidential/story?id=113567997"
1400,"More like, he's weak and mentally feeble, can't actually argue with anyone firing on all cylinders :P"
1401,"Yup, just like he did against Biden. They know they looked good (only in comparison to a severely diminished Biden), so they offered to do several more debates. Oh how the turn tables."
1402,"It’s all the hyperbole grandiosity of a narcissism. It’s why when he says something it’s always “nobody thought it was possible”, or “nobody/everyone wanted that” or “double/quadruple” or “worst/best there’s ever been”

It’s how you can easily spot a narcissism. Everything is a hyperbole in their favor"
1403,"You can while being well aware of the fact that bad faith pollsters exist. Insider Advantage, Rasmussen, and Trafalgar are just that. They're pollsters who are insanely partisan and put out skewed results. Their data is meant to create noise, and it's frustrating seeing people cry when their polls come out showing the orange turd further ahead than other polls are showing."
1404,"Look regardless of whether you think this was a debate or not, the thing showed just how easy it is to manipulate Trump.

Do you really want someone so gullible to negotiate with competent world leaders? Do you really think that would turn out well for America?"
1405,"So there is no objective truth? Because that’s what you’re saying.

With the dog-eating shit, they literally said where the information came from. ABC news talked the city manager. Learn to listen."
1406,"Trumpism will die but the widespread racism, bigotry, hate and ignorance which made him popular will still be there. That's going to be much more difficult to fix."
1407,"And the core of what is happening in the United States is fascism, not Trump."
1408,Yes it is. Volunteering is completely allowed especially if you're in the USA but I'm sure you could probably do texts from Canada also or something.
1409,"As a teacher (who agrees public education needs the funding), that is number two on the docket. Number one is overturning Citizens United. Everything else pales in comparison."
1410,People just need to vote. We are a democracy and if we intend to keep it then let’s show the fascists how it works here.
1411,"If polls are any metric, almost half of the country would vote for DT. That’s from where I’m getting my stat."
1412,"It's not even a lie, it's at best unverified.


More proof that he plans on implementing it like all the connections he has with the people he's hired + more, than evidence he won't (he pinky swears he won't)."
1413,Bingo. That alone demonstrates he is unfit for any position of responsibility.  One of maybe 100 things that each should disqualify him alone but hey ho.
1414,"There are some claims that don’t make sense clearly but there are some where I feel the truth isn’t necessarily objective. I saw a fact check that popped up about 2025. The fact check was that Trump’s old colleagues were involved in it.. so Trump is involved. But that opens up arguments to be made rather than a conclusion. Just because your old colleagues believe in something, do you have to? If you read entire novel, do you have to agree to every page stated?"
1415,There are some claims with the right source it makes sense to say that it is inaccurate. Trump making that dog eating claim was baseless and dumb. The whole story of that came from a Facebook post from nobody.. again not a great source for Trump to pull from
1416,That’s what I’m saying. The dog eating stuff was not a good claim to make. I read about that and it Trump claiming that is not accurate.
1417,"Agreed. I was thinking about that this morning. I feel like the problem is that people have been skewed by seeing some bad acts by some minorities and now they’re being led to believe all minorities are bad and need to go.

But what I was pondering this morning is that ALL cultures have bad people. Black, white, Muslim, Mexican or whatever. And all cultures have way more good people. But often the bad ones are the loudest and give the good ones a bad name. We should actually be trying to ensure society is built upon the shoulders of all the good people from every culture and encourage each culture to rat out the bad eggs and shame them.

But instead, at the moment, the bad ones seem to gain the biggest voice, which just leads to resentment and mistrust. If we want to solve this issue we need to understand that it’s actually a battle of good vs bad, not culture vs culture. Too many people are swayed by the culture argument and forget about the good vs bad."
1418,It’s fascism because Trump is a fascist…you’re a leftist aren’t you
1419,"That doesn’t sound right to me. Obviously there are non-Americans trying to influence the election but I don’t think it’s surely at least frowned upon, and I would’ve thought illegal. Are you sure?"
1420,Narrator: They are not.
1421,"Did you see that fact check during the debate, from the moderators?

Because the premise of your statement was that it was biased in Harris’ favor. If you’re watching something after the fact, or other than what was on the ABC feed, you’re not talking about the actual debate. 

I do not remember my feed having that information."
1422,"And because it was fact-checked, people could choose not to be misled by misinformation. 

It was not “a bad argument,” as your aaid, it was a racist lie that should have been curb-stomped, just as it was.

Your trying to soften it into “a bad argument” tells me everything I need to know."
1423,"I agree 100 percent. There needs to be a shift away from the thinking of prior decades where we thought we could count on 'civility' and pretend that all people in the 'market place of ideas' are acting in food faith. 

We need to understand that racism can permeate without the overt behavior we would associate with our culture 50+ years ago. Information simply moves too quickly and is amplified too much for us to continue operating under pre-internet assumptions of good intent. As you say, not culture vs culture, but good vs bad, progressive vs reactionary.

A lot of people are starting to say and do things that they would have been ashamed of 20 years ago. They see videos and articles on the Internet or local news and feel it justifies the bigotry they felt in their heart but kept hidden for so long."
1424,Trump is just a symptom. American fascism isn't going away because Trump loses an election.
1425,"Foreign nationals can volunteer for campaigns, but cannot make decisions about how campaigns are run nor contribute money to campaigns.

1426,"They are snapshots in time, to be sure, but my point still stands: *At this moment in time*, randomly-sampled polling suggests about half of the country would for DT if the election was today."
1427,"American fascism was always here but it was empowered by trump. Sure you wanna tell me Bobby Joe from bumfuck Alabama would like to overthrow the government in place of a theocracy, fine. But the practical effectiveness of the fascist movement in America won’t be at a substantive level to influence politics. I really don’t care about anything else tbh."
1428,Wow that’s amazing. Thanks.
1429,"Trump was merely an instrument that Fascists have used to acquire power. The fact that you think that Bobby Joe from Bumfuck Alabama is the threat, and not the billionaires funding the Heritage Foundation, is adequate to prove that you don't have a clue what is happening in this country."

1431,"""Kamala's Coconut Jubilee"" for those who just want the name."
1432,"This story actually is better than the headline:

> For the next month, the ice cream truck tour will make stops in more than 20 cities in battleground states and hold four additional rallies: in Ann Arbor, Mich., on Sept. 28; in Madison, Wis., on Oct. 5; in Phoenix on Oct. 10; and in Las Vegas on Oct. 16.

> During each stop, the organizers will distribute free ice cream and giveaways and help people make a plan to vote by Nov. 5. The MoveOn press release said there will be “special guests,” including elected officials and activists, who will also stop by on the tour."
1433,The Trump flavor will be called Transgender Operations On Illegal Aliens in Jail and will be full of bologna
1434,Caramela Harris was right there
1435,"Because the American right cries about ""both sides"" all the time, they will also be releasing a Donald Trump ice cream flavour. 

It's orange, tastes like bitterness and ketchup, and smells like a soiled diaper."
1436,"> Ben & Jerry’s co-founders, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, are unveiling a new ice cream flavor, “Kamala’s Coconut Jubilee,” as part of a get-out-the-vote initiative to elect Vice President Harris and other downballot Democrats in November.
> 
> Cohen and Greenfield will join progressive organization MoveOn Political Action for its “Scoop the Vote” ice cream truck tour, which kicks off in Philadelphia on Sept. 16, the same day early voting begins in Pennsylvania.”

Lol:
> Other election-themed ice cream flavors will be available at the ice cream truck stop, including, “Unburdened by What has Vanilla Bean,” “Inauguration Celebration Birthday Cake,” “Fight for Our Rights Sorbet” and “MoveOn Mobilizer Milk Chocolate.”"
1437,"Damn, I wish I didn’t hate coconut 😞"
1438,"She has my vote, but man, I hate coconut."
1439,What no Trumpster Dumpster? Fresh white vanilla with hamberder and covefe sprinkles.
1440,"This can’t be true, you think I just fell out of a coconut tree? 😂"
1441,"The Trump version has all the most amazing superlatives on the outside, but would be completely empty."
1442,Tastes like freedom and competence
1443,"Dear Maga Supporters,

Do not eat this ice cream, please. It'll have a ""witchcraft"" potion to make you fall in love with Kamala and vote for her.

But by all means, you should definitely join a Trump rally to see how lame and boring it is. In god we trust."
1444,"Cool.

Real shame that Ben Cohen has in the past had a real bad habit of parroting russian talking points [and blaming the US/NATO for russias invasion of Ukraine.](https://www.politico.eu/article/ben-cohen-ukraine-war-russia-blames-america-ben-and-jerrys/)"
1445,"In fairness, they should create an orange chicken flavor for Trump too."
1446,"I dig Kamala, I dig Ben & Jerry’s, but I effing hate coconut 😭"
1447,Fuck Ben & Jerry's for their disgusting comments on the Ukraine war.
1448,"Cool, but fuck Ben & Jerry's.

I'll never forgive them for funding a campaign against aid for Ukraine at the onset of Putin's invasion. As Russia began to ravage Ukraine, and atrocities like those seen in Bucha and Irpin were taking place, instead of joining in solidarity against Putin they bought into Russian propaganda and claimed NATO was to blame. They fought against aid, and pushed the insane theory that not supporting Ukraine would bring peace. 

Of course, as we've seen time and time again in occupied territories, when Ukraine loses territory to Russia it does not bring peace. It brings subjugation, torture, rape, murder, and destruction of their culture—genocide."
1449,They also introduced the concept of a Donald Trump flavor
1450,Standby for creepy Elon Musk comment
1451,The trump flavor is lard with diarrhea flecks.
1452,I don’t like coconut but they did it for the meme and I respect it 🥥🌴
1453,"Looking forward to  their next flavor, Trump Chump, but first it needs a flavor.  Prunes  suspended in a bile gelato is a hard sell.   What would be better?"
1454,They should have made a flavor called “Pet Peeve”  and has little cat and dog chocolates in it
1455,Trump flavour would be “Cats and Dogs”
1456,How long before the right wingnuts buy stacks of the stuff then burn or shoot it for tiktok?
1457,Hard to lose with B&J on your side!
1458,Fun little story about Kamala and the top comment is about trump. What is you doin' baby? Leave him in the dustbin of history where he belongs.
1459,Oh yeah Ben & Jerry’s.  Give my fat ass more reasons to eat you.
1460,Should be called “Gutted a clown on live TV”
1461,Coconuts are a common ingredient in Indian cuisine.. Excellent!
1462,"Welp, there goes my waistline."
1463,"liberals about to get themed foods back, for some reason Biden never got a food "
1464,"Get ready for ice cream bonfires to own the libs! Yokels will be buying out entire freezer sections just to set them on fire.

You might say, ""but it's ice cream. It's probably going to melt and put out the fire, if one can even catch at all in the first place!"", and to that I say don't you want videos of morons trying to set ice cream on fire? Because it's probably coming."
1465,That made me smile.
1466,Owned by Unilever
1467,What about something that's a nod to her mixed Jamaican and Indian heritage? I came up with a rum and cardamom flavor: Kamala CardaRum.
1468,Now do Trump and have it be shit flavored lmfao
1469,What would a trump flavour taste like????
1470,"Goddammit, another flavor to add to my ever-growing list.

- Gimme S’More!
- Minter Wonderland
- Milk & Cookies
- Half Baked
- The Tonight Dough
- Change Is Brewing
- Dublin Mudslide

- Chocolate Fudge Brownie 
- Strawberry Shortcake 
- Pumpkin Cheesecake 
- Chewy Gooey Cookie"
1471,They forgot to add dorito crumbs
1472,Thank God they’re not offering equal time.  My mind is reeling with what Donald Trump ice cream would be.
1473,"please tell them to stop. ben & jerry's is literally the kiss of death. If they want to help, STFU."
1474,"Predicting it now: Trump will demand that B&J name a flavor after him or else accuse them of ""election interference.""

I saw a prank show once where they made a shit flavored ice cream and sold it in an ice cream shop just to see if people would try it. They did. That's the staring point for the Trump flavor, just color it orange. ""Orange Dump."""
1475,"Does donald with a little d Trump's taste like Dog? RFK's taste like Whale, or maybe Bear? Vance...Whatever makes sense? Leon's taste like a pile of Shit? Inquiring minds want to know."
1476,"Oooh, I love coconut! I am so buying this!"
1477,"I'll be expecting a horde of salty MAGAs to head out to their respective local supermarkets to destroy the ice cream isles the moment a Kamala-based varietybhits the shelves.  


That, or they'll do the other tired, cringey thing where they buy a whole bunch of pints, set them out in a field, and record themselves turning around to the camera and saying something dumb thing like ""hEy kAMaLa, thiS iS *My* fAvoRiTe FLaVoR.  IT's cALlEd ""KiSs mY ASs!!!"" before using the pints for target practice."
1478,Psh. In the Bay Area we’ve had a Kamala ice cream since she first attempted to run for president
1479,I’d rather try their new Trump flavor: Kitty Quiche. 
1480,I know there’s a cherry joke in here somewhere
1481,"They need to give Trump his own flavor, just to be fair. I vote ""Crushed Orange Panic""."
1482,In before Magat’s “nEvEr LiKeD bEn AnD JeRrY’s AnYwAyS”
1483,"It sounds like you can only get it at truck stops in battleground states....

I want ice cream too"
1484,"Hate coconut, but that’s pretty fucking cool"
1485,Meanwhile Pampers introduces trump diapers.
1486,"In fairness, they should do a Trump flavor. Maybe call it “Crumpleneck Trumpycrumb Rocky Road.” The flavor is just dog shit packed into pint containers."
1487,imagine how two-scoops donnie feels about that
1488,"What would a Trump flavor be?

Orange Bullshit?"
1489,"They rock! But it’s got coconut, so I’m out."
1490,They going to come out with a Trump flavor? I imagine it’d be gross like big Mac flavored. They just take a whole Big Mac with extra sauce extra onion and blend it into plain vanilla ice cream
1491,But I saw an idiot on Twitter lecturing someone about how the coconut meme is racist.
1492,That's great... but I hate coconut.
1493,"I wonder if Joe Biden will eat the Harris ice cream, he loves ice cream 😂"
1494,"IDK if Trump has s flavor, but I imagine it's very sour and salty."
1495,"My question is, will there be the disgusting shredded coconut in it?"
1496,"I've never heard of this coconut tree= Kamala or Dem meme.

They really just skipped over any caramel names?  I'm guessing cause they already have 50 caramel flavors and need something else."
1497,"When are they releasing their Trump inspired ""Orange Turdle"" ice cream for his MAGA fans to eat up?"
1498,The celebrity flavors peaked with Cherry Garcia and Phish Food
1499,JD Vance “Cats N’ Couch” will be next
1500,"How long before Trump puts out his own ice cream?

Probably orange sherbert."
1501,How long until Babylon Bee has a “joke” about them being unsure whether to make it a flavour associated with either one of her heritages.
1502,I can’t remember did they ever do a trump flavor?
1503,They need to make a trump flavor. Pralines and dick with a touch of orange would be good for him.
1504,Ben & Jerry's pints full of bullet holes incoming.
1505,Cue a bunch of conservatives yelling Go WoKE gO BRoKe
1506,"Is the ""go woke, go broke"" squad on this yet?"
1507,Am I correct in assuming that they will come out with a “Pet Flavoure” in honour of Trump?
1508,Ummm...  I don't want human tasting ice cream...
1509,"Me: It better be a Caramel pun, like Karamala Krunch or something

>Kamala’s Coconut Jubilee

Well that's lame."
1510,When will they give the land back to the indigenous that they’re on?
1511,"Can’t ever forgive them for supporting Russias war in Ukraine.

Fuck those guys."
1512,I heard they’re also working on a pet-flavored ice cream named Orange Turd-a-Licious Extravaganza
1513,Are they still against the USA supplying weapons to Ukraine so they can defend themselves?
1514,"Gotta love Ben and Jerry. And they're not just creating a flavor, they're doing a whole event to get voters to register in swing states and vote. Thank you Ben and Jerry!"
1515,Glad they found time to create a new favor in-between fellating Putin.
1516,"Cringe. 

Corporations do not care about you or the world. They only do things like this to sell more of their product."
1517,They did her so dirty with that pic 😂
1518,Cat flavor.
1519,[deleted]
1520,"Where’s the Trump flavor that tastes like cats, dogs and spray tan?"
1521,"That actually sounds like a decent flavor, I’d like to try. I wonder if they’ll carry it in Publix in Florida?      
       
I bet if a bunch of people request it, they will.  www.publix.com"
1522,Oh fuck... Game over man
1523,Slightly nutty with a sweet touch?
1524,Chinese restaurants have a dish named in Trump's honor- Orange Chicken.
1525,"No, “Cat’n Crunch”?"
1526,Flavored with the blood of Palestinian children.
1527,Crumbl really needs to do the same.
1528,"Missed opportunity. It should have been called the MoooveOn Scoop the Vote Ice Cream Truck Tour. Alas, I don't live in a swing State, and it will not be coming to me. Imagine the lines if this thing rolled up in Los Angeles. lol"
1529,"They should release a limited edition Trump flavor that's just awful.  People would probably still buy it just for the bragging rights.

""I had a Trumpentine Special!  It was so bad!  The aftertaste lingered in my mouth until I used the attached ginger packet as a palate cleanser!""

""Ohhh that's hilarious!  I'm so jealous!  I'm going to call around and try to find some!"""
1530,"This article is about the Vice President, not the convicted felon. A little disappointed that the comments as a whole don’t reflect that."
1531,im not buying no Kamala iceKream
1532,Good lord.   The left actually thinks this is good and fun stuff.   Smdh.....when the government and all the big corps are pushing the agenda ... There is a problem
1533,"Well they at least got the ""nut"" part correct. 🤢"
1534,I wonder what “cackling  twat””. Is like
1535,"Coconut?

So brown on the outside, white on the inside.

I mean…bold choice lol.

That said, I’d eat her ice cream.  I freaking love coconut snacks."
1536,"Can't imagine what a "" Dick"" flavored ice cream tastes like"
1537,Rich companies love Kamala
1538,Does it change flavors every couple bites?
1539,"> The Harris-inspired ice cream is branded under “Ben’s Best,” not the traditional “Ben & Jerry’s.”

>The coconut flavor is a nod to Harris’s viral coconut tree meme, which stemmed from an anecdote the vice president told about her mother that resurfaced in the last several weeks. The symbol of the coconut tree soon became a sign of support for the Democratic nominee.

>Other election-themed ice cream flavors will be available at the ice cream truck stop, including, “Unburdened by What has Vanilla Bean,” “Inauguration Celebration Birthday Cake,” “Fight for Our Rights Sorbet” and “MoveOn Mobilizer Milk Chocolate.”"
1540,"> “Kamala’s Coconut Jubilee,” described as coconut ice cream with a caramel ripple and confetti stars. 

For those who want to know what’s in it."
1541,I cannot believe they missed out on Caramel Harris
1542,"Finally, something other than the standard flavors like vanilla, caramel, or chocolate that B&J keep trying to sound more interesting than they are. I'm all for coconut."
1543,"Madam Vice President, I wholeheartedly support you, but I will NOT support this. COCONUT? Kamala, anything but coconut..."
1544,"I don't like coconut, but I'd be willing to give this a try."
1545,"I dunno man, coconut is polarizing enough."
1546,Thank you
1547,Perfect 
1548,Coconut ice cream with caramel ripple and confetti stars.
1549,I was worried it wasn’t going to be coconut. I needed more confidence.
1550,"They need a ""Tropical Trump"": served half melted and tastes extremely bitter. 

I dunno what they'd do for JD, though. Just a slice of frozen bread? I hardly think the flavour profile ""memory foam and cum"" would work."
1551,Should have been Blue Wave.
1552,Ewwww coconut.  I'm changing my vote.
1553,I knew that it had coconut -yeah!
1554,Aw…I’m allergic to coconut..
1555,This would be great if I didn’t fucking hate coconut lol.
1556,"coconut: dark on the outside, white on the inside? uhm.. I can just hear the other side criticizing Harris because of that."
1557," Kamala's Coconut Jubilee does sound kinda clever, but I get why people are iffy on coconut. It's definitely a love or hate flavor. I'm more curious about how it'll actually taste, caramel ripple and all. Might be worth a shot if it's served at some rally or something."
1558,"FYI, “coconut” is what South Asians call their western family. Brown on the outside, white on the inside. This feels weird now."
1559,"How bout the MAGA limited flavors like:

""The Origins Creamsicle""

""Roasted Covfefe""

""The Ketchups on the Wall""

1561,Sounds vaguely racist???
1562,Could they do a Trump Orange hair crunch.... Or maybe a Chocolate wet fart forest?
1563,Denver here. Man it would be nice if they could go to some safe blue districts too cause we all love ice cream. We should get some appreciation right?
1564,"It will be an empty tub and the flavor will be ""A Concept of Icecream"""
1565,"And even the people who gladly eat our pets will turn up their noses at it.

  
/s"
1566,"It would actually be hilarious if they released a purposefully gross flavor for him, like they did with jelly beans and some Harry Potter flavors ages ago. Just make it the most bitter and saltiest flavor in existence, with streaks of fudge."
1567,Cat flavoured?
1568,Jelly belly has gross flavor such as booger and earwax that would be appropriate for him
1569,Frozen putrid McDonald diarrhea.
1570,"Better, liver wurst"
1571,"Trump flavor is ""Just Nuts."
1572,"They don’t have a flavor for him, but they have a concept of a flavor! It will be released in two weeks, if the audit is finished."
1573,I really thought you were going to make the acronym be TOILET
1574,Leon Musk's will be literal Shit.
1575,"Nah, it should be called Cats and Dogs, because then we can truthfully say they're being eaten."
1576,"It should be an empty (but dirty) cardboard container, with a note that says: “Excuse me !  Excuse me !!  I only hire the best Ice Cream makers.  We are still taking about the concept.  Everyone should have good Ice Cream.  No one else,  no one else can make Ice Cream as good as me.  Your donations will pave the way for the best Ice Cream.  I promise to punish the Ice Cream makers who don’t make good Ice Cream.  In Springfield they make Ice Cream out of Cats and Dogs.  Cats and Dogs; can you believe it !  Trump Ice Cream will only use the best Cows.  All American Cows.  God Bless America and Ice Cream.”."
1577,thank you for the midday chuckle.
1578,It would be an orange sorbet with a fudge ripple.
1579,Can people stop repeating this? It's not helpful
1580,Ugh. You're so right. That's brilliant. 
1581,It does include caramel as a little pun though 😊
1582,Trump would hear it and it would be his new pronunciation for Harris.
1583,"I was thinking Karamala Krunch, It's chocolate with caramel and either ice cream cone or Oreo/generic cookie pieces"
1584,"> It's orange, tastes like bitterness and ketchup, and smells like a soiled diaper.

*Sedition Swirl*"
1585,Expiration date: 1/6/2021
1586,They don't have a flavor for trump. Instead they have concepts of a flavor for trump. 
1587,"It’ll be out in 6 weeks, pre order first or you don’t get any. If it doesn’t come out in time, or ever, fuck you I don’t owe you shit."
1588,Should've said it smells like dog carcass.
1589,Should taste like crow.
1590,Just call it orange bitters and then it's literally just vanilla ice cream with orange bitters poured on it much like his fake tan lmao.
1591,"Name it after a certain imaginary fat, orange cat "
1592,Should taste like my pet cat.
1593,Don't forget the with notes of covfefe
1594,Let all the MAGA faithful eat that shit by the gallons and claim that it’s delicious.
1595,"Eww.

Ketchup!?"
1596,I’m feeling dumb. Can someone explain to me the “Unburdened by what has vanilla bean” name?
1597,"You might be allergic to it, I have the same issue. I don’t like the taste or the texture. On the other hand I’m allergic to tomatoes and I love them so maybe coconuts just suck."
1598,Looks like there's other flavors available too
1599,"Yeah, I'm not digging this one at all."
1600,Any Trump ice cream would be a glitzy carton that turned out to be empty save for an IOU at the bottom.
1601,The FAILING liberal FDA won't allow bull manure chunks in my ice cream! Sad!
1602,Orange Shitler
1603,The best sounding icecream that is trump themed would have cheetos bits and chocolate chips in it and that still doesn't sound good.
1604,Don't forget the ketchup
1605,This is the best description 😄
1606,"by ""most amazing superlative"" you mean a string of arbitrary and unrecognizable sequences of sounds thrown together and repeated ad naseum?"
1607,Thanks for reminding me to keep buying Tillamook.
1608,"Thank you! I just commented on this before scrolling to see that you had already pointed it out. While Russia was sending their troops to commit atrocities like those seen in Bucha and Irpin, these dumb fucks were spending millions of dollars pushing Kremlin narratives against aid for Ukraine under the guise that not supporting Ukraine would bring about ""peace.""

As we've seen time and time again in occupied territories, not supporting Ukraine does not bring about peace; it brings about subjugation, torture, rape, murder, and destruction of their cultural identity.

If Putin actually feared NATO, he wouldn't have pulled troops from Russia's border with NATO-aligned countries and sent them to fight in Ukraine. Of course, it's really about destroying the cultural identity of the Ukrainian people, claiming their resources, and expanding Russia's power—a goal Ben Cohen tried to help them achieve."
1609,"Hilarious how people argue for a ceasefire in Ukraine without adding in the provision that Russia return the stolen land. Also ridiculous to make the argument about NATO expanding to include places like Finland when Russia was invading Ukraine ten years ago. No shit they want protection from Putin.

But also Ben Cohen isn't involved with the operations at Ben and Jerry's anymore."
1610,"I mean the whole idea is just really really cringe. 

Corporations don't care about you or politics or political issues. They care about making money. They think this will net them more sales and yet these comments are all praising them."
1611,"Thank you for posting this, all their nice ice cream can’t make up for the support that Ben shows Russia."
1612,"Concept of a *plan* for a Trump flavor, you mean."
1613,Burnt orange with toothpaste swirl
1614,"""Orange sherbet and vomit"""
1615,"It's ok, Kamalacare will give you free ozempic"
1616,All the ice cream belonged to him
1617,"> Yokels will be buying out entire freezer sections just to set them on fire.

They won't because the company is not actually making it a flavor and it's not going to be in stores based on the article. It appears they're just going to give it out at specific stops from a truck and a few people in a raffle will get pints of it.

The whole thing is a marketing/advertising campaign to boost sales."
1618,Adderall and incontinence.
1619,How is Americone Dream not on there?
1620,Jimmy's original late night flavor with the chocolate covered potato chips was the best. I miss it!

1632,Good one!!
1633,"Apparently, people have a hard time pronouncing her name. It’s best not to get them more confused and while I would’ve enjoyed a caramel infused pun, this is all the same pretty sweet."
1634,Settle down Alf.
1635,Love that movie.
1636,"If there ever is one, it should be inspired by a McDonald's cheeseburger combo.  And be completely orange of course.  😂"
1637,"Based on the article it seems this is a publicity stunt and it won't actually be a flavor sold in stores. 

>Cohen and Greenfield, at each stop, will also raffle off free limited-edition pints of “Kamala’s Coconut Jubilee,” described as coconut ice cream with a caramel ripple and confetti stars. Tour attendees can enter the raffle online too."

1644,"Makes sense. Most of Trump’s businesses fail, lmao."
1645,This doesn’t even make sense. It’s not even a good burn
1646,Unburdened by what has vanilla bean is an absolutely incredible name
1647,So it's not actually Kamala-flavoured?

1653,"They should have made them chocolate stars. That would have been amazing (I love coconut, chocolate, and caramel together)."
1654,"Well, it had to have “Karamala” ripple"
1655,Hmm I don’t know how I feel about that.
1656,Ha! They've been paying attention! She's probably going to love the caramel.
1657,I was going to give it a try until caramel was mentioned. Bleh.
1658,Probably bc that could perpetuate more mispronunciations of her name
1659,"Oh my god, how did they miss that one?"
1660,"Kamalapplecrumble with walznuts. I’m sorry I didn’t mean for it to be so tawdry it just worked out that people put walnuts on desserts and I don’t know why bc anything + walnuts is worse than before. But, joke wise, it’s kind of right there."
1661,"I have a feeling its because of the ""you didnt just fall out of a coconut tree"" soundbite"
1662,Coconut in ice cream is dope
1663,"Coconut is delicious. Coconut with caramel and sprinkles, I'm not so sure about. Caramel isn't the first thing I think about when I think coconut."
1664,"Fine, raisins it is!"

1674,"They won't because this is a marketing stunt done by a corporation who's goal is to increase sales. 

They're not going to go anywhere where their customer base is strong. The whole point is to get people to try their product."

1692,"Freezing the conflict on the current lines while Ukraine is prohibited from joining the EU or NATO or forming any defensive alliances, is in effect giving Putin a do-over. Letting him rebuild his army and try again later - which is exactly Russia's intention with pushing that kind of 'peace plan'.

Russias opposition to ex-Soviet states joining NATO was never about Russian security. (as seen by Putin now pretending Putin joining is no big deal even though Ukraine is 'different' somehow - as if Saint Petersburg was less important than Rostov-on-Don) 

It was always about Russia keeping the opportunity to retake those countries, by force if necessary. Simple as that. The country is run by an old apparachik who can't accept that their empire is gone. And trying to rebuild that empire is ironically turning that country into nothing but a Chinese vassal."
1693,"just wait! we'll make a YUGE announcement in about 4 months! We're evaluating everything and we'll make it the best flavor ever!

1699,"It’s a reference to how all her positions seem to have changed. Like the border wall, fracking, mandatory assault weapon buybacks, bidenomics, sex change operations for prisoners etc. It could also apply to her self-proclaimed racial identity, or even her “accent” which seems to pop up when convenient (spare me the “code switch” non-sense- that applies to people who speak with an “accent” except when in professional settings, her “accent” is reserved for black audiences, it’s absent in every other aspect of her life- personal and professional). I’m not surprised you don’t find the humor in her being called out for her obvious lack of values or true identity."
1700,"I'm glad they didn't go with ""Happened to Turn Blackberry Sorbet"" "

1742,Bitch it’s in the article
1743,I'll buy ice cream for everyone if Trump is defeated.
1744,Rgr thnx
1745,Thank you!
1746,"""Unburdened by what has been"" is both eloquent and empowering. But it is not a common cadence of language. And this triggered MAGA to use this as an example of Kamala's disconnect from average Americans. When it was in fact paying homage to that which connects all of us: to look forward with optimism while acknowledging we all have past moments that can anchor us in despair.

And it is this message of empathy and hope that upsets the fear and loathing narrative of trump and his cult."
1747,Unburdened Vanilla sounds like the Super Saiyan of flavors if you ask me

1779,Harris and Walz need to do hot ones together so we can watch Kamala calmly eating the death wings while Tim sweats and drinks a bunch of milk. It would be so fun.
1780,Walz cannot handle spicy food.

1794,"“Trump insists he won debate in Truth Social rants despite polls showing 23-point victory for Harris: Live” - Independent 

Also Trump,

“Trump suggests he won’t debate Harris again, attacks ABC over moderators’ fact-checking” - CNN"
1795,Biden made a great decision
1796,"I was gonna vote Biden, of course I was. But I sure as hell wasn't excited about it. I'm excited now and I feel excitement around me."
1797,"Here's a preview of the story: 

Tim Ryan, the former Ohio congressman, said he ""took a lot of hits"" from his fellow Democrats in late June, when he became the first Democrat to publicly recommend Vice President Kamala Harris replace President Biden atop the Democratic ticket, after Biden's disastrous debate performance.

Ryan made waves and headlines on July 2, when he launched a media tour recommending not just that Mr. Biden abandon his reelection bid, but specifically said Harris should be the new nominee.

At a fragile moment, with Democrats frustrated and fearful about the president's reelection prospects, Ryan posted on social media that Harris ""has significantly grown into her job, she will destroy Trump in debate, highlight choice (as an) issue, energize our base, bring back young voters and give us generational change. It's time!""

He said he thought he was just ""whistling in the wind"" a few weeks later, when he later called on Harris to select Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate.

Laughing aloud, Ryan told CBS News he recently received a text message from a friend who was impressed by his newfound ability to predict the future. ""When are we going to Vegas,"" the friend asked.

**Read more:** [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/democrats-who-urged-biden-exit-race-harris/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/democrats-who-urged-biden-exit-race-harris/)"
1798,It’s almost like there was divine intervention here.  I mean it’s very unusual to have a general election debate in June and was something Biden wanted.  Had he not done that debate and just followed the usual script of debates after Labor Day he’d still be the nominee now and everyone would be bracing for big losses.   Even if he did just okay in the June debate it wouldn’t have been enough to push him out.   The fact that he did soooo bad put all of this in motion and gave Harris just enough time to right the ship.   This will go down as the craziest election in my lifetime.
1799,Can’t believe republicans are saying Biden’s move to drop out was undemocratic. Just trying to stir up more things with no substance
1800,"I'll be very happy to toot my own horn on this, the day after elections. 

Until then, your way of life hinges on your vote."
1801,She was masterful as she poked at the idiot and pulled all of his strings.
1802,"It's looking that way, isn't it!"
1803,"The debate bar was limbo-low for Trump. He still tripped.

Harris pole-vaulted over hers.

So the legacy media was trying to figure out how to spin this trainwreck for trump. At which point the Taylor Swift endorsement dropped."
1804,"Are there any actual Democrats who are regretting the decision?  I mean, at this point, even if, God forbid something extreme happens that costs Harris the presidency, I can't imagine a world in which Biden would have performed better."
1805,Americans were screaming for anybody but Trump or Biden for years. She's running a near perfect campaign so far with 7 weeks to go. She's got this.
1806,"I've followed and been a massive fan of Harris for many years and supported her in 2020. I always saw her as a future leader of the country and already knew what she was capable of in grilling nominees and witnesses during her time in the Senate. I knew she had a brilliant mind. 

And still she has been exceeding my expectations to such an extent that I now think she will not only be President but be a transformative President, one of the most important ones we've ever had."
1807,It definitely was good timing for Biden to choose to give way to Harris with a shorter window to the election.
1808,"The immediate unified support behind her and the energy has definitely exceeded my expectations.    She didn’t have much of a presence to speak of in the national consciousness when Biden dropped out, but that really changed overnight."
1809,I was concerned. Now we have donated $600 and counting.
1810,"Shit, I didn't even want him to step down and she's wildly exceeding expectations.  She's knocking it well out of the park."
1811,Democrats (me) that thought Biden dropping out was a terrible idea also think she is exceeding expectations.
1812,I mean obviously. Both that she is exceeding expectations and that they would say that
1813,"Yeah, so far I’d say she’s crushing it."
1814,"I voted for Harris in the 2020 primary, and then of course, for the Biden Harris ticket. I'm also shocked.

It was a roll of the dice, but I also thought Biden needed to step down after the first debate. Not because I'm worried about his capabilities, but because of the collapse in confidence.

Biden stepped down with such masterful grace, and the Democrats have acted with such strategic savvy, great messaging, and energetic zeal to win this thing. Harris and Walz have been flawless in their execution. 

The Democrats are now doing everything humanly possible with such smarts and intensity. The party has our back. We all need to do OUR part. Donate, volunteer, and vote blue with friends! 🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙"
1815,"Biden had the wisdom to pick her, and the courage to bow out. Biden is one of the greatest we will ever see as president."
1816,"I agree.

I felt like I had some idea of who she was, but I absolutely did not. I'm already proud of her, and I will be proud of her as president"
1817,"I’m glad I was wrong about Biden dropping out. I had believed it was too late, Harris was my first choice when Biden won the nomination 4 years ago, but I didn’t know if she could get enough momentum this late in the cycle. I’m so glad I was wrong and so hopeful for the outcome of this election. This is the first time in a long time I’ve felt any amount of hope about the future of our country, despite the decent job Biden has done, I just felt the looming threat of Trump and the GOP making a resurgence. If Kamala smacks down Trump there’s a good chance he won’t make it to the next election and MAGA will fall apart and the GOP might return to sanity and that brings me joy."
1818,Some politicians fail their exit from politics. Biden didn't : What a beautiful and generous way to end a career.
1819,Biden has been such a giid leader that I'm convinced that it was his plan all along to get Harris to win this election.
1820,"It always seemed odd to me that they tucked Kamala away into a cupboard for 4 years when she always seemed very sharp and articulate in her speeches to me. Not to mention her previous career pedigree almost guaranteed she was smart and competent. She would have made a nice contrast to the old aging white guy president who was repeatedly unpopular.

In the end it seems to have worked out better because they got to ""reintroduce"" her to the American people but it always felt like Dems didn't know what they had with her until recently."
1821,"I'm still mad about the timing of everything and the Democrats operating under the premise that Biden could run again for the last *three years* let alone the last three months.

When Biden was first elected he should have been touted as a one term President and the Democrats should have done everything in their power to trot out a list of potential replacements during his Presidency to test the waters with the American people.

We should have seen so much more of Kamala over the last three years doing *something* in the public eye on a regular basis. We should have had a few months of Pete Buttigieg being everywhere like he was the last few weeks, building up his brand with the backing of the Democratic party. Same for Gretchen Whitmer or Gavin Newsom getting some national spotlighting through the Democratic machinery and the Executive Office they occupied, they could have invited them to the White House for a perfunctory dinner and given them some national press to talk about how great they were doing in their states.

Instead we got the panicked, midnight replacement, mockery of the primary process that could have been avoided years earlier if anyone with a brain was operating in the Democratic upper echelon."
1822,"I was honestly convinced that Harris would never get elected because moderates wouldn't vote for a woman of color. Was totally against Biden dropping out.

I've never been more glad to be dead wrong! She's killing it! I feel confident for the first time in a year..."
1823,"Her campaign so far has been nearly perfect -- packed rallies, record-breaking fundraising totals, endorsements across the board (even from Republicans), an energetic, well-coordinated and uplifting convention, and now this decisive debate whupping.  She has no real scandals, she's exceeded pretty much all of the high expectations that have been set for her, and she's running against an old, stale, psychotic convicted felon who tried to overturn a national election.  If she somehow loses anyway, it would be an unforgivable, damning indictment of this country."
1824,"I was one of those people who believed Biden should have stayed in because I thought it would have been bad if he dropped out.

I have been proven wrong"
1825,"I will admit... I was on the fence about the whole thing. I knew it could and should be done, and I knew that Harris would be the most likely replacement if it was done. I had my fears that she wouldn't be able to win it.


Now that we've had some time to see her in action, I'll admit that she's surpassed my own expectations. I haven't felt this hopeful since 2008."
1826,"If we lose this election now, it won’t be because Harris made any serious blunders. She’s a good candidate and she’s really crushing it. It will be simply because too many Americans want a dictator. Not much to be done about that if it ends up being the case."
1827,Shes performing beyond my wildest dreams. Cant wait to go vote for her.
1828,I love seeing so many people admit they were wrong and getting behind Harris the way they have! Truly goes to show which party is the cult and which one just wants the best leader to take us forward into the future.
1829,I know whats exceeding my expectations; that dems were able to come together at all. I wrote my reps because they pushed Biden to leave and I told them to stop being dipshits. “You all will never agree in time to get another candidate ready for the election.” I am very happy to say that I was wrong.
1830,The debate went so well because as a prosecutor she's ideally situated to deal harshly with a criminal.  If she does as well in office America will do great things.
1831,"I thought she was a bad pick, lots of negatives but, i’m very happy i was wrong."
1832,"It’s my opinion the decision was not only the right one, but the presentation of President Biden as a selfless public servant will, in my mind, be an accurate, enduring legacy for others to emulate."
1833,"I think almost all of us feel that way.  I didn't know what to expect from a candidate who couldn't show 1% support in her own attempt at the Presidential primary.

This has been a huge and very pleasant surprise, particularly now that we know she can beat him in debates"
1834,It was always a risk but it was one that had to be made. The perception of Biden after that debate was baked in and he had no path to victory. Harris at least had a chance and so far she’s done well and is probably the favourite at this point.
1835,"I was hesitant about Biden dropping out; mostly because I was afraid there would be a power grab and no unity in the Democratic party; and also for fear that the new candidate may not be any better.

I am so relieved that the Democrats fell in line - which they need to do at the risk of a trump presidency - and that Harris' campaign seems to be doing very well so far."
1836,My expectations was to do better than biden publicly and in the debate. She came across as a normal person running for president. Also she’s not 90
1837,I have a freezer full of crown I have to eat because of Harris.  She's been absolutely killing it.
1838,"Though she had her moments, she was nowhere near this good in the 2020 primaries. Her skilful dismantling of Trump was as near perfect as such a thing could be. 

Now let's see if it leads to improved turnout, which is the only credible path to a Dem victory."
1839,Don’t get complacent! Please make sure to check your registration and vote! Also please consider volunteering to help get the vote out!!
1840,I didn't want Biden to exit and I must say I was wrong. Harris is kicking ass and taking names.
1841,I was very happy and excited when he dropped out. I honestly didn't want to vote for Biden but only because I wanted to see a younger candidate. I had every intention of voting for him tho. The difference now is I am much happier voting for Harris. I feel like alot of voters felt this way. I'm not unique. Most were just not going to vote but they will now.
1842,I will never forget how reports were that they wanted both Biden AND Harris to drop out of the race. I’m so glad she proved them wrong.
1843,Damn right she is 
1844,"The debate made it even more clear that Biden made the right decision to step aside and all the people who put pressure on him also made the right decision. I know it was an incredibly painful decision for Biden to make. But look where we are now. (""we"" = Dems and anti-Trump independents) The fact that he stepped aside has made a huge difference and has given us new hope that we can actually win. I am INCREDIBLY grateful for whoever it was who had the idea to do the first debate so early. I'm so glad that happened, because if not for that debate being when it was, Biden would still be the nominee now and would lose to Trump. Now, Harris might win. Thank you Pres. Biden for making that difficult decision.

So I'm happy right now. But I hope all my happiness isn't for nothing. Trump could still win. It's going to be a loooong several weeks to Election Day. I don't like the suspense... I just want Harris to win already!!"
1845,Great. Vote.
1846,I went from dread with Biden to exhilarating awe with Kamala. She gets it and is amazing.
1847,"Why is this so shocking to people? She was the AG for California, and she's head to head with a guy who has survived in politics on bullying alone. Her opponent is a small-minded, weak, ineffectual convict."
1848,Joe Biden's decision to step down from the ticket cemented his legacy as legendary.  He pulled us through the COVID pandemic and brought us back from the brink of economic disaster.  He also rebuilt the executive branch and our relationships with our allies.  He even passed some of the most significant legislation in recent history with a bitterly divided congress.  We are so lucky to have Joe as our president.
1849,"Turns out, you SHOULD listen to the voters. What a novel concept."
1850,"I did not think Biden dropping out was a good move.  Nothing against Harris at the time, just didn't think that changing candidates would improve the chances for the Democrats.  Happily I seem to have been very wrong."
1851,"When the dust settles, we need to do some reflection about how we watched the media run for four years with an unfair fabricated narrative about Harris being disengaged and marginally competent."
1852,"It hasn't been a disaster, she is doing very well. So nobody who supported this idea would be unhappy, they wouldn't have expected her to poll at 70%, that was never a possibility."
1853,I was worried we wouldn't be united. Glad I was proven wrong.
1854,"Even I was iffy on Kamala. Of course she had my vote from the jump, it was the undecided that I was  afraid wouldn’t get on her train. After that debate though, goddamn…I couldn’t be more excited for her campaign. That debate was a masterclass and showed that country what a real, true to heart presidential candidate looks like."
1855,I can’t believe how in array democrats have been since July 21st.
1856,"I love boring politics, can we please just have boring politicians and politics? Enough overhyping, hyperbole and grandstanding from that narcissistic, twice impeached, 45th!! Please vote!!!!"
1857,"Honestly, feels like pulling a QB fighting to stay in the game despite a gruesome leg injury, hoping the backup can execute a stripped down game plan while leaning on your defense and running game, then discovering you had the next Tom Brady waiting in the wings."
1858,"As one of the Dems that was skeptical of him stepping down, I’ve never been more delighted to be wrong, holy moly."
1859,"I'll eat gladly eat crow on this one. I remember feeling very anxious at the idea of Biden dropping out, but I now think it has been executed masterfully. Fingers crossed that the momentum continues to build."
1860,I admit I thought it was a terrible move to run a black woman against someone who already became president by appealing to racists and misogynists. Looking at the poll numbers I'm still not sure it's a great idea but it was fun watching her beat the shit out of Trump during the debate. Hopefully the polls and especially the vote start reflecting the efforts she and her team are putting in.
1861,"She absolutely is. Even if she loses, it was unequivocally the right move to replace biden with her. I really don't believe anybody can seriously disagree with that now."
1862,"I'm so glad Joe dropped out. The writing was on the wall, he had no chance this election.  At that point, I didn't care who they got in. Kamala wasn't my top choice. Mainly I read too much into her career as a DA and that quote about locking up people for smoking weed left a bad taste in my mouth, I just made the ignorant assumption that she would be a lot more centrist than I had anticipated.

Yeah, she may have moderated her views, but I like her economic plan for working families. Immigration is a bit of a push because they did work on a bipartisan bill but the orange shitstain had to open his mouth because he's so petty and couldn't let his political rival have a political victory. Foreign policy wise, I'd rather have Harris calling the shots. We've seen, and Harris showed the entire world how easy it is to manipulate Trump.

Seeing how she's conducted herself, how she's handled the media and Trump, she's really impressed me with how she stepped up from day 1. I'm not all that confidant that she can win, there are too many variables and a lot of weird shit that the GOP will do, that we can't account for. That being said, she's our best shot at this, and man, I can't believe how we lucked out here. Obama, you knew this guy was going to command the party one day. Kamala, she was just there and fit into the role perfectly."
1863,"I was on the fence about Biden dropping out.

I was too worried about the pros and cons each opportunity offered us.

I'm glad that we galvanized behind a stronger candidate."
1864,"The younger the candidate, the more support they will get. We’re tired of old people ruining things, let someone younger ruin things for us instead."
1865,"I wanted Joe to step down, but I ASSUMED Kamala would get the nomination AND be good at her job. She has FAR exceeded any expectation I had of her ability. 

I look forward to hearing the words ""Madam President"""
1866,This is me. I didn’t think Biden should drop out but I also thought we’d be cooked with him. I just didn’t think we had any options.  Kamala was a no for me. That night she was running I watched everyone’s excitement spike and now I’m more than excited for her. I’m actually excited to vote this year.
1867,"Shouldn’t they have had very high expectations if they were going to blow up the campaign of the guy who beat Trump last time? I mean, of course I’m happy that Harris is doing so well. But it seems like they should have known she was going to do this well before they bet the fate of the nation on it."
1868,Expectations were set pretty low if that's the case.
1869,"Isn't that a requirement for choosing a VP?  At any given moment, the VP should be well qualified to take over the president role."
1870,I was worried and afraid that people would resist Kamala after Biden was pushed out but I'm happy to be proven wrong. 
1871,"Glad the democrats aren't 100% incompetent. Standards are LOW as fuck. Hopefully some day we can vote for who best represents us while still counting our vote against those we don't want in office.

/r/endFPTP"
1872,"I honestly thought they’d put up newsom and was skeptical of Kamala, but she’s been crushing it (a bit too much sucking up to law enforcement, but I understand why it’s happening)"
1873,"She has quiet class. I get Madam Secretary vibes from what’s going on and I’m all about it. 

I was definitely on the “they chose her? Why?” bandwagon. After all, we hadn’t really heard much about her since the start of Biden’s presidency (in hindsight, that should be kinda normal but these haven’t been normal times). But I’m stoked. She seems to have been the right move. So far, well done!"
1874,"I was only against him dropping out because I thought dems would fumble hard and fight over who gets to be the nominee.


Instead we got absolute unity and everyone backing Harris immediately. Which gave the democrats so much momentum. "
1875,"Biden will go down as one of the greatest presidents in history, but nobody will feel that way until he's long dead."
1876,That debate debacle by Biden may have been the best thing for him.  He backs out of the race and looks like selfless person doing it for the country.  Kamala Harris comes in and the Democrats unite around her and the DNC and the supporters are energized.
1877,"Boy do all the liberal redditors, including myself, have egg on our faces now..."
1878,"I'll admit I was a doubter that *anyone* could make up for losing the incumbent advantage (what little there was this election) but boy was I wrong, and glad for it."
1879,"I was worried. 

I was honestly thinking Newsom was the only way we could beat Trump. Not because I didn’t believe in Harris but because I worried about sexism. 

I was wrong. 

She’s kicking ass. She’s going to be the next teddy roosevelt."
1880,I think Biden would have firmed up but would still be behind Harris at this point
1881,"I agree she is doing well, but not at all difficult to exceed expectations here. They were already expecting to lose. Only goes up from there. 🤷🏽‍♂️"
1882,"I honestly didn’t think she had a chance.    I really didn’t know where her support was coming from and there has been more negative said about her over these last 3 to 4 years than anything.   

She has done an excellent job changing perception"
1883,"Republicans need to urge Donald Trump to exit the race.  Assuredly, his replacement will also exceed expectations."
1884,"I was pleased with Harris's performance on Tuesday, at the very least. However, I still have this sense of lingering dread I can't shake off, as though Harris's debate victory was actually an aberration against the tide.

She will have my vote in November, but I hope I will be proven wrong on Election Day. This needs to be a landslide."
1885,"Well yea, she’s not a senior citizen who’s shitting themselves or forgetting their names and names of others…"
1886,"I was so angry when this happened. Fuming. Exasperated. Defeated.


Glad I was so so wrong.


Democrats finally stopped shooting themselves in the foot.


Let's win!"
1887,"When the controversy about whether Biden should step out of the race was building, I was very skeptical that Harris would be a good choice. Her last primary campaign was not great, and she had very unfavorable ratings. But she has greatly exceeded my expectations as a campaigner, and she's a much better candidate this time around. I think her specific policy positions need some work, but that's minor. I'm all in on Harris."
1888,"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/democrats-who-urged-biden-exit-race-harris/) reduced by 84%. (I'm a bot)

1889,"Hell yes! She did!
I was so worried cause the switch happened so late in the election cycle.But seeing Trump's whole ""Sleepy Joe"" attack get defanged has been so worth it.Now he is the older candidate and looks like he has no idea how to handle it."
1890,"I’m actually hopeful and excited, what a confusing time to be a member of the Democratic Party. "
1891,Diamond joe
1892,At the time I was against such a move because I was afraid the Dems would screw it up beyond repair. Kamala has done a great job so far and I'm glad I get another chance at possibly electing the first female president. If I have daughters I want them to live in a world of equal oppurtunity and when I tell them that they can be anything that means anything
1893,"Not surprising, her debate performance was one of the few thing she had going for her in the 2020 cycle.

Edit: NY Times knows... https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/us/politics/harris-past-debate-moments.html"
1894,I had mentioned in a few comments after the debate that I doubted anyone but Biden would be the nominee considering that replacing the current president on the nomination when he still had another term he could serve was incredibly rare. I am so glad I was wrong lmao.
1895,Indeed. I didn't think Harris was a good choice to replace him at first but after seeing her performance I feel a lot better about her chances.
1896,"As a Democrat who was extremely wary of Biden dropping out, even after that awful debate, Harris has overwhelmingly exceeded my expectations."
1897,"It's funny because she was actually unpopular, VERY UNPOPULAR  before Joe Biden stepped down. The support she got frankly came out of nowhere."
1898,"Love Sleepy Joe, greatest President in my lifetime!  Super happy to be wrong about him stepping down, best wrong opinion I’ve ever had"
1899,What's exceeding my expectations is how well the different democratic factions have have unified behind her.
1900,She's doing great. It was clearly the right decision for him to step down. Ironically is another example of his administration making great decisions. 
1901,Tim Ryan for Chief of Staff! His political instincts are off the charts
1902,I was afraid of Biden bowing out and Harris getting the nod because I thought the Right would go into a feeding frenzy. I've never been so happy being so wrong.
1903,"She certainly is for me, I wasn't convinced there would be any difference in perception between the two. I was extremely wary of the idea until I saw how energized Democrats were over the nominee swap."
1904,"passing the torch to her was the best option if he was going to step down. Anyone else would never had been this successful in picking up and running this well and bringing the party with them in damn flawless fashion. Sure others would have been fine. However, her age (speaking generationally), her proximity to Biden and his team (which is basically her team anyway), and her savvy all came together exactly right. Biden should absolutely heralded as a brilliant politician if this all works out. Statesman shit right here."
1905,"Because this is how it was meant to be. He always planned on her running in 2024. He was very clear about this when he announced his candidacy. They played it like he was running again and lured Mushroom Dick into prematurely ejaculating. Then they brought out Kamala to whoop his ass. Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop. Dark Brandon and Kamala are fucking brilliant. So is their team. They've brought so much invigorating energy to everyone. I can't wait for October surprise. It's going to be such a beautiful mess for Donold. 🥳"
1906,I was skeptical at first but now I’m fully on board.
1907,"As someone who followed very closely in the 2020 Democratic Primaries, I was really really surprised by Kamala's performance in this debate against Trump. She looked very solidly competent and I feel a lot better casting my vote now than I did when I first heard she might be the Dem nominee."
1908,"Absolutely! I wanted him to stay in because of how awful she/her campaign was in 2020. I'm not sure what happened, but she learned from her mistakes and has been pitch perfect since taking over. At this point I'm actually happy we didn't have a primary this time because a) the nominee didn't get beat up or tied to specific policy promises, and b) I'm done, the thought of a major campaign for the last two years sounds like a nightmare."
1909,I honestly don't care what those people have to say.
1910,"If there is one thing Americans always want, it is change."
1911,She learned from him. He’s been a master at pulling the levers of power in so many ways
1912,I thought we were done for. But obviously I was dead wrong because Trump wishes he’s running against Biden right now.
1913,"She’s exceeding my expectations, at least. She’s on fire."
1914,"I was also wrong,we are moving forward!"
1915,"As Biden would say, ""You're god damn right she is!"""
1916,"I think everyone would say she's exceeding expectations.

I'm very happy for her."
1917,I was completely for Biden leaving and completely against Harris becoming the next candidate. I'm glad she proved me wrong.
1918,No shit
1919,It completely changed the dynamics. My tired old man is better than your tired old man was a choice no one wanted.
1920,"I think it's less about the candidate, though she's not hurting things, but the fact that everyone quickly and loudly united behind her.  Everyone knows what's at stake."
1921,Because Biden's handlers and the DNC kept her away from the public for years because they knew anyone standing next to Biden with an actual pulse would outshine the President.  
1922,Democrats need to stick together
1923,"I agree, she wasn’t even on my list of desired replacements but by god she’s doing a fantastic job so far not only with her performances but also in policy. I was worried she’d be a little too status quo for my taste but her tax policy looks solid and I love the heavily pro union VP pick. They’re sitting at a very solid 8/10 for me, I’d love to see more pro union policy and social programs."
1924,"I'm happy to say I was wrong about Biden staying it.

I was worried America wouldn't accept Harris being forced into the running so late however it seems like she is exactly what everyone wanted. It's starting to feel like Obama 2.0"
1925,"Im just exceedingly worried about how tight the polls are. He can still win 🤮
Its not over til its over, we must vote"
1926,I am very pleasantly surprised how quickly we were all able to rally around a new candidate and how good she has been at bringing in everybody. The stakes couldn't be higher
1927,"I was against Harris being the nominee because after 2016, I was like ...my country is sexist and racist. It'd be nice if she could win but there's no way.  

Makes me so happy how she's exceeding expectations and how excited people are. Makes me feel like Trump was the deviation from the (new) norm. Not Obama. 

I really like her. Picking Tim Walz was an amazing move, and her debate performance was...wow. She was playing chess and baiting him and he was falling for it everytime. 

I know there's criticism of her policy being not as left as it should on Palestinez fracking and the border, but this is a democracy not a dictatorship and it's our job as activists to move general opinion closer to ours and then have the politicians follow than have a demogogue who will alienate people who think differently.

Remember, Obama said he was anti gay marriage and then was the one to fight  to legalise it once public opinion reached the 51% mark. I knew his stance was bullshit and just politics but a lot of people didn't. I knew we'd (the gays)  be in good hands with him. 

Character matters more than stated policy. I know that sucks for people who just want straight talk but straight talk can get you into a lot of trouble and out you in a news cycle that can derail your plans.

I'm pretty confident we're in good hands with her. Again, the Walz pick and her debate strategy"
1928,My expectations weren’t exceeded. I knew she’d kill it.
1929,I admit that I was calling for another candidate to step up and didn’t believe that Kamala was up for the task. I was definitely wrong in my thinking. She’s done great so far.
1930,Biden's hail mary is paying dividends.
1931,Biden was cooked. I wasn’t going to vote for dementia Joe
1932,"To all those who said that anyone wanting Biden to drop out was a fascist who wanted Trump to win...

... who said that there would be no unity around a nominee...

... who predicted months of infighting...

... who said nobody but Biden could get on ballots...

... who insisted Harris was even less popular than Biden...

... who claimed it was ""ignoring the primary election"" and ""disenfranchising voters""...

... who said prominent Democrats were ""bought by fascists"" to call for Biden to leave...

I hope you have learned something."
1933,"People who get what they want tend to think it's a good thing. Not really news. 

I wanted Biden to stay in. I was certain that the party was going to fracture, the right was going to push hard on the fact not one voter actually picked her (it's true, regardless of anything else) and that she would bomb any debate by coming across smug and unlikeable as she pretty much always has. 

I was wrong on all 3 and she's doing great. I admit my mistakes and I'm glad for it. I'll never really be comfortable with the nominee getting 0 votes in any primary this year but I won't accept Trump so this one time we can skirt around democracy. But just this once. The party should never try this again."
1934,"I knew in 2020 she would make a great President, and was sharp and intelligent and caring. I have never understood this narrative -- often from both sides of the aisle -- that she is stupid, inarticulate, lazy, etc. It's not true. Not one thing in her entire life points to her being stupid, lazy, or inarticulate.

She was a great DA, AG, Senator, and Veep."
1935,"Hm. Honestly.. I was on the fence about Harris right from the start. Not that I didn't think she would do better than Biden, almost anyone at that point would have.. But the question was always, can she actually do good enough to win. And so far, I'm still skeptical (because of polling).

She is doing a very good job at the DNC, Debate, interview, rallies. All very good. In that sense, maybe she is doing a little better than I was expecting. But polling wise, she is doing about as I would expect, and that's not good enough to win. This assumes polling is actually accurate or that Trump still has a polling error advantage like in previous yers..  Which he  might not have. If they fixed the Trump polling errors from 2016 and 2020, then she might be okay!

If she ends up loosing, I won't blame her or the decision for picking her. I think she's giving it all she has. It wouldn't be her fault, it would be the people voting that didn't do their job. Or rather, the ones that didnt vote."
1936,But she has to win.
1937,Dude a 100% when Trump got “shot at” and Biden dropped I thought the dems are done. But she’s doing great so far.
1938,"I was one of those who was saying since the debate that Harris should replace Biden, even when others here were screaming about how “unlikeable” she was.

Glad I was right! 🤭"
1939,"I still think we should have had a speed run primary with actual voting. I'm all for Harris and she has been a fantastic candidate so far, but I am a *little* tired of the DNC anointing candidates (such has Biden and Hillary)."
1940,And yet Nate Silver apparently still thinks she's going to lose?
1941,Duh.
1942,"It's funny, they replaced him to protect down-ballet races, as it looked like it was going to be a slaughter (Republicans ALWAYS show up, Democrats need to be convinced to show up, and if they stayed home it would have risked them losing in States that are solid blue). They were forced to pick Kamala due to Biden's endorsement, but it looks like it might pay off. 

At this point it looks like she is going to win the popular vote by quite a bit, which will cement the down-ballet. Whether she will overwhelm the popular vote enough to win the Electoral College is another question, but definitely in the realm of possibility now."
1943,"In fairness, ""This idea I kept pushing is doing very well"" is not the most impressive flex."
1944,"Dear every single person who INSISTED with the moral certainty of Dwight Eisenhower launching the D-Day invasion that Kamala is the weakest choice because *not her* anyone **not her** was ***not her*** better than ***NOT HER*** Biden, but Kamala was the worst choice because Pot or Israel or Racism (you see they are not the racist they're just worried racists won't vote for her) or whatever other excuse of the hour but insisted that a contested convention cam totally make a Newsome/Whitmer ticket work and it wouldn't be a clusterfuck of bureaucratic horseshit just trying to get a brand new campaign off the ground and all the legal issues of moving campaign money wouldn't happen because David Axelrod said so or some shit:

Fuck you. You owe us an apology.

Edit: fixed a typo. Wrote Congested Convention instead of Contested Convention and honestly I'm kinda wishing that were a thing. Too many candidates blocking up the whole process sure sounds like congestion."
1945,Yes. I noticed that.
1946,Never not surprised when people say a qualified woman is doing better than they thought she would.
1947,Low bar to jump over
1948,"I gotta be honest, I hated the whole „Biden should drop out“ Discussion and I was super disappointed when he actually did. Not because I don’t like Harris, but because I thought it would be an incredibly dumb move so far into the election and it would only hurt the Democrats. 

 Boy, was I wrong! "
1949,"I think the real MVPs are the Biden/Harris 🤝 Harris/Walz campaign staff. These folks for the last few years have eaten, drank, and slept in making sure that Biden/Harris would see a second term. 

And I think a lot of people slept on how prepared they were for the potential that Harris would have to step into the lead role. And once Biden decided to step aside and endorse Harris, they performed that transition flawlessly, with no in-fighting, sour grapes or defections within the campaign staff."
1950,"If she can keeps Old Joe around for advice as a consultant on how to work across the aisle, she can be the best President in our lifetimes."
1951,I thought Biden should stay in because a move to any other Democrat would be even more likely to fail.  It turns out that I was the opposite of correct.  Harris is killing it.  Onward!
1952,"Imagine being upset about fact checks correcting you on people in Ohio eating dogs. On whether the election was stolen, and whether babies were being murdered after they were born. Imagine a normal person saying any of that. How the hell is Donald in this election?"
1953,[When you're doing so well that your supporters divest in your stock.](https://i.imgur.com/T7ysN9w.jpeg)
1954,"Read about this while the debate was live; no one cared Trump got fact checked, it was that Harris did *not* get fact checked that pissed off the conservatives. 

It fed into their whole “the system is prosecuting Trump” bullshit because they believe Harris lied, and didn’t get fact checked as a show of ABC’s support of her."
1955,I was against it and I was horribly wrong. Onward!
1956,"When I was in highschool, I couldn't see why teachers were so emotionally invested in elections from years ago.

Now that I'm in the middle of a historic saga... Yeah, I get it."
1957,"It's crazy to me that it was such an unpopular opinion around here until he actually made it and then people acted like it was the correct choice all along. 

I was worried before the debate, his age was a huge concern to me (Trump's too) and that criticism was largely dismissed here. After the debate I knew he would lose if he ran. It was a much bigger risk to not drop out. 

Even then people were staunchly defending him as the best person for the job. 

I'm not sure why people are so surprised that somebody not in their 80's looks much more able to handle Trump on a debate stage. She's an accomplished prosecutor and politician. 

I do hope after this election cycle we learn that a choice between two dinosaurs isn't what people actually want."
1958,"Yes, but he should’ve made this decision much earlier, like, after the 2022 midterms"
1959,"I imagine that while it was tough, he is seeing that it was the correct call. Credit to him for eventually recognizing that"
1960,"He also had great timing with it. He deserved a chance to see if he could turn it around, and when it became clearer that wasn't going to happen, he ultimately did the thing that was best for the country. He will go down in history as one of the greatest Presidents because of his self-sacrifice and laying ego aside. A true hero."
1961,"A true Patriot puts their country ahead of themselves. I'm sure he wanted another four years for himself, but the fact that he was willing to put his own interests aside for the greater good of the United States is the ultimate example of doing the right thing, even if it's something you don't want to do. Joe Biden will forever have my upmost respect."
1962,"Could you imagine the conversations we'd be having today if Biden was in that debate, this week, rather than Harris?"
1963,Biden is a hero and shall be remembered as a legend!!
1964,"Biden set a great precedent.  Following Trump's embarrassing debate performance against Harris, Trump should clearly step down."
1965,I think this was the plan all along. I thought this when he chose her for his running mate.
1966,"Biden absolutely nailed it. I was also very hesitant for the last minute change, but damn. This is great."
1967,And women tend to be underestimated.
1968,"Plus, he will be a great asset for Kamala when she becomes president. He’ll help her achieve."
1969,"He's a true American patriot that made a brave choice to protect his country's democracy. Biden will go down in history as one of the most effective presidents, in part because of crushing Trump's 2nd and 3rd attempt at the office."
1970,"I honestly don’t think it was his decision, he probably got the boot. But it definitely was what we needed"
1971,Same here. I went from begrudgingly voting for the dem to loving Kamala. I’ve come to the obvious conclusion that she is far more likable than her critics.
1972,"Biden just couldn't muster this kind of excitement.  He would still be a fine president for another term because he's a smart, good person.  He just isn't spry enough to do this kind of 3 rallies per day 6 days a week for the next 9 weeks.  Harris was exactly what was needed for Democrats to get people off the fence of ""old men squabbling politics"" and then we'd be facing a voter apathy problem. "
1973,"I remember that Tim Ryan called for Kamala Harris to the the Democratic nominee, and thought that that was a bit weird since she was polling worse against Trump than Biden, but he was absolutely correct, that's very impressive "
1974,"Interesting to see news sites directly posting their articles on these forums, but I guess it’s better being up front than how Russian media poses as users"
1975,Ryanstrodamus.
1976,"The way I felt after the Biden vs. Trump debate compared to how I felt after the Harris vs. Trump debate is like night and day. After Bidens performance I thought we were screwed as a nation and we were either going to lose with Biden as the nominee or the Dems would have contestant infighting and clusterfuck of a convention. I could not have been more wrong and after Harris wiped the floor with Trump Tuesday night I feel hopeful, confident, and ready to kick some fascist ass in the voting booth."
1977,"I’m just surprised that all of this is happening in my lifetime. I’m 32 now, but growing up, America has always felt so “traditional” compared to other western/developed countries. 

I didn’t expect us to do anything to really shock the world - unless it was related to space exploration, entertainment, or sports.

Yet here we are having moments that are exceptional and rare for America. In a strange way it worries me, even scares me. At least the way I see it, America truly is malleable - and maybe even more fragile than we ever imagined. 

Just think, in 30 years, we (Americans) could be living under a newly revised constitution. It sounds impossible. However, if you had even hinted to people 30 years ago that then Senator Biden would be President for 4 years, then choose to step down after losing a debate to convicted felon, people would have said it ‘wouldn’t work that way’ because an incumbent would never step down. And— Americans would never accept a conviction felon.

We’re living in strange times."
1978,"> This will go down as the craziest election in my lifetime.

The last two elections have been like this.  It keeps getting crazier."
1979,[deleted]
1980,"I personally thought that the predictions of a Trump and Republican win before Biden dropped out seemed off, since the Democrats performed well in every election starting in 2018, and also voters in elections around the world (like in France and India) rejected the extreme right, so it just wouldn't really make sense if they went again this trend and elected Trump again in the US."
1981,"My happiest conspiracy theory is that this was all theater and that Biden was in on it from the start.  And still totally legal and not nefarious, maybe except for luring Trump to a debate under false pretenses, which I will forgive because he's pure evil"
1982,"Genuinely thought this just now, but maybe with all the worshipping and throwing God's name around for Trump, claiming he and his cronies are part of His will, God looked at what's going on and said ""... Nope."" and made this happen. Gotta remember, he didn't like people being worshipped like gods in the Bible."
1983,Craziest election so far…
1984,"Biden was never going to run again. It was set up in a way to make Trump think he was going against Biden to then make a 180 on him. I'm convinced of this. The way they waited till after the Republican convention was masterfully done. They knew what they were doing for months. On the Monday after the official 'dropping' out. The Harris campaign already had their tshirts. 
The weeks before Biden dropping out there were a few other names brought up. Like Newsom and Whitmer. They were very visible in the talk shows leading up to the 'decision'. When asked if they thought of running for president they all said the same thing. ""I like your Tie"".   


They had all met with the administration the weeks before and were all told what was going to happen. 


It was a purposeful attack against Trump's campaign for over a year. 


My thoughts. "
1985,">This will go down as the craziest election in my lifetime.

Well, shit, son, now you've said it. The universe heard it. This may not even be top ten by the time things are all said and done."
1986,"My conspiracy theory is his team was nervous that he could perform and so they put it so early to show the American people if he could or couldn’t. If he couldn’t, there was time to shift their strategy or possibly even candidate"
1987,"It wasn’t divine intervention, it was Pelosi. 

Look, I’ve been critical of Pelosi my whole life, but the woman did the work to align the delegates, force Biden’s hand, Promise him a graceful send-off and deliver on it.

She and Chuck were the leaders we needed at the moment."
1988,"""We're a republic not a democracy!"" crowd is suddenly concerned about democracy.

Let's just ignore how delegates acting on behalf of the voters, such as in the case of the Harris selection, is very much a feature of Republics."
1989,Ahh yes because inciting an insurrection on the capitol and attempting to overturn the results of a free and fair election is certainly democratic. These so-called republicans are for sure experts on the principles of democracy lol
1990,"I mean, I guess it technically was but the entire process of picking the president isn't very democratic to begin with.  The nomination process gives all of the power to people in a few early voting states, some candidates drop out by the time it even gets to me (California).  Super delegates also have the ability to override our primary vote effectively. 

Then there's the fact that the presidential election is decided by a 250 year old system that was created to give slave owning states more voting power, and has given us two presidents that didn't win the popular vote in the last 25 years.

Hell, usually the incumbent president doesn't even have to worry about the primary race.  In 2020 Trump was given it automatically and didn't have to debate any prospective candidates. The presidential nominee have never been a democratic process."
1991,"right;  the only expectation I have is that we blow MAGA out at the ballot.  Until then, everything else is just happy talk."
1992,"Remember: Harris is only ~2 points ahead in polls. She needs more than that to win. Remember 2016-- the popular vote is not enough.

Vote, vote, vote."
1993,"Regardless of what happens in November, it's already quite clear that Harris at least gave us a *much* better chance. 

Now let's finish the job."
1994,"I'll be honest, if harris can't beat trump with this much energy and unity, i dont see how biden could have done so(or honestly *any* other dem candidate as well)."
1995,"For some it's likely our actual lives on the line, tbh"
1996,"I just can't be excited with this much dread. My mother loves to triumphantly declare ""we're not going back,"" and it pains me to say ""well tyranny might decide that that's not up to you"""
1997,toot tooot
1998,"Don’t just vote, organize! If everyone on this sub knocked 100 doors the dems would sweep so hard this fall."
1999,"Yeah, puppet"
2000,"No the debate made that crystal clear, the contrast between bidens performance and hers was night and day."
2001,"Dems still lose if we have really bad markets and bad job / unemployment reports going into Nov…. But I feel like that would be the case with Biden just as well.

Harris finished Trump this week as much as any candidate could, and I don’t think Trump will ever recover.

He can still win though, sadly. Or steal the whole thing through judicial fuckery."
2002,"Not perfect, but near perfect. Trump is just a moron everyone overlooks the minor mistakes."
2003,As long as we Vote and make sure all our friends do too
2004,"My wife and I supported her going back to 2017 after seeing her speak at a protest against the Muslim ban. But we were both let down by her 2020 campaign. I think she got bad advice to kind of split the middle between Bernie and Biden and it flopped pretty hard.

I think she actually has the potential to an extremely good President as she has worked really hard to get where she is, being a prosecutor, city and State AG are not easy jobs."
2005,For her to be a transformative President she will need to have the House and the Senate. Without the two legislative chambers her Presidency will be dead in the water from the start.
2006,I feel the same way I was pushing for her to be the candidate in 2020. I think her sharp wit and Sassy rhetoric or exactly what we need to combat trump. I was sold after her performance at the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
2007,Anyone who hasn't watched her grill Republicans as a senator is in for a treat. Jeff Sessions straight up told her to her face that she was making him nervous. 😂
2008,"I have backup on this, but when Biden picked her as VP my mom texted me during the convention asking what I thought about Kamala since she didn’t really know anything about her and I live in CA. My response was, “she’s going to be the first female president.” Happy to see that it’s looking like I might have been correct!"
2009,Particularly after Trump selected Vance as his limping mate.
2010,"The timing was even better considering he waited until after the RNC when they spent the entire time ripping Biden as cognitively impaired and feeble. Then after the RNC bump, he drops out and takes the wind out of the Trump campaign’s sails."
2011,I think this is a good indicator that changing election season from literally every single day of every year to only a few months before each set of elections wouldn’t hinder campaigns too much
2012,"Same. 

I was afraid that his dropping out would lead to a contested primary with only a small amount of time before the convention. It would leave the dems in disarray, and leaving Trump practically unopposed for weeks, seeming to be the only strong candidate. Then the resulting dem candidate would seem bruised and with questions about dem support for them.

Instead, Harris consolidated support within about 2 days, and her campaign started to fucking finally have the dems take off the gloves against Trump."
2013,"I wouldn't say that you were ""wrong"".  I didn't want him to drop out either.  However, there was no way we could have anticipated how this change to VP Harris would go.  My hesitance was because this change could have gone very very badly."
2014,"That's absurd. Love him, but no."
2015,VPs getting tucked away is kinda the norm. They originally were the 2nd place candidate.
2016,"We donated shortly after she announced, when she picked Walz, and the day after the debate. I knew those would be good fundraising days, and I wanted to add our small donations to totals that would make Republicans truly lose their sh*t

I hope she buries them, all down the ticket"
2017,"I was just like you. 

I had concerns that she wouldn't be up to the campaign, which would be grueling. I didn't fully get her voice and how she presented herself. 

I have never been happier to be wrong. 

She also has a kick ass staff behind her. She always looks so well put together and sounds so prepared. That doesn't happen in a vacuum."
2018,"That whole ""1%"" Republican talking point is BS btw. She never polled that low and dropped out before voting started."
2019,Fun fact.  She has never lost an election she went all the way to voting day in.
2020,"It'll only be legendary if we win. If not it'll be too little, too late."
2021,"It only worked out bc of the way it was handled. It could’ve only been Harris. She provided change for the people who wanted that without angering those who were still supporting the ticket. If Biden hadn’t endorsed anyone or they decided to have an “open process” like Pelosi and some pundits suggested, it would’ve been a lot harder to seamlessly unite enough to turn the page and regain the momentum of the race."
2022,"The lingering sense of dread is VERY appropriate.  Regardless of what the national vote total is, this election is still going to come down to a few 10s of thousands votes in a very small number of states.

Add on top that the GOP has been positioning things for a couple years to create confusion and chaos in the electoral process AFTER the election.  Just because VP Harris ""wins"" on Nov. 5th doesn't mean its over.  That is when the real craziness will begin.  November and December are going to be 2 of the craziest political months in most of our lives."
2023,Yes I remember 2016 to clearly. The absolute devastation of Trump getting elected over Hillary is not a feeling that will go away easily. And the anxiety of him getting elected again makes me almost nauseous.
2024,"I saw his muppet followers getting pissy about and saying that using the city manager as a source wasn’t good enough / believable, yet at the same time believing a habitual liar that used “but television!” as his *cough* source ….mate, their brains are as fuckin fried as his"
2025,It amazes me that these people cannot comprehend the truth negates the need to be fact checked.
2026,I keep asking them to give me the facts checks now and none of them have.
2027,"I thought Biden should step down and that they should have an open primary.

I also thought Senator Mark Kelly from Arizona should be VP instead of Walz.

I was happily wrong on both.  The Harris / Walz ticket is exactly what we need."
2028,"Biden’s over all leadership skill is highlighted by selecting her for the VP to get her involved at the highest level. Help her get that much needed experience and on track for this moment. Of course she had to show up, work, learn and execute and she has done that wonderfully,  but credit to Biden for using his power and influence to help set America up for success. 

They have been a great team so far and I’m very excited to see Harris take this next step and lead our country forward."
2029,"I was also against it. I didn’t expect the immediate unity, Kamala go be a badass, and the campaign to fire on all cylinders."
2030,"I was also against it largely based on 2 things. 1. If Biden stayed in I figured Dems would rally around Biden post DNC and a lot of the polling turnaround for Harris would have still happened simply from Dems actually answering polls. 2. I assumed (I think reasonably) that Biden dropping out would have caused an internal conflict within the party that would only hurt our chances as 4-5 candidates spend time backstabbing each other to get power. 

The Dems actually having a brain for once and rallying around the only reasonable choice in Harris and Biden’s quick endorsement and graceful exit has honestly been a masterclass."
2031,"I am SO glad to be wrong about Biden dropping out. I didn’t expect Kamala to do such an amazing job, and I was completely wrong about her VP pick as well. They have knocked it out of the park consistently, and I’m so excited to vote for them."
2032,"Same, the main reason being that there would be a clusterfuck primary that would waste time, enthusiasm and resources leaving the democrats in a worse position. But Biden was able to deftly pass the torch and unify the party around Harris in a way that was really unexpected"
2033,"I was hesitant too, and thought that replacing Biden would have hurt their chances even more than that bad debate. But I was wrong as well.

Right there is a big part of the difference between the two sides.

Those in the MAGA movement can never admit to being wrong. No matter how tiny of a thing it is, they'll double or triple down and insist over and over that they totally meant to type 'Covfefe'."
2034,"Appreciate you saying this.  I started calling for his withdrawal almost immediately after that debate and so many supporters eviscerated me for it.  I don’t hate Biden, I have a ton of respect for the man (along with some major issues with his crime bill in the 90s) but once I watched that debate I knew it was over for him.  It had to be, or they would’ve handed the election to trump."
2035,Woah there buddy. You just can't admit you were wrong about something. This is American politics.  You gotta double down and start yelling!
2036,I was very angry by this move but I now know this was a very wise and strategic move! Wow!
2037,"I was against it as well, until the debate. At that point I was not optimistic but thought the only chance we had  was to roll the dice, and we got a fuckin yahtzee"
2038,"I was for it, and I am surprised at how great a job she is doing.

Clearly all she needed was a few years in the White House to get over any ""imposter syndrome"" induced nervousness she might have previously experienced and start to feel comfortable with the idea of actually being in the role of president."
2039,"Thank you for admitting so!

The bigger person can admit they were wrong and move forward.

You are a gentlepersonand a scholar."
2040,"I really appreciate you and others admitting that; I was pro-Biden dropping out, and was insulted in all sorts of ways by people who didn't want him dropping (not you, but others who were more pro-Biden second term) out in the few days following the debate, and people claiming I just wanted Trump to win or was even ""secretly MAGA"". 

My predictions weren't without flaws either, I had thought Kamala was ultimately the safest choice but thought she wouldn't do *nearly* as well as she has, so I was wrong as well. 

And at the end of the day, I don't want to do a ""they were wrong and we were right"" bullshit since it's not conducive to improving our country, I just want us to unite and fight back against fascism effectively (and as I said, I was wrong on many important things before as well). 

It just really rubbed me the wrong way how I and so many others faced a *lot* of vitriol for simply wanting a better candidate, people claiming we were closeted fascists for wanting something that ended up quite possibly saving our country from fascism."
2041,"I was against it until the debate, and then I was just miserable like ""it doesn't matter what happens, we're getting trump, there goes the country etc"" and wow my hopes and spirits are high now."
2042,"I genuinely felt like he was in a no win situation, stay in or drop out I felt like the election was over. So happy to have been proven wrong."
2043,Same. At least we can admit it. Now let's go take away as much power from the GOP as fucking possible.
2044,"It scared me as well. Either choice (staying in or bowing out) seemed like a mistake. At the time, I felt that making any changes would come across as “weakness” and give T a boost. We won’t know of it was a good decision until the votes are counted, but I’m now glad the decision was made."
2045,"I'm glad we're through it and we're all on the same side again, but as someone who grew up in the Midwest bouncing between the same swing states we were competing in...that stretch of time was so maddening. It was blindingly obvious that Biden was unelectable. Will Smith immediately after the slap was more electable. Walk out in public and the first person you see is probably more electable than Biden. Our only two options with him were a Trump victory or a Trump landslide with a congressional supermajority. It was like our own party was endorsing Trump and that stretch of time had us all tearing out our own hair."
2046,"In fairness, I wanted Biden to step aside but I had no idea Kamala was going to do this well. I’m not a strategic genius; I got very lucky. Our roles could very easily have been reversed."
2047,"Same. Not in the sense that I didn’t think Biden was a liability, but more that I did not expect the party to come together so strongly behind a single candidate. I liked Kamala but of course wasn’t sure how she would do knowing her 2020 run. 

They and she exceeding all expectations"
2048,"Yeah, I was terrified that we'd be giving up the incumbent advantage. But we may have just sort of doubled it. A fresh face AND the incumbent advantage.

But I also felt bad because I really like the Biden admin. He's probably the best president of my lifetime."
2049,"I was in favor, but ONLY if it was guaranteed the party would rally around her, and for various reasons she really was the only option.

Now, that kind of guarantee takes a lot of back room talk before it’s public and we couldn’t have known, but I’m so glad everything worked out. Dems are in array."
2050,"I agree. I was really worried that Republicans wanted this as a Hail Mary to get a completely unprepared, floundering Democratic party to fight against, and I thought they'd get it. Then Kamala happened and... Well, we know the rest. 


It's gone tremendously better than I expected, and even better than I'd hoped. What's more, I think it's gone even worse than the GOP feared. Which makes me smile. "
2051,"I have never been so happy to have been so wrong in my life. Warms this cold heart, it does."
2052,"This is one that I will gladly admit I was wrong on. I have a degree in political science and used to work for a lot of campaigns and I was screaming that it couldn’t be her. This is why I’m not the leader of the free world, and Biden is. Good decision on his part."
2053,Same! I felt sick when it happened and now I’m so glad it did. Happy to be wrong!!
2054,"Thanks for coming clean! I understand why you felt that way, truly, but I’m glad you can admit you were wrong. This is why we are better than the far right. 

I’m just an idiot and I’m not special. I was hoping for Biden to step down and I was championing for Harris. It was lonely. But I do truly understand why it was a lonely, risky, position to take. I just hope it all works out in November."
2055,Me too. I've never been so glad to be wrong in my life
2056,Preach. Normalize changing your mind when presented with new info! I originally wanted Biden to drop out and have somebody *other* than Harris take the reigns but I have been super impressed with her.
2057,"Same, I'm ok with being wrong"
2058,"It's nice when people are able to admit they were wrong. I've been wrong lots of times, too."
2059,"same i thought for sure it would be a huge, reactive mistake

i'm glad i was very wrong"
2060,Me too but I'd say we were wonderfully wrong considering how things are going  now.  I have never been so delighted to be wrong in all my life
2061,Same. I was dreading what was to come but Harris really took up the baton and ran this harder than I'd ever expected. She really is ready for the presidency.
2062,Takes a lot of guts to admit that!! Biden was heroic in withdrawing. Nuff said.
2063,"I love how wrong I keep being about Harris. I thought she wouldn't be a likable candidate and people wouldn't get behind her. Wrong! I thought the debate wouldn't help her at all and there was no point in debating Trump. I even thought she'd screw up against him. I was so wrong! I can't wait to vote. I'm doing it on the first or second day of early voting, and I'm going to be hyping up all my friends to do the same."
2064,I was against it until the debate. Biden was just... bad! It was embarrassing.
2065,"I was so scared at first. It looked like they basically gave the keys to the White House to Trump.

But then we were proven wrong. Best choice ever, and it will be a legacy for him."
2066,"She has been very impressive since she took over the nomination, you can tell she was prepared to take the ball and run with it"
2067,"I was also against it. 

1) I felt it was unfair to Biden after all his accomplishments

2) It felt like panic after a bad debate

3) I didn't like all the talk about mini-primaries to get a new candidate, as I worried that if the Dems didn't pick Harris, we would splinter the coalition to pieces. 

I was pleasantly surprised that no. 3 didn't happen, and that the party united behind her so decisively. I still think a lot of it was born of panic, and Biden was trying to prove he could still do it, and likely deserved more time, but I understand why they did it, and ultimately, it was his decision, and it turned out to be a really good move."
2068,"Same and was called a bot relentlessly but there was a LOT of uncertainty there. Glad to have been proven wrong (also proven wrong about the TS endorsement, have never been happier for my streak of inaccurate predictions!)"
2069,same here. i was scared but i feel like we might at least have a CHANCE with kamala
2070,Same. I underestimated how unhappy they were with current state of affairs that they would even consider bringing Trump back.
2071,"Same, and I’m very glad I was so wrong!"
2072,"Yes, me too. I was wrong. 

I think it's hard for folks who liked Biden to understand the criticism, or realize how much enthusiasm was waiting for a younger, charismatic new candidate. 

Charisma, identity, gender, race, age, and propaganda matter immensely in politics. It's hard to calculate these without hindsight. "
2073,"I was really unsure about it, but I was glad to be proven wrong. You just never know with these things man."
2074,I called it a year ago. But I was convinced he wouldn’t seek the re-election.  So I guess it doesn’t count.
2075,"You and me both. I still think it was risky as hell, and know Biden would have had a good 4 more years. But the choice paid off and Harris is showing a ton of potential and energy. 

In retrospect it was the best decision, and my opinion of both the current and future presidents have grown since then. It takes a lot of courage to step down. 

On-wards to (hopefully) 8 more years of good things!"
2076,Same. I thought it was too late for Biden to drop out. I'm so glad I was wrong.
2077,I was mainly against him dropping because I was so worried about the dems devolving in to extreme infighting and not being able to unite around a candidate. The fact that the near immediately closed range around Harris erased all of those worries.
2078,"Never in my life have I been so glad to have been wrong.

Kamala is absolutely everything the USA needs right now."
2079,"I thought it was too late, so I was also against it. While it’s not in the bag by any stretch she finally gives me a sense of hope instead of despair. Biden should be remembered fondly for this regardless of the outcome. It couldn’t have been an easy decision for him to make…even if he was given a rather aggressive push toward it."
2080,"Same. I have never been more wrong, and never been happier to be so."
2081,"I was also against it, and I was wrong. I thought frankly that this country is too racist and misogynist to elect her. I hope I am wrong about that as well. She has been an exceptional candidate so far and I will be proud to vote for her. "
2082,"I was against it precisely because she is currently ""defying expectations."" It is going so much beer than anyone had any right to believe it would.

They wanted an open fucking convention and a ""mini primary,"" lol"
2083,I've never been so glad to be so completely wrong.
2084,"Same with me. I didn't understand how I got it so wrong and now I think I figured out my mistake.

My main crux was that it was too late in the game to swap out a incumbent canidate, let alone the one who beat the other guy once already.

But thats not true. Other countries election cycles are MUCH shorter than in the US and there was absolutely plenty of time to field a new candidate. 

That was something that I learned so I hopefully will be less wrong in the future."
2085,"I get you, I still remember the Nixon Kennedy debate from 1962.  This was the most interesting debate since then."
2086,"I think people were just scared. I know I was. Change is hard for a lot of people, and given how splintered the Democratic Party had been for the past few years it was hard to imagine that, if Biden dropped out, we would be able to rally around a single person. 


I’m really glad things turned out the way they did, and clearly it was the right choice all along. But I was definitely worried that we were going to be left in a chaotic mess after he did."
2087,"Nah man I was against it as well, I have never been so glad to be so wrong."
2088,"Well, there wasn't really any hint or reason to believe, prior to him dropping out, that the entire party would rally around Kamala in less than 48 hours. I think if the next stop forward had been clear instead of murky AF there would have been much less resistance. Since it turned out so well, it seems like an obvious decision in hindsight but it really didn't feel that way in the middle of July when Biden was saying that only an act of God could make him change his mind."
2089,"There's a quote - ""Never doubt a Democrats ability to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory""

I was extremely hesitant around the idea of Biden stepping down, because it felt like more 'Dems in Disarray' bullshit that we've dealt with for decades. 

But it worked well, and was pretty masterfully executed."
2090,"Dude I and many others would get so much flak for calling for Biden to step down. I cited every poll; I cited historical precedent. I cited the fact that fully 2/3 of Democrats both pre and post Debates did not want Biden. I cited that 75% of the entire electorate thought Joe was too old. We were at rock-bottom and *any* alternate would be better. Was pretty frustrating to encounter cult-like qualities circling around blind loyalty absent of evidence. Then along comes the likes of Alan Lichtman (who vehemently endorsed Hillary only to later predict her loss) and the name-calling and insults picked up. Funny how he also changed his tune immediately. I definitely have renewed respect for those who stuck their necks out to speak truth to power, and *a lot* less respect for others in the party."
2091,"Post-debate it was crazy for anyone to be against him dropping out. He was going to lose and rolling the dice on a different candidate is better than accepting defeat. 

It was also crazy that people wanted to skip over the VP post-primaries and make anyone else the nominee. 

Thankfully logic prevailed on both points."
2092,"> It’s crazy to me that it was such an unpopular opinion around here until he actually made it and then people acted like it was the correct choice all along.

> I was worried before the debate, his age was a huge concern to me (Trump’s too) and that criticism was largely dismissed here.

Preach. The decline was quite obvious before the debate, but people either too blinded to see it or not willing to admit it. There was the videos (like when 60 minutes when they asked how his mental focus was) or I remember reading a Times interview printed pretty much in full and it just made no sense. Plus all the gaff like constantly mixing up and forgetting names, which we used to laugh at Trump about."
2093,Incumbents usually do better. There where I was at. Part of it was denial about how bad Biden was physically. I think the other part is that Harris is legitimately a good candidate running the best campaign since 08 Obama. Arguably better considering the stakes and the unity behind the democratic ticket.
2094,"I was against it because I generally expect democrats on a political level to engage in wide spread infighting rather than any show of unity. I thought that everyone would engage in pushing their preferred candidate and then we'd have a DNC where like in 2016 people are screaming it was stolen from their person who got vastly fewer votes and we'd be heading into an election where everyone hates every one and people looking to settle scores rather than win and govern. I was wrong because after like a week most of the party came together and was down even the VP pick was maybe mildly combative which was an improvement. Outside of the people who are convinced if Biden/Harris just said Ceasefire the horrors in Gaza wouldn't happen people have come together. 

I'm sure there was intense political calculus by the Biden team on how to arrange an exit that worked as well as this did and a lot of political theater that we all saw but I could buy the conspiracy that Biden stayed in long enough to short change a primary before his exit both to make Trump blow his wad attacking him before having to pivot and leave the other candidate a unified party with a few months to sprint to the finish line."
2095,"I'll argue that the whiplash has been good for the Democrats. Too much lead time would have given Putin's GOP the opportunity to tear her down and maximize their interference.

Instead, as orcs flooded into the breach at Helm's Deep, Kamala came tearing down the valley wall, declaring ""We're not going back!"", smashing the Dunlendings and driving the Uruk-hai into the fetid cavities from whence they spawned.

Now, as the Swift army musters for the final battle, it is time for all of us to gird our loins and vote and canvass and donate as if the very life of this democracy is at stake.

Let blow the great horn of Harris-Walz Hammerhand!"
2096,He should have kept to his original promise of only being a one term president.
2097,"Shoulda woulda coulda, if Hillary Clinton had won in 2016, Trump might be in office right now.  I don't know how anyone President during Covid would have been re-elected, it was just too much for everyone.  

Here is what happened after the influenza pandemic of 1918:

Woodrow Wilson did the same thing Trump did, downplayed the pandemic, which cost lots of lives, got sick himself, wanted a third term, but was dumped by his own party, who nominated someone else, who lost to Warren G. Harding, a Republican.

[https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/03/us/woodrow-wilson-coronavirus-trnd/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/03/us/woodrow-wilson-coronavirus-trnd/index.html)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency\_of\_Woodrow\_Wilson#:\~:text=He%20was%20left%20incapacitated%20by,nomination%20for%20a%20third%20term.

We are where we are, and we have a good shot at getting rid of Trump and Trumpism, but it's going to take a lot of work to rehabilitate our Trumper neighbors, friends, employees...  We are going into pretty uncertain times, people may want familiar chaos.  The Democratic party has to offer something that feels secure.  And put it out there in plain English."
2098,"It *was* his decision. All the pressure of all the Pelosis in the world couldn’t legally force his hand if he insisted on the election playing out as it stood. He saw the writing on the wall (huge writing, big black letters), which to be honest is unimaginable if Trump had been in his shoes. "
2099,"""Gray's Political Almanac.  Huh!"""
2100,"Split polls don't work at all. Something about hypotheticals makes people unable to be honest or think clearly on what they want.

When it's Biden vs Trump, how do you like Kamala? Terrible polling.

Once it's actually Kamala vs Trump, polling gets more accurate.

Same way with third party candidates. They always get significantly more support in polls than what they actually get on election day."
2101,"I’m hope scrolling after this debate, not doom scrolling like after the June debate. I love the excitement and optimism. I know there’s still work to do. I donate, check my voter registration, and already made plans A, B, and C on how to get to the polling location and vote. I know when Trump loses, it’s going to be a shitshow. But I can’t help but cautiously grin and be giddy the last couple days."
2102,"My heart fell out when Biden, looking and sounding like a shirnk-wrapped skeleton, stumbled and tried to pick himself back up, then said ""Look: We finally beat medicaid.""

Trump constantly had multiple ""shit the bed"" moments just as bad throughout the debate. It was everything I wanted. To co-opt the lingo of the manosphere, Harris was the alpha in the room, by a lot."
2103,"I think the reason we didn't end up with that clusterfuck is because of the work Harris and Biden did behind the scenes to make sure that the Harris campaign was ready to launch immediately. 

He could have stepped down much earlier and chaos _would_ have ensued. I think they outmanuevered the people calling for Romney or Manchin to be the democratic nominee."
2104,How I felt after Biden v. Trump is probably how MAGA is feeling now -- shell-shocked that I'd hitched my wagon to ... that.
2105,"Yea i actually couldn't finish watching the first debate, it was so rough. The week after I was talking to my parents and sister about how democracy is really on the line and moving to another country should be a real consideration for all of us. 

Second debate i was so nervous but after like 30-40 minutes i was fucking buzzing, so hyped up and having a blast and laughing. I've never seen anyone else do that well in a debate with him and i think Harris might actually have a bit more than a 50% chance of winning now. I also think even if Trump wins the turnout for Harris will be big and have a significant down ballot effect that will make it harder for him to do all the horrible stuff he wants."
2106,Hear hear!
2107,"Biden had it right. This moment — not just Trump — is the battle over the soul of our nation. Who will we be? We’ve changed a lot before, and the current order is too old to hold for long (which is what caused Trumpism, at least in part)."
2108,I got money on Roe v Wade amendment being put up for vote at some point in the semi-near future.
2109,"Yeah people forget in 2020 that Obama made a speech saying this was the most important election of our lifetime. And it was.

And this one is too. It's ridiculous how close democracy is to failing in the US. It wasn't always like this. The closest was probably around the 1928 election when for a minute it looked like huey long might get some power, and he was a wee bit crazy."
2110,He hath blessed us with JD Vance
2111,The challenge with Biden was that he wasn’t winning over independents and soft Republicans.  Harris has pulled those strongly in her favor at least according to polling.
2112,"It was, for better or worse, a specific Biden thing.

Senate Democrats IN THE EXACT SAME POLL would be outrunning him by like 8%, it was crazy.

America is super age-ist and gullible to character assisination."
2113,"I think it is the anti-incumbent sentiment around the world, inflation was blamed on the incumbent thats why Conservatives in UK lost, and thats why Conservatives in Canada will win in a landslide over unpopular Trudeau"
2114,"The 2020 election was far closer than a lot of people like to remember. Biden won Georgia, Wisconsin, and Arizona by less than 1% each and a combined total of 42,918 votes. If he lost all three of those states instead, Trump would have won, and most of the swing states from the last election are still considered toss-ups."
2115,"That is a happy theory. I think more likely there were some people in his orbit who had doubts and the early debate was a put-up-or-shut-up moment for him -- either he proved he was up for it or it left enough time to replace him. I can't see any other reason to ask for the debate before the convention. And if Trump had someone competent around him, maybe they would have asked ""why do they want a debate this early?"" and realized it was a trap. But then again, Trump couldn't possibly fathom someone voluntarily giving up power, so Biden dropping out wasn't something he could consider happening."
2116,"it's really interesting that it felt like theatre, but not because it was theatre but because this is the stuff that goes on in theatre. like, biden fulfilled the positive change character arc of the king: even if the king believes he's the best option for facing the existential threat that the kingdom is under, the king must die (spiritually or physically) and pass the torch to the next generation."
2117,"I think theater goes too far - a likelier thing to me is that it was a test for Biden, that he was onboard with, and knew that if it didn’t go well there was a credible exit after the republican convention that would have the side benefit of totally screwing with the republicans"
2118,"God let the Holocaust happen but wouldn't let Trump get a *second* - not first, but second - term. Got it."
2119,"I've wondered if this was the case too. The timing was just too perfect, and the way they completely nullified all of the Republican efforts attacking someone no longer in the race was a masterstroke. I don't know if there's proof, but if it was accidental, then that was one hell of a good accident."
2120,"All of this. I just said pretty much the same. Except I believe this has been planned years in advance. Not down to every last maneuver, but the intention and overall planning has been in place for the past 4 years. It's exciting to watch and I can't wait to see what's next from them."
2121,"I think its funny that they say that, but without democracy, a republic can easily become a dictatorship. Democracy separates us from dictatorships and oligarchs. Not being pro-democracy is inherently anti-american"
2122,"Not to channel the spirit of Republican ideology, but if Trump wins, this shit was rigged top to bottom."
2123,I am increasingly unsure of the proposition that undecided voters pay attention to job/unemployment reports
2124,Her being a prosecutor with the police brutality protests going on in 2020 was a big issue for her. Now going up against a Felon is making it an asset.
2125,"I got the sense in 2020 that she wasn't quite ready for primetime. I've kept paying attention to her during her time as VP and go the strong impression that she was undergoing an intensive crash course in dealing with global leaders, in liaising with interest groups, particularly unions and teachers, and in honing her ability to debate and give speeches. She really has developed during that time."
2126,"Trying to be in the 2020 primary was just rough for everyone. 

A) It was way too fucking long. 

B) It was way too crowded."
2127,"She's the one who's going to send him to prison or a grave. Personally I think grave. He'll be worm poison probably in the next couple years. Beyond being an amazing and successful prosecutor, I think she's going to surprise us in a lot of pleasant ways. I can't think of anyone better suited for the job in this moment. I believe her 2020 campaign was meant to go the way it did. We're meant to have her right now. The nation needs her and it's her time to shine."
2128,Limping mate lol
2129,Trump still debates and rallies as if he’s running against Biden. He thought he had it in the bag. Get fucked Don.
2130,"My hope is that they've truly exposed that MAGA has no policy.  After Biden dropped out Trump complained that they spent all this money on ads that don't work anymore.  They've been so upset by Biden stepping down because their only debate tactics are ad hominem, they don't have any policy to fall back on."
2131,To be honest I was more afraid that combination of   Racism and sexism would be too much to overcome.  I recall people being interviewed in 2016 just say they would never vote for a woman period.  It’s kinda of amazing that we might have a black woman president before we have a white woman president.
2132,"Yes, but I'd argue she should have been more front and center when looking at her demeanor, capabilities, demographics and the fact Biden has been seen as old, ""lame"" and unpopular since shortly after he was elected. She was basically used for token women and PoC votes then hidden away. To the point where I distinctly remember late night comedians joking she was kidnapped/missing.

I don't recall those jokes about Pence, or Biden."
2133,"It was also a different time. A prosecutor was never going to win a Dem primary in the ""defund the police"" era. It just wasn't her time."
2134,"Right and there were like 20 people running.

Not being someone's first choice in round one doesn't mean people didn't like her.

I know I did."
2135,Very well said. I think that dread isn’t just impractical or imagined as we saw what happened in 2016 when Trump beat Hillary. (I don’t care for her much but obviously she was better than Trump) i think a lot of us were shocked to see the aftermath of decades of conservative strife to divide public opinion come to light in such a horrifying way
2136,"The police there have also come out and said they have no credible evidence of it happening.

His followers talk a big game about respecting the police, but their actions prove over and over they actually don't. It's like their supposed reverence for the military... all lies."
2137,Don’t you dare call his followers Muppets! Muppets are awesome!!! His followers… aren’t.
2138,"And they only even fact checked him on his most absurd, bold faced lies. Kamala had stretched the truth or dodged questions here and there, but every politician does this. Trump said that immigrants are fucking eating dogs and doctors are murdering babies after birth, letting such ridiculous lies go unchecked would be a complete abdication of journalistic duty. Looking at you, CNN…"
2139,These morons probably spend most of their daily energy manually breathing and blinking so it doesnt give em time to think critically
2140,I was fully team Kelly for VP. I was wrong. Threre was no better choice than Walz.
2141,"I wanted Buttigieg as VP and wasn’t enthused about anyone else but Walz’s energy turned me around. I still want to see Pete move higher in the Executive, but Walz was the right pick."
2142,Harris choosing Walz really clinched the deal for me.
2143,"That’s not at all what they did though. Biden’s team gave her the thankless task of a diplomatic effort with Central American countries to curb immigration. Now the GOP can pin the immigration issue on her if they wanted (thankfully Trump was too distracted and stupid to land a punch in the debate). Then they pretty much kept her in the shadows while Biden was in slow decline and becoming less and less visible himself.   

That’s all to say that what Harris is doing is even more impressive, because she had pretty much nothing to work with when Biden stepped aside. Since, she’s run a killer campaign in an obscenely condensed time frame with zero serious mistakes. Give a girl her propers."
2144,"I was for it but I wanted an open mini-primary, I thought it was the only way to engender organic excitement for who came out the other side. I thought Biden dropping out and switching to Kamala would be the worst of both worlds. Never been happier to be wrong, she's met the moment."
2145,"There was immediate unity because of Biden endorsing Kamala Harris. The party bigwigs like Nancy Pelosi were pushing for a contested convention, which would have been bad for the party."
2146,it’s clear they’ve been preparing her for years great job by biden
2147,"Agreed, didn't love the Harris move at first. She wasn't my first choice, she wasn't my fifth choice, but  she has won me over. Now she is my only choice and I am excited to vote for her. What a breath of fresh air, I get to vote for an authentic person who actually  gives a shit. She is confident, competent and classy. She is/will be a great leader."
2148,"Yeah. The division was what worried me. Without the incumbent you were getting more candidates, and more of a party pissing contest.

But they really have rallied around her, as you say."
2149,"That's exactly where I was, and I've never been more happy to have been wrong about something. I know this is still far from over, but damn, this is an exciting time. It feels like 2008 all over again."
2150,"A brain AND a spine, for once."
2151,"You're not wrong that Dems would have eventually rallied if he had been able to hang on. That being said, he would not have been able to campaign at the pace that Harris is capable of doing and there would not have been an influx of fundraising (not to mention none of the excitement and energy that her campaign has created)."
2152,Democrats in ~~dis~~array
2153,"> replacing Biden would have hurt their chances even more than that bad debate

This is just so confusing to me. I don't see how anyone can think we had literally any chance at all after the debate. It was so clear we just needed to replace Biden with just about anyone who was somewhat centrist and younger. Basically we just needed to replace 2024 Biden with 2020 Biden and Trump wouldn't have a chance. But since we can't time travel, that means we had to find some new candidate."
2154,"I’d like to think that’s one thing that distinguishes left from right. 

Well that, and not nominating an insurrectionist rapist."
2155,"Biden stepping aside was always a gamble, but it didn't take a genius to realize it was a situation worth gambling on. I'm just glad it paid off."
2156,"> Nixon Kennedy debate from 1962

From a narcissist who refused to wear makeup to a narcissist who never takes his orange-face off - the clowns change but the GOP circus travels on."
2157,"I also think that it got to the point where people were reactively defending Biden from ridiculous attacks from conservatives that they instinctively started defending him from all criticism.

I saw people here saying that it actually didn't matter if he was in decline because he's surrounded by good people who do all the work anyway. I understand preferring him over Trump, that's a no brainier, but it worried me that many people believed there was any credible alternative to an ageing Biden. 

The party quickly accepting Harris as the nominee was a pleasant surprise because the biggest danger was the party tearing itself in two. The VP pick was spot on too. 

I'm enthused to see people who are excited for Harris to win rather than voting solely based off fearing Trump."
2158,"Yes same here. I do think bidens debate performance was largely due to respiratory illness rather than cognitive decline


But its still clear he didnt have the energy to really do the job 

But I was terrified of infighting sinking the dems. Luckily everything went as well as it possibly could"
2159,"Nobody wants to admit that Biden is arrogant and his hubris almost dragged us into a virtually guaranteed Trump win.  His wing of the party was in overdrive trying to get ahead of his failure at the debate, but the pragmatists in the party finally won out.

But this sub was the subject of some *very* heavy pro-Biden propaganda in that post-debate period.  There are factions in the Democratic party just like the Republican party, and it's very clear that some people *very much* would prefer Biden stay in the race and lose rather than give up power."
2160,"Those of us who were 'against it' were not wrong about holding that opinion, since it was a risky as hell gamble.

It's kind of like betting your last savings on a horse race and winning - even if it worked out, the friends who told you not to place your last money on a gamble weren't giving you bad advice."
2161,"Exactly. It was never that Biden was a good candidate, it was that we were worried that everything would spiral into infighting. Which we have a lot of precedent to show. The ""Bernie or Bust"" thing could have sunk this election too."
2162,"I absolutely felt that way and was saying it loudly. I didn't know if the nomination process would be easy or hard, I just knew that running Biden was a much bigger risk and we desperately needed some sort of course correction. 

I'm not accepting that this is only being said in hindsight when I was clearly saying it for a long time before the debate and when he dropped out. Far too many voters weren't happy with the choice they were being given by the Democrats and that was only going to play into Trump's hands."
2163,Yea. Nobody believed they could come together like they did. Faster and more seamless than even the most optimistic people thought it would happen.
2164,"There’s a lot of democrats with a cult-like mentality that get really defensive the moment you call out or criticize any of the major figures like Biden, Hillary, Pelosi or Obama no matter how nuanced you try to be."
2165,"I mean he did, but he also made it impossible to hold an open primary."
2166,Holy shit are we in the “Doc Brown Commended” timeline now?!
2167,"Also, I think people were genuinely surprised by how good Harris came across after she launched her campaign. I was surprised, anyway. Maybe my memory is just shit, but I don't remember her being this compelling in the 2020 season."
2168,"I remember getting a couple of those polls pre-Biden dropping out and being soooo annoyed at the time by what I perceived to be party flakiness (and suspicion about who was running the polls), that I kept answering “no” to the suggestion of Kamala vs Trump."
2169,hope scrolling!
2170,"I’ve been hope scrolling since July 21, the day Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris (and also my cake day)

After this debate, I’m gonna hope scroll even HARDER"
2171,"Yep, /r/politics is no longer somewhere I dread visiting. TBH, I do still dread it a little, because nothing is assured yet ... I wish I could vote for Harris, I wish I could donate to her campaign. My cousin married an American, I'm sure she's doing exactly that."
2172,"Yeah. Trump gave basically the same performance against Harris as Biden.  He just shouted his disconnect from reality just as loud both times.  

Harris was just so much better and lively Trump looked like an idiot this time. "
2173,This. They've planning this since he asked her to be his running mate in 2020. They have surrounded themselves with brilliant people who know how to play the long game. I'm beyond impressed with how it all played out.
2174,It will be fascinating reading about how it all happened behind the scenes once the insiders start writing their tell-alls. The timing of the eventual decision and all of the drama leading up to it all seemed to be well orchestrated (in retrospect). Waiting for the RNC to finish before dropping the bomb was amazing.
2175,Wendover Productions had a good video explaining the logistics of a presidential run using the transition from Biden to Harris as the prime example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj8lwyWKpa4
2176,JD Vance introduced the Cat and Dog concept that Trump is now encumbered with.
2177,"Go forth and show them how erroneous thy ways are. 

Your burden, my son, is to be an incelleous man for all to see."
2178,"America is ageist, but I think it's fair to expect our government to not be run by people who are a decade and a half past the average retirement age.


Age comes for us all, and when my 80s come for me, I damn sure don't want access to nukes. "
2179,I really feel like this is how it truly went down. I'm sure books will be written about it by those behind the scenes in years to come.
2180,Kopmala absolutely killed her in 2020
2181,She's clearly gained a huge wealth of experience as Biden's VP. For three years she's been constantly at the ready to take over the job should something happen to him. Now she's showing it
2182,"Good to hear. Especially with how quickly she got the support of other politicians. There's some quotes in the article that are not good to hear like underestimating how people wanted more confidence in a President or how even talking about replacing Biden was getting shut down. 

I hope Kamala is a planer and likes to be prepared and has been taking notes. Because it seems like that is the case and she has been making some good key decisions since Biden dropped out.

99% of the job is a willingness to help improve the daily lives of people living in America. But that other 1% that Kamala also seems to have is becoming more obvious. We have a chance to have a Democrat in the White House for 12 years and I think Kamala knows how important this is. “Same old, tired playbook. Next question, please.”"
2183,"Kamala might be the only opponent Trump could not nail a nickname on like ""Sleepy Joe"" - he will say ""Marxist Kamala"" or ""Comrade Kamala"" and it is so generic Republican rhetoric to call anyone even remotely liberal a communist that is laughable."
2184,"yup, they only believe what they’re told to believe….would feel sorry for them, but since they’re all so toxic they can fuck themselves"
2185,"It's just like how they cry about being pro-life and ""for the children,"" but don't actually do anything to actually help them. In fact, they actively do things to make life harder for them."
2186,"[Heck even the governor, *from the same party I might add*, is saying the claims aren’t credible.](https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Politics/ohios-gop-governor-dispels-republican-claims-haitian-migrants/story?id=113622189)"
2187,I think they only fact checked him on lies that they EXPECTED him to say.
2188,"But don’t worry, because those illegal aliens are getting sex changes after they’re arrested. But I thought sex changes were bad? But is it good when it’s punishment? Thank heavens he has the concept of a plan"
2189,"I think Buttigieg's time will come. 

Unfortunately, I'm just not sure in 2024 America is ready to have someone who is openly LGBT+ in the whitehouse. We're barely ready for a black woman."
2190,"Totally. I cannot believe how much we underestimated her. 

The day Biden dropped out and endorsed her, this sub's megathread was full of comments like, ""he endorsed HER?"" ""she's such an unpopular VP,"" ""I want (xyz) to run.."" Xyz = Whitmer, Pete, etc. 

Harris has blown everyone away. 

I have to admit I continued to underestimate her even after she accomplished A LOT. I wasn't sure she would win the debate.

I have never been so happy to be so wrong."
2191,"It is the same task Obama gave Biden though. I can see a reality where Biden didn't realize how unfair the press would be with her, when they never mentioned him at all when he did it."
2192,"Yup. If we go down, we went down motherfucking swinging hard."
2193,Biden tasked her with critical foreign policy. She was also tasked with going to Ukraine and meeting our NATO allies before and during the ongoing war. She clearly asked him to expand her foreign policy portfolio because it was the area she had no experience in. I think Biden supported and utilized Kamala is the exact right way to prepare her for the Presidency.
2194,"That’s what the VP is for.  They’re the queen on the chessboard you can move around to show which problems you’re taking most seriously.  They didn’t keep her in the shadows it’s just nobody cares what the vp is doing.  They also gave her abortion advocacy which is how she became acquainted with Walt and her strongest issue.  They complement each other pretty well actually, not just in identity. "
2195," It’s kind of wild how quickly the narrative shifted around Harris once she got the spotlight. I really didn’t expect her to handle it so well after the way things went down in 2020. Now, seeing her do her thing feels like there’s a real chance for some positive change. Guess that just goes to show how a strong candidate can bring people together. Let’s see where this leads us."
2196,Flip side keeping her under wraps also kept her off the right wing radar and out of the sights. Elevating her during the bulk of the term would have also put her squarely in the cross hairs leading up to the eventual dropout of Biden. Instead Trump and the right were caught flat footed and dumbfounded. Now scrambling to make something stick.
2197,"The thing is, Republicans were going to pin immigration on her no matter what.  There could be 1 illegal crossing per day, they're going to stoke fear using an outgroup.  The truth doesn't matter.

The Biden admin achieved results Trump didn't.  Under international law you cannot deport someone unless the receiving country accepts them.  The Biden admin got Mexico to accept deportees that aren't from Mexico.  They also got Mexico to step up enforcement of their own borders to prevent pass through.

They've also managed to reduce the influx from the usual northern triangle countries.  Mind you Trump cut off aid funding to those countries which exasperated social issues which increased the flow.  The main driver now is Venezuela.  Don't know what the exact plan Harris has for this, but I can guess Trump's won't be better.

Not even getting into how Trump torpedo'd the border bill.  Frankly, Democrats should be pounding this on the news over and over.  It's just another thing like the economy that somehow Republicans get to claim being better at in spite of there being no quantifiable reason for that other than they said so repeatedly."
2198,"The thankless tasks are often the most important, and I think it speaks to both the trust Biden has in Kamala and her character for continuing to address this major issue."
2199,She had a lot of success doing that thankless job regardless of the propaganda.  Maybe Trump shouldn't have killed that bill if he was so concerned about the border.
2200,"Yeah I hear that for sure. I’ve been thinking about what that process would look like at a normal job. You get pulled into the inner circle of decision makers even if they aren’t asking you for direct input, but you are expected to be absorbing absolutely everything that goes on. Then over time you start making observations and bring points up as you grow comfortable with the details of a given situation. You have to gain trust and experience over time and then there will always be a jumping point when it’s time to shine. If you fall down on that first big assignment things can go poorly and confidence can be lost. It seems like that has not happened due to Kamala’s dedication to being the most prepared person in the room but I also assume that there’s leadership from Biden or others to help bolster Kamala and guide her along the path based on how well she’s moved into the new role and carried the workload. 

If she’s truly not gotten that guidance from anyone in the White House and still hit the ground running since stepping into the Nomination the GOT DAMN, we’ve got a once in a life time leader in Harris. I have to believe she’s got mentors and guidance because smart people like Kamala build that network around them for a moment just like this. Either way she’s doing the work and stepping up for her country and that’s amazing to see. 

If people are still underestimating her, it seems that will be to their detriment."
2201,Except by all measures she *succeeded* in the effort with central american countries. Immigration from those countries is down over where it was before 2021.
2202,"To be fair though, it introduced her to one of the most important regions for the United States. She also did pretty well in[ reducing the flow of some immigration to the US](https://apnews.com/article/harris-migration-border-el-salvador-guatemala-honduras-60bf6703ede25a177b06c1baed34e5fb), particularly from places like El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala by focusing on getting foreign investment to flow to these countries as a way to reduce the rationale for their populations to want to come here. It was a long term project, not something that would be a short term, quick fix, and it looks like she actually did some good.

Biden gave her a foreign policy portfolio away from more troublesome regions like Europe, Africa, the Middle East & Asia that would also have bearing on domestic policy. From all accounts, she performed her role well, and was also involved in helping to form the coalition to support Ukraine, so it wasn't like she was pigeon holed like some VPs have been in the past.

Before becoming VP, she had practically no foreign policy experience, but she had dealt with transnational organized crime coming from Latin America (as AG for California). So, it likely seemed like a good place for her to start."
2203,"Yes. I was in the same camp. Fight it out in the primaries, and Unite behind the candidate. But what they did is probably fight it out behind the curtains and present a united block. Probably smarter with low time."
2204,"Meanwhile, I was horrified by the idea of a mini-primary, mainly because I thought the media would turn it into a reality-show-level festival of drama. SO glad that didn't happen. I truly think Biden and Harris knew what they were doing. IMO, Harris has probably been holding back letting Joe run the show simply because she was the VP, but now she's also the candidate, she gets to really shine and go full bore showing what she's capable of."
2205,"> Never been happier to be wrong, she's met the moment.

She was basically in the GOP's blind spot and they didn't even bother to give her a little bit of the ol' Hillary treatment just in case this fairly obvious outcome happened.  So when she suddenly came into focus, people were clamoring to learn about her and see her in action: they were not poisoned against her.  The GOP is trying to do that now, and it's way too late.

And yes, she has absolutely met the moment and then some.  It eased a lot of people's minds."
2206,"I actually think a huge amount of the credit goes to AOC. She very shrewdly strongly supported Biden staying in, but immediately flipped to Kamala when he dropped out. AOC is arguably the strongest communicator of progressive caucus in the Democratic party, and once you had the leader of the establishment (Biden), and the leader of the progressives (AOC), there really was no chance for anyone else to break through in the relatively short time to the convention. It was over as soon as it started.

The nightmare scenario for the Democrats was putting up an establishment candidate like Harris, and then the progressive wing latching on to someone else leading to a fracture in the party that would have been resolved behind closed doors. Would have been okay during a primary where there was voting on who to pick, but it would have been a disaster to happen in Chicago.

Makes me think that AOC knew what she was doing when she came out so strong for keeping Biden after the debate. AOC is certainly thrilled that a woman of colour is representing the Democratic party at the top of the ticket for the first time."
2207,Do you have a source/link that Pelosi wanted a contested convention? Everything I've read has made it sound like she was all in on Kamala being the nominee and not creating an inter-party fight.
2208,"Yup. Biden knew exactly what was at stake and made the decision for the party. He told everyone “Harris is your candidate” and that was that. If other party bigwigs wanted to contest it, the IMMEDIATE outpouring of support, enthusiasm, and donations pretty much shut that down. Within 24 hours Harris was the face of party unity. It’s really incredible to have watched. "
2209,"You have to hand it to Biden and his team, Harris was a great choice for VP, but the professionalism and dedication of the team on every level from Biden down to the campaign volunteers have made for such a smooth transition.

It's a thing of beauty, something I would say for this administration in general."
2210,"She was the only choice. 81 million people voted for a ticket that included her, with the intent that she would step up if Biden had to step down.

Well, Biden stepped down, so she stepped up.

And I guarantee you the same people who complained that ""no one voted for her to be the candidate"" would be dead against a special Republican Primary election if Trump were to die between now and election day."
2211,"I think Kamala was a good pick, but I have developed a man crush on Walz."
2212,"She's a great candidate I've been excited about her since 2020. I wanted her to run since she did Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing


Its been clear that her wit, no nonsense attitude, and cutting humor are the exact response we've needed to combat Trump."
2213,I am not in love with Harris as a candidate.  But she’s a very good candidate and lots of other people love her.  That’s enough to get me energized.
2214,"this should be talked about more often. Democrats get things wrong all of the time...but when we do, we rethink it and change course. MAGA republicans, literally dead opposite."
2215,"Nixon sweated buckets, squirmed, looked like he was caught red handed stealing candy from a preacher.  That was that for that election.  I think he actually came across worse than Trump.  Trump looks crazy, addle brained and obviously sick.  I think it's going to take a while for the 'She is Joe Biden' ending remark to soak in.    Nixon looked mean, nasty and like he was caught lying."
2216,"I've been kind of irrationally defending him from criticism. A lot of 2016 and 2020 Democrats were Their Own Worst Enemy on repeating conservative and Russian propaganda attacks against Democratic candidates and only hurting their own cause


I was deeply afraid that perpetuating criticism against biden would help keep undecided voters at home


Criticism is necessary but we must be careful that our criticisms arent used to turn pptential off voters that we need"
2217,">Those of us who were 'against it' were not wrong about holding that opinion, since it was a risky as hell gamble.

It's okay to admit you were wrong about something. Everyone gets things wrong.

>It's kind of like betting your last savings on a horse race and winning - even if it worked out, the friends who told you not to place your last money on a gamble weren't giving you bad advice.

After the debate Biden was not going to win. This was more like you bet on a horse but then found out he was injured. You were then offered an opportunity to change your bet to another horse.

The injured horse isn't going to win so you should change your bet and try your luck with another horse who at least has a chance of winning."
2218,Thats true and I feel even better than when i woke up this morning and concluded I was not JD Vance.
2219,"Well, you can accept that other people felt differently than you or not."
2220,"I will never watch Morning Joe again when their literal first question to Joe Biden's softball call-in to MSNBC was:

>I'm curious. There's a part of [your letter] where you talk about the fact that you got 14 million votes, 87% of the vote, it was an open process, you only had 3 people running against you, you had 3900 delegates, and then you asked this question, 'do we now just say that the process didn't matter? That the voters didn't have a say?' — **I'm curious, is that an allusion also to Donald Trump and the fact that Democrats, you believe, may now be doing the same thing that Donald trump tried to do in 2020, and that is overthrow the popular will of Democratic voters?**

Fucker literally tried to equate January 6th with calls for Biden to voluntarily step-down in lieu of 2/3 of Democrats not wanting him in. Not that I watched much Morning Joe before, but this was unforgiveable."
2221,"Whenever I feel like I need a good downvoting, I point out the very obvious shortcomings of Pelosi. It works every time."
2222,"Blue MAGA was at its worst right before Biden stepped down.  Outright reality denial.  Getting *real* vicious with anybody on this sub who *dared* suggest that Biden needed to step aside.  It was funny in a way, and it made pretty clear just how much this sub is run by bots."
2223,"Which, speaking only in strategic terms, may have been the right move. At the moment, anyone who wanted to beat Trump had to go with Kamala. And then she laid out a vision that made people want to vote *for* her, not just against him."
2224,Would love to see Trump crash his golf cart into a greenskeeper’s cart of organic fertilizer. 
2225,"Yeah she was not a good candidate in 2020.

She must have really grown into her role as VP"
2226,"This will be my first presidential election where I’m eligible to vote as a new U.S. citizen. I felt so hopeless back in 2020 when I couldn’t vote yet, and relieved that Biden won then. Now I’ll have a voice. Your thoughts count. Even though you can’t vote, I feel the support from people here and abroad and it reenergizes me. Thank you!"
2227,"Supposedly he really didn't make the decision until the Saturday night before he dropped out, when his closest advisors showed him internal swing state polls and told him there was no path forward. But I also eagerly await the behind-the-scenes books."
2228,I know Jill’s the teacher of the family but Joe ain’t too shabby himself. Between the help I’m sure he provided Obama and his tutelage of Harris while she was VP. His impact in politics over the past 20 years is even more impressive when you look beneath the surface.
2229,I say this all the time in my arguments when I call them pro birth bc they don't give af once it draws its first breath.
2230,"I actually think America is ready now for an LGB President (but not T yet). Yes, there are pockets of the GOP that think gays want to plunge America into hellfire, but they were never going to vote for any Democrat nominee. Upwards of 70% of Americans believe that same-same marriage should be legal, it's frankly amazing how much of a consensus has been built over the last decade or so.

I'm old enough to remember people saying that America isn't ready to have a black President. They said that right up until Obama won the election. Some people even said America would never be ready. And now we're on the cusp of having our second."
2231,"The problem is people were judging her based on limited history and information. They hadn't seen her improvements over the last 3 years at messaging and public speaking. They also unfairly based too much on her 2020 primary loss without looking at the situation and context of the time, and how it's different today."
2232,"> The day Biden dropped out and endorsed her, this sub's megathread was full of comments like, ""he endorsed HER?"" ""she's such an unpopular VP,"" ""I want (xyz) to run.."" Xyz = Whitmer, Pete, etc. 

Really what I was most surprised by that day was how pretty much the entirety of Democratic leadership and everyone who might have challenged her in a floor fight or condensed primary, all came out and endorsed her instead."
2233,"I did not. I knew in 2020 she would make a great President, and was sharp and intelligent and caring. I have never understood this narrative -- often from both sides of the aisle -- that she is stupid, inarticulate, lazy, etc. It's not true. Not one thing in her entire life points to her being stupid, lazy, or inarticulate."
2234,Well you can thank Obama for that HE stepped in and mentored her and made put her in the seat… Joe even made a statement about it saying he thinks it was his plan from the jump.
2235,"She was never actually unpopular. People just parrot things. Her polling was low because Biden supporters wanted to indicate that they wanted him and didn't want her shining or being pushed. As soon as it was obvious Biden needed to go...nobody could remember why they disapproved of Harris in the first place. 

These last few years people have just been over protective of Biden because they thought he would be running again. As soon as he stepped down everyone congratulated him and most said it was a great decision...just days before the same people were adamant that there was nothing wrong with him running."
2236,"This ….

People suddenly have some high expectations for a VP. I think it’s because we lived through dick Cheney. But that dude put himself there and we know why. 

Vice presidents aren’t supposed to be out front doing shit. Usually, a First Lady’s programs get more attention!

The hardest thing for me to hear is some proudly ignorant moron go on a rant about “if she’s so good, why didn’t she do this the last three years.”"
2237,"Keep in mind that the plan (assuming there was one) was for her to learn under a second term. I have no doubt that she would be more out in front during the planned second Biden term, but the debate was so much of a disaster that they had to pivot."
2238,"Biden was the most visible VP i can remember since Al Gore. He was constantly with Obama in photos and videos and talking to the press. They talked about how they were basically best friends in interviews. It felt like the Obama administration really promoted him and leaned on him way more. Of course, he's one of the most experienced politicians in US history and he was serving with one of the least experienced politicians to become president in recent history. So I get why, Biden needed less from Harris than Obama did from Biden. 

But still, i don't see their situations as that comparable, i do think that the Biden administration could have done a lot more to get here out there and give her some projects that were more of a slam dunk to promote her. She felt pretty hidden away."
2239,"Good point. And Biden was picked for his foreign policy chops and his decades of working with senators, often from a committee chairman position. He would have been ready on day one if needed and maybe he took for granted the elevated position of VP."
2240,"Honestly the fact that all the major potential candidates came out speaking up for her made everything SUCH a quick turnaround, and you can see how much the people appreciated and respected them for it. I got chills when Elizabeth Warren walked out at the DNC and started to tear up at the raucous applause and standing ovation."
2241,"It's a very important task. Almost everyone agrees that unrestricted immigration is not healthy for the country, it's just that democrats aren't bloodthirsty and racist about it."
2242,"Check out Ezra Klein interview with her on YouTube.

https://youtu.be/3x-zOAfP0MA?si=n3LK3UdJF-3eQChS"
2243,"> And I guarantee you the same people who complained that ""no one voted for her to be the candidate"" would be dead against a special Republican Primary election if Trump were to die between now and election day.  

Would they? Everyone hates JD, including Trump. I'd assume they'd jump at the chance to put literally anyone else on the ballot."
2244,"> 81 million people voted for a ticket that included her,

This is such nonsense though. Being included on the ticket is in no way the same as people voting for her as President. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy with how things are turning out and I think she'll be a fine President (where fine = continuing some sense of normalcy after Biden). But come on...we never voted for, or against, her as our candidate."
2245,"As a Minnesotan, my only regret is that we have to lose him as our governor."
2246,"Her staffers are also reporting that she's an extremely hard worker, always extremely prepared, decisive, has high standards for those who work for her, etc. Qualities you want in a president..look at how prepared she was for the debate.."
2247,"> she’s a very good candidate

this is high praise.  and deserved"
2248,">I've been kind of irrationally defending him from criticism.

Honestly I feel like this kind of defense ends up turning off more potential voters than the actual criticism"
2249," Yeah - this was definitely true in my case. I assumed she was the 2020 Harris - turns out she's grown tremendously since then.

 Now we get to see if our candidate actually matters or if Trump manages to use the darkness inside our fellow Americans to once again drag us backwards - no matter who our candidate is, or how inspiring she is."
2250,"You could see it in the case of Pelosi though, she had talks with Biden and they both agreed they wouldn't go through with it UNLESS absolutely everyone was on board. I felt like Pelosi would have personally strangled Newsom or anyone else that had the gall to run against Kamala."
2251,"And Biden beat everyone to it. I think that can't be understated. As soon as he stepped down and endorsed her, if anyone else stood up it would have split the party apart. And to Kamala's credit, she shifted gears and dropped the pedal to the metal."
2252,"I never thought she was stupid, lazy or inarticulate.

The only reason I thought she might lose the debate is because we've been through this with Trump before. We think he's going to lose because he's a rambling, mumbling unhinged person, but he talks the most and loudest and that gives the impression that he ""won.""

Little did we know. Even though he talked for 6.5 more minutes than her (!!!!) she destroyed him. 

He has met more than his match. That's why he's coward-ing out of another debate."
2253,"> nobody could remember why they disapproved of Harris in the first place 

This is so true."
2254,Yep. The VP spot used to be a dead-end where ambitious potential rivals (Theodore Roosevelt the clearest example) get put on ice without a ton to do and with only a hope of rising to the presidency.
2255,"Die hard GOP fans are wondering why Kamala as VP didn’t convince Biden to invade a Middle East country, kill a million people, and try and establish a friendly democracy…….oops, I mean a Republic."
2256,"There was an understanding Biden would only run once. The midterms gave him thought that he should run again, but that blew up. Harris was a good pick but as VP basically nobody heard about her for most of the term. That’s kind of the nature of the job though, a prominent VP like Biden or Cheney is kind of an abnormality in American politics"
2257,There was only one vice president between Gore and Biden
2258,">But still, i don't see their situations as that comparable, i do think that the Biden administration could have done a lot more to get here out there and give her some projects that were more of a slam dunk to promote her. She felt pretty hidden away.

A lot of the stuff she was doing was actually important and impressive, but happening in the background. 

Like, the prisoner swap with Russia? She was the one doing the negotiating with our allies and getting the prisoners Putin wanted released in exchange for the ones we wanted."
2259,"Since Dick Cheney is voting for Kamala, it confirms that Trump is an existential threat to our constitutional order. And that it is NOT a hyperbole. Given that, this election should tell us who is for the country and who is for the orange man. There are NO 'ifs and buts' about it after this debate."
2260,"I was very much in the bernie sanders camp in 2016, and did not appreciate the DNC at all in that time. The atmosphere was very hostile, and I think they probably learned a lesson from it. Embrace eachother, rather than demonise. 

I will still get mad every time I hear the clips/excerpts from her book where Hillary blames Sanders for her loss in the election. She did/does not seem capable to unite people behind her because I still feel she thinks she was owed a presidency. 

Kamala however managed to unite progressives and more central laying democrats."
2261,"That Sunday morning, after Biden dropped his statement, I was like he didn't mention Harris, we are fucked. Then within an hour he did. Then Patty Murray, then the Clintons, and then fundraising links and fundraisers started. And I was like YES!

It was one of the few times Pelosi did not get what she wanted ie a mini primary. I personally think she wanted Newsom."
2262,That’s an hour and my lunch is 30 min. Time stamp to the relevant part?
2263,Ehhh wouldnt it be more like if mike pence was still around (if he hadnt tried to kill him)
2264,"What should have happened instead? A new primary with debates to pick a new candidate? Rushed campaigns? Special elections in 50 states? Missed ballot deadlines, meaning the Democratic candidate isn't actually on the ballot?

The delegates we voted for couldn't vote for Biden anymore, so they went with who they thought was the best choice."
2265,"Given Biden's age everyone who isn't stupid voted with the implicit understanding that Kamala might become Biden's immediate successor.

Doubly so those of us who actually voted in the primaries this year. All of us voting for Biden knew that he might not even finish out this term, much less four more years. We made our peace with it. 

Folks who didn't vote for Biden in the dem primary this year have no right to speak about how we never voted for Kamala. Her name wasn't on the ballot, but everyone involved knew that Biden and Harris were a package deal."
2266,Yep I had no doubt that she is intelligent and well studied and prepared just from hearing her speak.  I am so excited for her to be prez
2267,"> You could see it in the case of Pelosi though, she had talks with Biden and they both agreed they wouldn't go through with it UNLESS absolutely everyone was on board. I felt like Pelosi would have personally strangled Newsom or anyone else that had the gall to run against Kamala.

I believe there was conversation beforehand about her looking for a contested floor fight at the convention, or a condensed primary.  I think however she quickly saw the writing on the wall once Biden came out and endorsed Harris."
2268,"> There was an understanding Biden would only run once.

There was never an explicit understanding of this. It was always media speculation or cope by people for whom Biden was not their first choice. Biden called himself a bridge candidate, which is hardly definitive, and some unnamed staffer in 2019 tried to gauge national interest while Biden was trailing Bernie by telling Politico Biden was considering such a promise, which just never actually happened and couldn't be corroborated."
2269,"To be fair, were any of us in her shoes, I think we'd feel that we were ""owed"" that presidency, given who she was running against. Who ever would have thought that a rapist with zero political experience would win over someone who has one of the most polished political records of our time?"
2270,"I feel the same about Hillary.  I was pretty annoyed to see her give a speech at the convention, but what can you do? To say she has sway with the DNC is an understatement.  Still,  I would have hoped she has the presence of mind to realize that injecting herself into the moment is not helpful. But nope."
2271,"Hillary and Joe are from an America and a political landscape that hasn't existed in 12 years.  Nancy Pelosi and Obama seem to have been the ones actually working behind the scenes to develop the new generation and new class of Democratic leadership in the pipeline.  Kamala killed it by making 100 calls to consolidate support as soon as Joe dropped out, but I think the younger generation of politicians (Whitmer, Pete, Shapiro, Polis, Tim Walz coming out of nowhere, etc) locking elbows and forming a Dem Avengers team that immediately supported Kamala was a huge difference maker.  Country over party, and over self.  We're going to be in good hands for a long time if Kamala wins."
2272,Watch it at 2x speed!
2273,"Exactly. 

What happened *is* the predetermined process. Voting in the primary = voting for a slate of delegates to represent you at at the convention. Those delegates aren't legally bound to vote for their pledged candidate if certain conditions are met. Those conditions were met. This outcome followed the rule of law. 

Where is the authority or precedent for essentially re-running the primaries? I've not seen a good (legal) argument for that, and that's without getting into any equitable concerns."
2274,"I don't buy this either, because I voted AGAINST Trump first and foremost. I didn't choose Kamala.

And don't even mention the ""primaries"" this year. There were no ""primaries"" this year.

And again, don't get me wrong. I'm ok with where we're at now and am kind of excited for a Kamala presidency. But I don't like when people pretend that we chose her when we didn't."
2275,From your keyboard to the universe's eyes.
2276,Thanks for stating this.  So much rewriting of history going on.
2277,I don’t think we needed it said that a 80 year old won’t try to run for another term
2278,">Biden called himself a bridge candidate, which is hardly definitive. 

Excuse me, but what else could a “bridge candidate” possibly mean? 

Don’t try gaslight people. Biden stepping aside after one term was one of his selling points in 2020. Of course it was not explicitly part of his campaign because that would have weakened the ticket further, but it was definitely implicit among Democrats selling Biden to the left."
2279,"I don't specifically mean in that 2016 election. Even from before when she was beaten in the primaries by Obama. She ran against Obama as long as Bernie did versus her, yet she was mad about it. 

It always felt to me like she wanted to have the legacy of being the first female president, and thought she could leverage that. However I never really liked Hillary though. So that's not helping my analysis."
2280,"A lot of older women love and needed to hear from Hillary. I get that she’s not beloved with everyone gen x and under, but she is a step in the story that I hope finishes this November."
2281,"I *could* see the argument for a new candidate if it was an elected government position. But, you know. It's not.

Most people complaining are Republicans who support the Electoral College which has the exact same feature."
2282,"Yeah, I was not thrilled that she was the VP pick in 2020 even though it was a very predictable move. And she wasn't my preference in July, though I was willing to take a chance on her over Biden after the debate. But she won me over after Biden dropped starting with her statement that she intended to ""earn and win"" the nomination, and it's been clear ever since that she's grown a lot as a candidate, so I'm happy to support her."
2283,"Pelosi and Biden didn't see eye to eye either. When Pelosi got all the donors to meet and unify, she basically held all the cards to make the change. I am certain deals were made, but the goal is to win and Kamala is changing her stances to align with the County.  Keep in mind, its her stances on issues, not her values being changed here."
2284,Trump is 78 so apparently we do lol
2285,"A bridge is a construct connecting one piece of land to another. A bridge candidate, we can infer, is connecting or transitioning from one era to another. There's no timeline inherent to it. Assigning one is on you. 

You differentiate yourself from what was explicit and what was implicit. It's not ""gaslighting"" to say Biden's campaign never made the promise that he would only run for one term. If you want to blame him for anything, it could be that he never really addressed it. Was such a promise actually implied or were you just hearing what you wanted to?"
2286,"There's also one really old man who we needed to hear from Hillary. One really old, weird, shitty man who gets distracted by the people he hates."
2287,"This. Speaking as a genX woman myself, what I think was important was for Hillary to show she had Kamala's back, not in the least to stave off any rumors of jealousy or bad blood that would surely have circulated had she NOT spoken at the DNC."
2288,"Fair point.  Great username, by the way."

2297,"> That tally, shared by the Harris campaign with The New York Times, included donations from 600,000 people. It is her largest 24-hour fund-raising period since an initial burst of donations when she entered the race in July and raised $81 million on the first day."
2298,"Spend it on winning the Senate. Judges should be top priority. Hopefully a couple SC appointments. Maybe if Trump takes a decent beating in the election, the ones who fly American flags upside down or own a six figure motor home paid for by someone frequently before the court, will retire."
2299,"I'm not surprised.  After she outperformed expectations and trump did so abysmally while propagating racist lies (that as it tuns out, were started by literal neo-nazis) it has motivated a lot of people to contribute.

Also: Any overflow cash the Kamala campaign does not need is going to other downballot races."
2300,This woman is swimming in cash
2301,At what point in a campaign does money not help?
2302,"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/us/politics/harris-debate-donations.html) reduced by 49%. (I'm a bot)
*****
> Vice President Kamala Harris raised $47 million in the first 24 hours following her debate with former President Donald J. Trump on Tuesday night, a sum that will likely expand a widening funding gap between the two campaigns.

> Her operation said it had $404 million cash on hand, while Mr. Trump had $295 million.

> Presidential debates often become fund-raising bonanzas because of their audience: 67 million people watched Tuesday&#039;s contest live, not including likely millions more watching on a variety of websites and streaming platforms.

2309,Spend it on paid canvassers to GOTV.
2310,"Probably never. She can transfer money [down-ballot if she hits diminishing returns, as she's done recently.](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/03/harris-campaign-down-ballot-spending-00177075) There does come a point where you've saturated the web and air space and you and Trump can't really buy anymore."
2311,"There's no such point. There are down ballot races, but there are also states that could *in theory* flip, like Florida or Texas. It's unlikely but if you've already covered the swing states and have extra money, why not air some ads there."
2312,down ballot is super important
2313,"Hey now, this will very likely result in the end of his presidency!"
2314,"I haven't seen any figures, yet. He only took in about 130 million in August, so I doubt his donors gave him remarkable amounts money after his performance in the debate."

2316,"Key points:

- 71% of grassroots donations during the first hour of the debate came from WOMEN

- driven by grassroots donors: 600,000 individuals donated (!!!)

- this is just the beginning push, we need to push all the way to the end

TL;DR: high enthusiasm, keep donating (if you are in the financial situation to), vote, make sure other Harris supporters in your lives vote. 🇺🇸"
2317,“The Harris campaign raised $361 million in August and had $404 million cash on hand at the end of the month.” That’s a lotta cheese. I hope they spend it in more than just the tight races.
2318,Amateur. Trump embezzles that much in 12 hours.
2319,"My tipping point for a donation was when Trump *refused* to provide a Yes/No answer, despite being prompted multiple times - and then they just let him get away with it."
2320,Dropped her $100 when she mentioned the crowd size 😆
2321,"Is that good? /s

Also, I know lots of these were grassroots/small donations, but we **really** need publicly funded elections if we want to start righting the ship in the US."
2322,They kept texting me during the debate
2323,Okay serious question how much money have they raised since Kamala took over cause it feels like its literally a billion dollars at this point.
2324,"47, which incidentally is the number president she'll be when she wins in November."
2325,47 you say? Love that number ☺️
2326,I donated. Let’s win this!
2327,"Wow, imagine if she won the debate! /s"
2328,[deleted]
2329,But guys that’s all because she lost
2330,Can I borrow a little to help with my medical school debt lol 😂
2331,"I just donated, cause she’s my next president 👍"
2332,Trump raised 47 million grievances in 24 hours!
2333,I wonder how much Trump’s campaign raised
2334,She has to be at a billion now.
2335,"Happy to have donated as a woman voter. In fact, I get to cast my first vote in a presidential election this year!"
2336,"71% women makes sense. Her abortion answer was so damn powerful. Watching it I knew that was the moment that would speak to women. It was so damn obvious to have a woman speak on reproductive rights and it is just spot on. She has had that experience. Maybe had an abortion or pregnancy scare. She has walked in their shoes. I can’t speak to that, all I can say is that forced birth is morally wrong and it should be between a woman and her doctor to decide what’s best. "
2337,"For the first time in a long time I'm actually looking forward to voting for someone instead of solely against someone.

I might not agree with a lot of Harris' stances (I'm far more toward the democratic socialist side of the spectrum) but she's well spoken, has a solid plan would be a first in American history and not going to sell out Ukraine."
2338,It would be fantastic if Harris would distribute another $25 million to the Democrats in charge of the house elections and Senate elections as well as state legislatures and below. Those dollars will go much further than expensive ad time on the crowded airwaves of the few swing states.
2339,"This is the way. Infectious enthusiasm directed towards mobilizing the vote to preserve and expand our freedoms! 

Thanks to everyone for donating and volunteering!! 🇺🇸"
2340,Do they have figures for how many of the contributors were first time contributors?
2341, That's a solid breakdown. It's interesting to see how grassroots momentum can translate into significant funding. It’s wild how much enthusiasm can shift the financial landscape of a campaign. Just goes to show the power of collective action when people feel motivated.
2342,yeah diminishing returns at some point the airwaves are probably flooded already. they already spread out some and they even sent some down ballot.
2343,"So that is how he became a billionaire, sweet."
2344,Honestly I would just be happy with repealing Citizens United for now. Let campaign be exclusively funded by grassroots donations.
2345,Same. All those text messages I just block. I’m never giving another fucking penny to them. I’m sure that they’re leaving money on the table sending all those texts… pissing people off.
2346,I believe it has officially reached 1 billion. I donated one more time during the debate but the rest of my donations are now going to down ballot people lol.
2347,With what the campaign had from Biden + all the money raised since Kamala took over it has broken $1 billion
2348,Im no expert but I assume this has to do with tge right and SuperPACS but Im not even remotely an educated person when it comes to campaign finances.
2349,Yay! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
2350,Mine was 2004 which was just sort of sad. hopefully you get to experience your first being part of something historic!
2351,"Great. Are you registered? You need to be registered (you can’t just show up). Do have any ID you might need?

You may know all that, but in case someone lurking is in the same situation and reading this I wanted to raise awareness."
2352,"Exactly. I'm a man and while my opinion should be considered it shouldn't carry the same weight as a woman's on this issue. Anecdotally, it seems to be the men who are the loudest about being anti-abortion. Which is fucking WEIRD."
2353,"This 100% - I also think if we can give Harris a blue congress we will be pleasantly surprised with what we get ;) 

But only if she gets a blue congress!"
2354,"They already sent 10 million to down ballot races and I’m sure more is to come, after all we NEED a blue congress to gsd"
2355,"Even if every current swing state is completely saturated you could in theory bring resources to those that are non traditionally not as close but now getting closer and force Trump to divert some resources defending it. Plus game matters as well and hers is much stronger, but more resources help."
2356,Also would go a long way to shorten the election season. I think they spent like $10 million TOTAL on the ENTIRE recent UK election. Most countries don't spend this much time on elections
2357,"They accrue more donations by reaching out than saying nothing at all, I assure you."
2358,Mine was 2016 which was very sad...
2359,I am registered. I’m in WA so my ballot is going to come in the mail and I’ll be able to drop it off at my leisure
2360,"> Anecdotally, it seems to be the men who are the loudest about being anti-abortion.

Because how dare a woman be able to make a choice by herself about something that affects both of them! (even when it clearly affects her much more) 

The men who are loudest about this are, anecdotally, men who women wouldn't want children with in the first place."
2361,Well I choose apathy. I’ll vote but the daily inconvenience FOREVER staring at my phone notifications has turned me off to donations for good.
2362,Mine was 2000 which was sad in a different way.
2363,"Especially the men who are loud about it because they claim they want to ""protect the innocent unborn"" or whatever the fuck."
2364,"Men are too emotional for politics let alone making reproductive decisions, its why they're men."
2365,"That’s pretty much what it boils down to. Either A, they were forced because of religious values to have a family or b, they’ve never got any."

2367,"She would be th e first woman to win everything, in case anyone is watching."
2368,I can think of a way she would have won Pennsylvania
2369,If she wins I will no doubt be crying on election night. Having representation at the highest office is something women have never had.
2370,Hillary won a few states in 2016. But not PA.
2371,There is no evidence to support that theory.
2372,I will be very very happy to have been alive when it happens.
2373,"Reddit keeps giving me a 500 error so I'm trying this for the last time:

Lets look at the last few elections and compare the changes in the VPs home states from the prior election (ex. California's results in 2016 when the VP wasn't from there vs. California 2020 when the VP was. I've rounded to the nearest whole number

2016 California: 62% Democrat

2020 California (Harris): 63% Democrat

2012 Indiana: 54% Republican

2016 Indiana (Pence): 56% Republican

2012 Virginia: 51% Democrat

2016 Virginia (Kaine): ok this one is sort of weird bc there was a bigger 3rd party vote this time. Hillary won w/ 49% of the votes and a bigger margin of victory than Obama did in 2012. How much a vice president affects 3rd party voting is a different question.


2008 Wisconsin: 42% Republican

2012 Wisconsin (Ryan): 46% Republican


2004 Delaware: 55% Democrat

2008 Delaware: 62% Democrat

2004 Alaska: 61% Republican

2008 Alaska (Palin): 59% Republican

**I'M CALLING 2008 ALASKA MY EXCEPTION THAT PROVES THE RULE BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BOTH GOT LESS PERCENTAGE OF THE VOTES THAN THEY DID PREVIOUS ELECTION (LIKE 2016 VIRGINIA), AND THEY LOST BY A BIGGER MARGIN THAN THEY DID BEFORE (UNLIKE 2016 VIRGINIA). I EXPLAIN THIS AWAY BY SAYING SARAH PALIN IS AN IDIOT**

anyways back to comparing.

2000 North Carolina: 43% Democrat

2004 North Carolina (Edwards): 44% Democrat

Before these years, Ross Perot...existed and I don't think its fair to include that data. 

All that said, there is a boost given to the states the VP comes from in the last 20 years, and anyone saying absolutely ""there's no evidence"" is being dishonest."

2375,what?

2412,">The Department of the Interior today announced the availability of up to $43.5 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for small water storage projects that will create new sources of water for communities in the West. Surface water and groundwater storage are essential tools in stretching the limited water supplies worsened by a changing climate. These projects will increase water management flexibility, making water supply more reliable and communities more resilient. 

>President Biden’s Investing in America agenda represents the largest investment in climate resilience in the nation’s history and is providing much-needed resources to enhance Western communities’ resilience to drought and climate change. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Reclamation is investing a total of $8.3 billion over five years for water infrastructure projects, including rural water, water storage, conservation and conveyance, nature-based solutions, dam safety, water purification and reuse, and desalination. Since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was signed in November 2021, Reclamation has announced more than $4.2 billion for an ever-growing list of 586 projects.  
...  
The Small Storage Program, authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, funds projects with a water storage capacity between 200 acre-feet and 30,000 acre-feet. The funding opportunity announcement can be found on www.grants.gov by searching for opportunity number R25AS00392. This funding opportunity builds upon $35 million announced through the program for projects earlier this year.  
...

Statement from Secretary Deb Haaland:

>“Water is essential to everything we do: feeding families, growing crops, powering agricultural businesses, sustaining wildlife, and safeguarding Tribal subsistence practices,” said Secretary Deb Haaland. “Through President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, we are working to equip local communities with the infrastructure and resources they need to meet water supply demands and build climate resilience for the future.”

2416,"I think Harris has a much higher chance of winning Pennsylvania than  many think. In 2016 trump beat Clinton by 44,000 votes, in 2020 Biden beat Trump by almost double what Trump beat Clinton by. I find it hard to believe Trump would be able to flip that many votes while running the same old playbook that drew people out to vote against him last time."
2417,Harris is gonna win PA and win the election! As long as we all VOTE!
2418,"I'm from South Central PA and drove home over Labor day. Compared to 2020, there were damn few Trump yard signs. And I mean damn few. There were still some nuts with big Trump displays along the PA turnpike but those have been there since 2020 or before. 

I didn't see any Harris signs but her signs weren't really available then due to the printing needing to wait until after she picked a VP. Her site said they they ship on 9/5. Starting last weekend, maybe 30% of the houses in my very blue neighborhood now have Harris signs with 2 or 3 Trump signs."
2419,">Roan said the county party is also focused on down-ballot races like Democrat Janelle Stelson’s effort to unseat U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, and a state House race in which Democrat Sara Agerton is challenging Republican State Rep. Sheryl Delozier.

Both of these races would be highly consequential if Dems can win them. A Stelson victory would help us flip the US House and an Agerton victory would help us maintain our majority in the Penn state House, which at the moment is a single-seat majority (102-101).

2420,"“I just can’t not support him because he’s my only choice on the side that has done well by me,” [Schin] said.

He’s referring to the cost of goods and gas. Fuck women’s rights, minorities, LGBTQ protections, NATO, and our national security. As long as Trump lowers the price of bread and milk, this guy is A-OK with the destruction that Trump brings to everyone else. 

“Christine Rigling, 54, of neighboring New Cumberland, is also a former Trump voter. Rigling, who is married to the Lower Allen fire chief, said she and her husband both voted for Trump in 2016 even though they didn’t necessarily like him. They are now both Democrats and voted for Biden in 2020.”

Love this though. Let’s keep it going."
2421,I'm currently volunteering in PA and we NEED MORE VOLUNTEERS. I was timid at first but over half of volunteers are doing it for the first time! Everyone has been so friendly and motivating. Don't be afraid! The campaign will train you on how to confidently interact with voters and help Kamala win!
2422,"She showed the world how easy it is to bait that man, that's the last thing I would want to happen when he's dealing with other world leaders. He'll get spun like a fucking top by other dictators."
2423,How is it not 90-10 in favor of Harris at this point??
2424,"That Polish comment is going to be a game changer, isn't it?"
2425,"If this is true and it holds, it’s over for Trump. End of story. 

Our challenge at this point is keeping enthusiasm high and getting people to turn out. 

We do that, and Harris is our next pres. "
2426,Taylor is from Penn. Thanks Taylor!
2427,"Centre County will also be another part of Central PA that plays a crucial role, since that includes State College/PSU. Dems have won the county every presidential election going back to 2008 and I sure don’t see it flipping back this time around."
2428,Don’t count GA out either. We’re in this together 🤝
2429,"this is significant! Pennsyltucky is traditionally red and what makes PA purple. It's teh reason PA went red in 2016 and 2000.

In every election of the past 30 years, if Pennsyltucky goes blue, the dem wins.

BUT YOU STTILL HAVE TO VOTE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN"
2430,"I can attest to this. I went to visit my parents in Mechanicsburg. A suburb outside of Harrisburg.

  


There are literally no Trump signs on our street. Last election it was almost every other house. Whether that means they're not voting for Trump, I have no idea but it's a good sign."
2431,"This is more of a Milwaukee, WI suburbs post and I wish I saved the map. But a user did a comparison of the past three elections (2012, 2016, 2020) and it was noticeable that the blue is starting to spread out into the suburbs more. I have been living in my village for my 2nd Trump election and I can tell there are less Trump signs around."
2432,I live in Central PA.  When you look at the precinct by precinct voting from 2020 you would see some pretty surprising things.   The old line republican areas were either slightly blue or slightly red.  20 years ago it would have been solid red.
2433,"2 more months for Harris to run on an actual agenda while Trump continues to bitch about immigration. One thing I know about Pennsylvanianians, the southern border is their TOP priority.  PA will be solid blue by November."
2434,PA is huge. And has been very close up to now.
2435,I’m not surprised- the republicans did absolutely nothing for the citizens- all they did was carry trump nut sack of grievances for the last 8 years- and they wonder why they are losing? Name one thing they done for America…
2436,Central PA? Suburbs?
2437,Pennsyltuckey becoming Pennsylfornia?
2438,"If you have young friends or relatives in Pennsylvania, you can help us win. Call or text or email them. Ask them if they are voting. Ask them if they have a plan to vote. Just don’t mention Harris or Trump; according to my son, that’s a turnoff. And if you’re older like me, young people resent being told whom to choose. (70% will vote D anyway)."
2439,Yep. I'm not worried about PA. The demographics everywhere favor the Dems.
2440,"I'm from PA. If we can go off the number of Trump signs, and the number of Harris signs, she has this state already. There are houses that have had trump signs up year round since 2016. Those signs disappeared. I never saw a Clinton sign, or a Biden sign, but Harris signs are popping up everywhere. I live in the suburbs, but my in-laws live in the rural areas and I travel for work and it's been a dramatic shift as of late. I hope that's a solid indicator, but we always have to account for Pensyltucky"
2441,2016 was the one election to go to republican since clinton first won in '92. and it was moreso a drop in democrats voting than more % votes for republicans. republican candidates typically hover between 46-48%. 2016 was the first and only time since 2000 that a democrat did not get at least 50% of the vote.
2442,"They wouldn't be flipping, they be unengaged citizens not bothering to vote.


This is a consistent problem, voter engagement is about half the eligible population."
2443,"He doesn't need to flip many voters. As long as a big drop in turnout occurs among demographics favouring Harris, he can win. 2020 had record turnout due to Covid 19, BLM and one of the biggest economic crashes in a lifetime. I expect a drop in turnout and the winner will be whos least affected IMO."
2444,"I agree with you. However, I think the worry isn’t votes flipping but just votes not happening"
2445," It does seem like there's a shift happening. The lack of Trump signs might point to lower enthusiasm, which could definitely play a role in the election. It's interesting to see how people's political engagement changes over time—guess we'll just have to see how everyone rallies for turnout."
2446,"As a Pennsylvanian, I concur.  Senator Bob Casey will also win!"
2447,"YES, THIS. 
These reports and polling don't win elections, voting does (those kind of polls do!)
VOTE! we can finally move past having to hear the name of a convict every day of our lives."
2448,I’ll be in line up in the Northern Tier!
2449,"Honestly, who wants to put a target in your yard or on your car to invite retaliation from the Trump nut jobs out there?"
2450,"You make a good point about the availability of Harris-Walz signs. I’ve been waiting almost 3 weeks for my sign to arrive. Like new voter registrations, small dollar contributors, endorsements by flocks of well-known people, the visible shift in sign enthusiasm is yet another indicator of Harris likely success."
2451,"I’m seeing way less Trump signs in Lancaster County this year. And when I do see them there’s like 4-5 in the same yard which doesn’t mean much. A lot of Harris signs are going up each day too, I’ve seen a few even outside of the city area"
2452,"I will love it if York goes blue, but that has nearly no chance of happening"
2453,It’s more toned down but there’s still a bunch out trump merch out there. I’ve seen a bunch of Janelle Stelson signs which is what really matters.
2454,"the PA turnpike is not your average votors, that's like, the farms and factories. you have to get off and go into the housing developments to see the large numbers of average pennsylvanians."
2455,"I watched Stelson for years on local news before I moved away. She wasn't just another pretty face. She was no nonsense, very informed and community-minded. I was happy to hear she was running for office."
2456,"Since Labor Day I am seeing Stelson ads frequently on local over the air stations which cover a general audience. I am not seeing any ads for Perry on local stations. He may be spending money on targeted channels I never watch.
The Dems appear to be trying to flip the seat."
2457,I've got a feeling that if Scott Perry gets bounced out of congress that he would soon be served with an indictment from Jack Smith. Here's hoping!
2458,"It’s just crazy to me because republicans are not good for the economy, and never have been! They increase the deficit, and trump explicitly wants more tariffs, which will be passed onto consumers"
2459,"Plus *there’s no evidence or guarantee that Trump will lower the price of goods.* He’s willing to vote for a convicted felon and rapist, our most corrupt and moronic presidential candidate ever, over something that MIGHT happen. All the economic models show inflation would be worse under Trump anyway. I guess his voters would call all the economists nerdy poindexters and plug their ears against them."
2460,"Hi, what can I do to help volunteer? I’m currently residing in Boston, but my work is extremely flexible so I could be in Pennsylvania as needed. My wife and I are planning a day to write postcards for swinging states, her for PA and me for my home state of North Carolina. Please let me know if there’s anything else I can do considering I have a decent amount of flexibility in terms of work "
2461,"First, thank you!!!! 💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸

I'm doing my part remotely from CA donating and writing postcards. But, we are grateful to all of you in swing states who put so much into this. Thank you again!!"
2462,90 to 10 what? according to who?
2463,"I thought so, and I am not even in Pennsylvania nor of Polish descent."
2464,"Apparently, her father grew up in PA too. My older sister posted something derogatory about her and learned that Daddy graduated the same high school she did."
2465,"I lived for a year in LeMoyne so this was an interesting read. The old man who buttonholes people at the gas pump to waste their time talking about ""Uncle Joe"" is the most on-brand Pennsyltucky thing I can think of. Also, his comment about white horses running with palominos has got to be some kind of insane Pennsyltucky racist comment I haven't heard yet. This does sound like good news though!"
2466,Are there still confederate flags all over the place? I lived in LeMoyne between 2013-14 driving delivery for a sheet metal company. Coming from the PNW it was shocking!
2467,"no, pennsyltuckey. very rural. some housing developments and a lot of farmland. it's west virginia north."
2468,"""They call it the T, there's Pittsburgh and Philly, the KKK fills out the rest!""


This is something an old guy from NY told me on my first day at work when I moved to Harrisburg for a year. "
2469,"Polling only has her up by 0.2% in PA though, so getting people to the polls needs to be everyone's #1 effort."
2470,"Well, I am worried about PA.


It's super close, and looking for reasons to feel like the outcome is secured is premature because it isn't.


Let's relax once he loses."
2471,"I'm still seeing a shit ton of Trump signs here in PA, and only a modest amount of Harris ones."
2472,2004 also
2473,"At the same time, are we seeing much evidence this will happen? Dem enthusiasm is highest since ‘08, and we’re seeing good reporting on fundraising, volunteers, new registrations, etc."
2474,There is no indicator there will be any drop in turnout. If anything I can see more turnout with how unprecedented this election is which bodes well for democrats. Just look at the midterms and how roe drove out people to vote nullifying the “red wave”
2475,"Do you have a source for that drop in entusiasm or just speculation? 

I'm just curious becasue everything I've seen is an indication that people are more motivated to vote than ever. If there are hard facts to the contrary I'd like to know."
2476,"Disagree, republican violence is personal to a lot of people. I believe voters are just as motivated to turn out this time as we were in 2022, 20 and 18."
2477,You don't think a Black woman candidate is energizing to Black woman voters in places like Philadelphia?
2478,I don’t see a drop in Harris’ Demographics though.
2479,"Every election since dobbs dems have overperformed, and this is the biggest one since then and you think people will sit it out? Even with abortion directly on ballets in more than a few red states? No chance. Might still be close but won’t be because of low turnout."
2480,This is it. Motivated to vote in 2020 does not equal motivated to vote in 2024.
2481,"Plus one, Senator Casey is going to humiliate another vulture capitalist, carpetbagging wannabe. And we already saw what Harris did to the gop's cult head. That was only the trailer to the main event of Trump's complete humiliation; another election loss, by a woman, a woman of color! It will be a fantastic night and the ultimate cathartic experience for all sentient beings."
2482,"Depends where you live. If I lived in a rural area, I'd be less excited about it. No way in hell would I ever put something on my car."
2483,It’s probably dumb but I’m doing it in my very red city. I want to make a statement that it’s ok to show your support for Kamala here.
2484,You're correct about this. All of my neighbors that I know are Democrats do not put yard signs out. I feel like it's only common in areas that are solidly blue.
2485,"I didn't want to wait and bought a sign on Etsy that arrived just after Labor Day. They have a lot of really nice unique signs. Just search for ""kamala harris yard sign"".

I normally don't do yard signs but we heard so much in the previous two elections about ""how could Trump possibly lose with so much obvious support"", due in part to the sea of Trump yard signs everywhere. I felt it was important to let MAGA voters see the enthusiasm and support for Harris. Though I live in a very blue neighborhood, so a Harris yard sign is hardly a bold move."
2486,"I walked into my local Dem HQ and they were out of signs for Harris and Slotkin. Said they were buying them themselves in 1,000 sign bunches and couldn’t keep them in stock. I’m in a battleground county in a battleground state."
2487,"Got a text telling me mine was going to be late.


Which, I encourage everyone voting for Harris to get a sign! Election denials are going to happen. Make it abundantly clear that Harris voters are out there."
2488,Same. I am pretty sure someone down the street removed his flag. There are some things if you head through Manheim toward Mt. Hope where someone bought some big sign and a shitty pickup to cover in stickers and a cutout.
2489,"The turnpike thing was just an aside. When I mentioned a lack of Trump signs, was referring to driving through various neighborhoods across South Central PA."
2490,"Republicans are masters at convincing the uninformed they are kings on the economy. It’s the same song and dance every time: Republicans get elected, wreck the economy, democrats get elected, fix it, republicans get re-elected, then proceed to take credit for democrats economic successes. 

Trump rode high on Obama’s economy and then left us with crazy inflation (a global problem, but republicans didn’t handle it here very well), and we were in the beginning stages of a manufacturing recession. 

Doesn’t help when the New York Times interprets his quote about tariffs bringing in so much money for us that it’ll pay for childcare costs as a “disputable policy assumption” knowing full well he’s damn wrong that tariffs won’t be anything but, as you just said, an extra cost for us."
2491,"Feels over reals with these guys. They *feel* Trump will lower their grocery bill, therefore it’s a fact. I was reading an article last night about an undecided voter in Georgia who said he’s leaning Harris, but he’s worried about the market going down during her presidency and that is giving him pause. These are not serious people."
2492,Check out Vote Save America! They’re a fantastic GOTV organizing group. https://votesaveamerica.com
2493,"90% Harris - 10% Trump

If you have any consciousness and care about the country, you would not vote for him due to:

- 34 guilty felony charges

- 58 pending felony charges

- he’s a rapist

- he led an insurrection

- he stole top secret documents and probably sold them 

- he’s also been credibly accused of child rape

- additionally he’s hell bent on dividing the country, and has suspicions ties to Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Hungary, among others 

It’s an absolute disgrace that he’s the Republican Party’s nominee."
2494,"Maybe further out in the boonies but I haven't seen a Confederate flag in Mechanicsburg, Camp Hill, Enola, or Lemoyne in ages"
2495,"Look I'm not gonna say pa is a lock for Harris. But I live in a very red county.


I am seeing significantly less trump signs and flags than I remember. Unless something changes here I feel like enthusiasm for trump is gonna be a lot lower than in 16 and 20"
2496,"My theory is that the reality is not as close as the polls suggest. 

Who would pay attention to the polls if Harris were up by several points in every swing state? Who would watch the news?"
2497,"I don’t know that much about polling, but I don’t think the polling methodology has kept up with technology. Either they’re not reaching a representative sample of the population, or the assumptions they’re making to “adjust” the data have to be wildly off base. There is no way Trump is doing nearly as well as the polls show."
2498,"Polls are close, not the election, because the election isn't until November when we vote"
2499,People are allowed to be enthusiastic.
2500,"Don't relax when he loses. 

That's when the real shitshow begins."
2501,"If we're going just by 2020 metrics, Trump would need to pick up more than 88,000 votes than last time. And this was Trump 4 years younger, no Jan. 6th, and no felonies. Now we have the opposite end with Kamala, who is generating vastly more enthusiasm than Biden, raising a mammoth amount of capital, post-Dobbs boost, and has big ground games in every swing state. And now Trump has an absolute braindead disaster of a performance. By no means secured, but the metrics are heading the right way."
2502,"Please don't say that, it could discourage people."
2503,....no? PA was still Kerry easily
2504,"And PA has mail-in ballots, which encourages turnout, which favors Harris."
2505,"A educated guess. Possible I'm wrong, but 2020 had the perfect storm of conditions to cause a high turnout election IMO, it was the highest turnout in a election in over 100 years, seems unlikely for that record to be broken again this year."
2506,"2022 midterm had lower turnout then 2018. very high for a midterm but still lower, I'm telling you having Trump IN the white house was a incredible motivator for voting. And the Trump voting base does not seem nearly as euthanistic as they were in the past. Guess we will see whos right in 5 weeks."
2507,"And you think LESS people are motivated to vote, despite all evidence to the contrary?"
2508,"I would fucking drag myself over rusty nails and broken glass to vote against the GOP, but, thankfully, I don't need to because PA has mail-in voting. (This is a reminder to check your registration, register to vote if you haven't, and you still have a few weeks to request a mail-in ballot in PA, which you can do [right here](https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/vote/voter-support/mail-in-and-absentee-ballot.html).)"
2509,"I live in MA, there's not many bluer states, and still I would be worried.  Prior to Trump, I wouldn't have been that cautious about it, but something about the guy is like fucking catnip to these people. The cultish following isn't that much less fervent here, just in smaller numbers."
2510,I bought mine from the Harris website so that the funds would go directly to that campaign. My guess is that they were overwhelmed with purchases and that caused the delay. I hope to have it tomorrow and will proudly plant it.
2511,"> Republicans are masters at convincing the uninformed they are kings on the economy.

Yes, it's part of their brand and it's not true at all. In Bill Clinton's convention speech he noted that since 1980 there were 51 MM jobs created in the US economy, and 50 MM of those came under Democratic presidents. And job growth has been better under dems going back to Truman. Maybe republicans are better at giving tax breaks to businesses, but that doesn't help the middle class."
2512,you're getting excited over nothing. his numbers are made up. he has no sources.
2513,"Same in NC. The presidential election margin is razor thin, yet Stein (D) is nearly +10 over Robinson. I’m also seeing a fraction of Trump merch - honestly hardly any at all.
Edit to add: I’m out in the sticks of NC. Very red"
2514,"Central PA native here. I also see less signs. I do also see and hear plenty of talk. People just don’t want to buy more signs and flags, but when it comes down to it, they will still vote for trump. I think (Hope) the state will still go to Harris, but the people that I know that vote R have not changed their minds. You don’t see Eagles fans switching to Steelers fans around here either, but I guess it could happen. For most of them it’s beyond logic, it’s basically a sports mentality and Harris plays for the wrong team."
2515,I'm about to drive through most of Wisconsin next week and I'm very curious how many Trump signs I'll end up seeing.
2516,"I just think a lot people are over the fanfare. This is different than the first election, when he was a novlety. Now it’s old and tired, but doesn’t mean they aren’t going to still vote for him."
2517,My in-laws live in lancaster. We used some houses that have had signs up since 2016 as landmarks when headed to visit. A lot of them have disappeared.
2518,"Same. Halloween 2020 there were a ton of Trump signs all over the neighborhoods. Almost all of them disappeared after J6 and very few are back up. It’s a safely red district for the house race, but getting bluer due to the shit show that became of the school board after Moms for Liberty took over and forced out the very popular superintendent."
2519,Correct. Every other tangible metric wildly favors Harris
2520,"Agreed!

I think people forget when they're spamming ""Get out and vote!"" in this sub that they're talking to the some of the most engaged people in the electorate.

Many of us are here most days keeping up with the news and we already know who we're voting for.

Polls going up or down isnt going to stop many of us from voting. 

But still polls going up for Harris is nice to see."
2521,"People should be enthusiastic about what they need to do to win.

They should not be enthusiastic about what they don't need to do."
2522,"Young people are loud and then don't vote.

Old people are quiet and do. Biden was selected specifically because he was well known in Pennsylvania.

He was a mid-atlantic pick the way Walz is a mid-west pick.

Again, get excited about what you still need to do to win. Don't get excited about what you don't need to do to win anymore.

And I don't mean money. Volunteer."
2523,Somehow I missed that we were only talking about PA not whole country.
2524,"You're also forgetting that the 2020 election took place with so many COVID related regulations, which undoubtedly had an effect on turnout. For example, with universities in PA still being virtual etc, so people voted from where they lived or not at all.


Other than the 2016 anomaly, PA has not voted for a republican for President since before 1992. PA has a Dem governor and two Dem Senators. There's no way Harris is losing PA."
2525,"I don't think there will be a repeat of the voter turnout in 2020. What motivates people to vote is different for each person. Person 1 might be very motivated to vote for reproductive rights. Person 2 might be very motivated to vote solely on inflation. It won't matter to them that the road to inflation started way before the Democrats were in the WH, all that will matter to them is that the Democrats were there when it happened. They are unable or unwilling to look and see that every country struggled with similar inflation. ""Joe was there and it was bad"". That's the extent of their thinking.

So, you have a battle of what motivates people to vote.

I think Harris can win this, it's going to be a battle though.  It could be a Florida 2000 situation."
2526,"PA has mail in voting? I didn’t realize that, that’s fucking MASSIVE. Trump supporters fucking hate it and it won’t drive up their turnout much but I think it’s a massive boon to Democrat turnout."
2527,it's the open racism and calls for violence
2528,Hunh?
2529,"I see none in wake Forest, NC.

Lot of people moved here over past 4 years from northeast. I think NC will go Blue."
2530,"> Same in NC.

Same in north Georgia. Years ago, it was Trump Central.

Last time I looked, the only big political billboard along the highway up to the Cherokee area read: Tired of all the Chaos? VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS

This used to be a place where Trump flags were everywhere, many of them hand-painted on the sided of abandoned cargo containers and homemade billboards made out of spare lumber. Because the people were that dedicated and that poor."
2531,"I don't want to spread the idea too much because don't get complacent, but I think we are seeing an opposite of 2016, where its actually Trump that is artificially doing better in the polls."
2532,"I 100% agree trumpers aren't gonna vote harris. But it's very possible a significant minority just don't vote at all


Especially if Trump continues to implode. I live in a very red county in PA myself. Most conservatives I know aren't exactly talking about the debate or politics and haven't been for a while.


Time will tell what happens but yea what happened to Clinton in 16 can easily happen to trump now"
2533,".. time to pull out the only PA joke i know as a non-american:

..so you got lost, and ended up in Intercourse, between Blue Ball and Paradise?"
2534,"Yep. Plus, Republicans died at higher rates than Democrats due to the anti-vaccination propaganda."
2535,"Yes for some people it would have affected their ability to vote but even despite that 2020 had 66% turnout, to find a presidential election with a higher turnout you need to go back to 1900 And Pennsylvania's turnout was the highest since 1992. This election doesn't feel nearly as exciting as 2020."
2536,">So, you have a battle of what motivates people to vote.

Roe vs Wade. It's really that simple."
2537,"Yep, we've had it since 2020 (technically 2019?). It's opt-in, which is why it's not more commonly known. It's why PA's results in 2020 kept trickling in slowly over several days after that election (the state counts in-person ballots first and only THEN starts counting the mail-in ballots, for whatever fucking reason).

Still, mail-in is likely why Philly gave the state to Biden in 2020. So more awareness = more better."
2538,"Exactly. I truly just do not understand how / why people are so genuinely freaked out about PA, especially when we're the party that's supposed to put facts before feelings."
2539,"If you think this election is less exciting than 2020 then you just aren’t paying attention. People weren’t even excited to go vote for Biden, they were relieved to vote Trump out. Harris has genuine grassroots enthusiasm right now."
2540,"For me and you, yes. For others? No. Though I am not an American, but I think us Canadians will be having this battle soon."
2541,"As someone that lives in PA, a lot of folks have a hard time looking past their grocery bill.

I'm not trying to be a wet blanket, just saying that there is a quiet undercurrent of displeasure with the current administration even if there's less overt enthusiasm for the previous administration."
2542,"This. Looking at the data and trends from the last 100 years of elections and the amount of enthusiasm and money from this campaign, I just don't see anything suggesting she's losing PA."
2543,"With all due respect, you're just flat wrong. Shortly after the Supreme Court repealed Roe V Wade there was a ballot measure in deep red Kansas to limit abortions which was defeated, and it wasn't close. Same thing has happened in other red  like states Ohio, and since then the Rs have lost just about every special election. Now, I live in the US and in PA, so don't tell me that you know more about the electorate here than I do, and I won't tell you that I know anything about Canadian politics. Deal?"
2544,"And yet, the Republicans are the ones screaming ""COMMUNISM IZ BADS!!1"" when the administration talks about controlling price gouging - everyone is concerned about this and only one party is offering and talking about solutions."
2545,"She's polling within the margin of error.  I believe she's only .6% ahead in PA according to 538s sum of polls.


Dems have a lot going for them over there, but it's not an open & shut case by any means."
2546,"Is your position that Harris will win by a significant margin because of Roe? That would be great! However, if Roe was the only issue, then Biden would not have been so far behind in the polls. Different people have different issues that are most important to them. If Roe was the be-all and end-all, then Harris would be up by 11 in Kansas. The measure was defeated in Kansas. I guess the point is some are ""fine"" with it being a state by state issue. That is certainly a bad idea though. It's gotta be the law of the entire land."
2547,"Eh, to the R voters, the R politicians are also talking about solutions. Their solutions are less taxes, more tariffs, less foreigners, more drilling, less handouts, more religion. A lot of people here want to live in a binary world of right and wrong, and many R politicians are offering a vision of that world."

2550,"This election could be over by 9:00.  Do it, NC!"
2551,"Hopefully Donald Trump getting crushed and destroyed in the debate will bring Florida within striking distance. Once that happens a tour of Florida by Kamala Harris and Time Walz with stops in Tampa, Orlando, and Fort Lauderdale which has most of the Haitian population. Take ten of millions from the $47,000,000 raised yesterday and force Donald Trump to defend Florida opening up opportunities to win the hearts and votes of conservative people in Pennsylvania who want better than the Donald Trump violence, Donald Trump tax increases for the working middle class, gun laws that kill children, and mindless hate."
2552,"Mecklenburg is not a light blue county. 60%+ of the vote has gone to Democrats in the last four elections. Biden won it in 2020 by ~200,000 votes, double Obama’s 2008 vote margin. It’s not what’s holding Dems back in NC. It’s right where it needs to be, though a higher turnout wouldn’t hurt.

It had 72% turnout of registered voters in 2020, just under the statewide margin of 75%.

But Dems have to turnout more than 75% of their voters statewide, especially when Republicans turned out 82% of their voters statewide.

Mecklenburg is not really the problem."

2555,Laura Loomis will take care of that
2556,And I'd be pretty shocked if NC voted to the left of GA
2557,How?
2558,"Unfortunately the county mention in the article, Mecklenburg, is home to a ton of right wing high earning bankers who commute to charlotte for work. If the kids can get out and vote it won’t be close but I’m not holding my breath. I’ve lived around that area before and it’s just middle managers at finance companies who think their 200,000 a year will be wrecked by Kamala’s tax plan."
2559,It could possibly go blue if the turnout against Mark Robinson for governor is strong.
2560,With the state of things in GA I would really hate to need those points to get over 270 though
2561,PA and NC get called early or the writing is on the wall via their exit polls.
2562,Yeah but I still have a hard time seeing that without GA also going blue
2563,"Harris winning NC would invalidate any numbers games we’d be playing the rest of the night because it would indicate a likely landslide. If NC goes blue by any margin, it’ll be safe to begin assuming national polls overestimated support for Trump and Harris will win just about every other battleground state."
2564,Do you think either will get called early or are we going to have to wait 3 days again ?
2565,Part of why 2020 had such a long delay was that states like Pennsylvania had laws that they couldn't start counting absentee ballots until after the polls closed. They also had a significantly higher number of absentee ballots than usual because of the pandemic.
2566,"Well so besides for no pandemic, is the law different now?  Cause a lot of ppl may still vote absentee"
2567,The law is not different. They may open the ballots but they are not allowed to start counting them until the polls open.
2568,Thank you then I’m not sure how we are going to know quickly if there is a lot of counting to do
2569,"It is really going to rely on how many people show up on election day and specifically for who. If the early vote is heavy Dem like usual and election day isn't heavy Rep, it'll be fast. I just don't see that happening. NC may be called before PA, but they also didn't finish counting until a few days later either. 

My guess? We probably won't know within the first 24 hours."
2570,"Will they stop counting at some point over night? If they all count through the night, we might have a picture by morning. I think some states will be razor close and will go to recounts."

2572,"Whenever Americans are directly polled on what they feel about issues, it invariably turns out to be that the country leans center-left.  The only reason why Republicans are able to compete on the federal level is because so many people are uninformed or misinformed or (and this is the big one) they just do not vote for whatever reason.

If Swift can get even just a few thousand people in swing states who otherwise would not voted to vote, then it really does matter."
2573,"Some stats from the video if you don't have time to watch.

400% - 500% increase in the number of people registering to vote since Swift announced

9-10 thousand registering per hour since Swift announced

80% of new registrants usually vote 

Pennsylvania new registrants 46% DEM, 21% REP"
2574,"Bigly it is clear...because JD VANCE said 

*I don’t think most Americans, whether they like her music, are fans of hers or not, are going to be influenced by a billionaire celebrity who I think is fundamentally disconnected from the interests and the problems of most Americans.*

Does it get any weirder than this when his BOSS is one of these?"
2575,"All you young people...i know my generation has helped fuck things up in this country, but please save us from this imbicle.  We need you to save us again like in 2020...please, and thank you, that is all."

2578,"Anything to help Harris build up her < 30 margin, it’s way too low vs Biden in 2020."
2579,Still waiting on VD Trance to announce his and Drumpf’s big Lazy-boy endorsement…🤣
2580,What pisses off republicans is not so much that she endorsed Kamal. It is that she is getting thousands of young adults to register for voting. Because that is what truly scares republicans; an energized and motivated young base.
2581,"I couldn't care less about Taylor Swift, and I absolutely hate the way this country worships celebrities, so these constant headlines are simply reminding me how much I hate this place. "
2582,"Given how the GOP is falling all over itself trying to cancel her (good luck with that), her impact is probably not going to be trivial."
2583,"I hate to say it.  But this election really is about Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia.  Those three states will decide the fate of all.  Anything which improves turnout in those states is good."
2584,"Good, good. I knew she would endorse him at the right time and it was the perfect timing IMO.

We just have to keep this momentum going and destroy his numbers. So much so, he won't even be able to try and scam his way through when he loses. The citizens need to speak out by voting!"
2585,Thank you! Context is very much welcome.
2586,He keeps eating his neighbors' cats. He can't be trusted.
2587,"Honestly for a gay hating republican, trump sure surrounds himself with lgbtq. JD “not gay” Vance and Laura “transitioned” Loomer and Lindsey “Child Molester” Graham"
2588,"I’ve worked on a campaign and that even with more registered dems than republicans nation wide - the GOP has the advantage of the most reliable block of voters in the United States, seniors followed closely by middle aged white males lacking a college degree."
2589,Yeah they even elected a tv show host. He sucked
2590,I care. I care a lot. It helps defeat this fucking piece of shit Trump.
2591,"None of what you said relates to the fact that someone with as many fans as her, who have already shown themselves to follow her lead, is getting people to register to vote.

You can't see past your hate to understand why that's important?"
2592,People are like that in every country... You don't hear about it because they're not world famous unlike a lot of American celebrities.
2593,And what's wild is she didn't even tell folks who to vote for. She encouraged folks to do research and choose the candidate they want. She shared (and was more than likely going to at some point) who she was voting for after those fucking idiots used an AI endorsement.
2594,I remember hearing them try during the superbowl stuff. I work as a dollar cashier so I get to hear all sorts of stupid things while I work I don’t even have to get political they do it on their own all I can do is ring them up faster
2595,">Given how the GOP is falling all over itself trying to cancel her (good luck with that), her impact is probably not going to be trivial.

Cancel Taylor Swift? Lol"
2596,"Lets not hope on North Carolina, the NCSC ratfucked their election by agreeing to a last moment pull of RFK jr"
2597,I hope she goes one step further and does an event with Kamala.
2598,He hates cats. They scratch up his favourite furniture.
2599,"You forgot about the movie actor.

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001654/"
2600,At least he doesn’t have records of drinking horse cum like the donkeys VP candidate…
2601,"On the other hand, the Harris campaign has an astonishing 26 offices open in North Carolina. At her rallies today, 2000 people volunteered to work for the campaign . third, having given 25 million to other efforts and with 47 million bank in the last day or two, Harris will fund North Carolina and advertise heavily there. Maybe all this is why she’s up three points in the most recent poll."
2602,"That would be fabulous!  I’ll bet she will but is waiting until a few weeks before Nov 5 bc “kids” have short attention spans, need last-minute reminders. "
2603,"I hate to say it because I do like her but I don’t think she would do that. I think she did the most pro-Kamala thing she’s going to do in that post. She’s ultimately not a “political” celebrity, she’s sold as an everybody celebrity and while she is a pretty unstoppable pop culture powerhouse she’s also a product that she’s selling. I don’t see one election changing that product no matter what, even though it’s such an important election.

Not to rip on her, I didn’t expect such a great endorsement from her to begin with so I’m nothing but happy."
2604,"You have fully bought into the bullshit, lol -- pitiful."
2605,Bullshit of what? Medical records? Hey just because you want to lick the boots of the Democratic Party doesn’t mean he’s not a cum guzzler.
2606,"Only had an account for a couple of months? Yeah, this isn't an election sway account..."
2607,Ignore the trolls. They are getting saltier as they see this one slowly slipping away.

2618,The solution isn't fracking
2619,"Let's say you thought climate change was a liberal hoax. 

Have we not still seen some crazy natural disasters in this country that required millions or billions of dollars to clean up?

Even if you don't believe in climate change being human driven, we are still going to have to deal with the material reality of devastating hurricanes, wildfires, flooding, etc. 

At the very least, it is better to be prepared and adequately funded to deal with the aftermath of catastrophic natural events. Even if you think it's just part of the natural ebb and flow of climate/weather."
2620,"You can rightfully add a Capitalistic framing for this issue also. 

Like him or hate him, Elon Musk revitalized the EV sector with AMERICAN made cars. 

We can do the same things with green technology and research; battery tech, solar panel efficiency, better windmills, geothermal, etc. We can research, design, produce, and sell these products worldwide to help solve a global problem. 

That's what real patriotism looks like; taking the lead and helping to solve a problem.

We did the same thing with the Covid vaccine and project Warp Speed. It was a big win with how fast the vaccine was produced, how America took the lead in organizing international groups for an international response to a global issue, and probably saved millions of lives. America should have taken a ton of pride in that effort.... but of course the entire thing is marred by the US's initial response to the pandemic, the right (and Trump) pushing hoax ""cures,"" and the left, for some reason, not being proud enough to acknowledge this amazing development as both a response to Covid and a new way to develop vaccines writ large.

That is huge. And Americans should be proud.

It made me really happy to see so many USA signs and patriotic symbolism at the DNC. We need to take that kind of imagery back from the right; I shouldn't have a feeling that when I see an American flag, I think that person is a conservative...

As a veteran and a liberal, I want my side of the aisle to start playing up the goodness of this country and what we can achieve."
2621,"Hot take, she’s not. She is bending the knee to big oil, just listen to the debate. She’s explicitly said she won’t ban fracking, she’s explicitly said she’s proud to have approved more leases for drilling, and wants to ramp up natural gas production.

I am for her, but let’s be real: She’s saying what she needs to say to get elected. Let’s not pretend she is a climate crusader, it gets us nowhere."
2622,"Call me a cynic, but people have been trying to frame climate change in different ways to help get through to people for years and years, and it hasn't seemed to matter. If framing it as something personal like ""if not doing this for yourself, do it for your grandchildren and future family lines"" doesn't seem to make the deniers budge, I'm not sure that saying it's your patriotic duty will budge them either, but give it a shot, I suppose."

We'll already be mostly living in underground homes within 30 yrs."

2634,Supporting fracking is the opposite of climate action.

But that doesn't make it any less important."

The state's culture is huge on being able to **** off into a natural place for a day to clear your mind and everywhere from the Meremac to the Ozarks, from the swimming lakes at the AK border to the fields by Iowa, it hasn't been right for the longest time.  

You can see the sand bars growing along the big muddy and it fills you with dread"
2641,I miss seeing lightning bugs.
2642," I feel you on that nostalgia, it's wild how much things have changed in just a few decades. It’s like the weather has gone from a reliable part of childhood to a mixed bag of extremes. People really need to open their eyes to the reality of climate change, especially when the proof is literally in our backyards. It's a shame that even when facts are presented, some still cling to denial out of fear or maybe just a stubborn need to be right."
2643,"That and it's what gives the gulf states, Saudi Arabia, and Russia so much power, it's literally in our best national interest to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels completely aside from climate change."
2644,"> What's more patriotic than harnessing the sun that shines and the wind that blows across our amber waves of grain?

Damn that’s good. I’m gonna have to start talking like this."
2645,Freedom to have a livable future and less reliant on foreign energy sources seems like a win
2646,"Fun fact: the USAF was actively investigating weather control as a means of national security, before being killed off under GWB (to be fair, they hadn't yet had any significant successes).

Their rationale was that the climate was going to continue changing, and they wanted to be ahead of the game to ensure American farmers would be able to produce sufficient yields (secondary intended ""benefit"": denying rain to opposing nations, which raises a whole shit-ton of problematic questions).

The military has long considered climate change to be a critical factor in upcoming conflicts over water & arable land, as well as other valuable resources."
2647,"I would rather Harris gets elected and keep policies of climate action and not ban fracking, than trump gets elected and remove policies of climate action and encourage fracking. 

The reason why there are more us oil production and fracking is because OPEC price control and the Russian invasion resulting sanctions lead to higher prices so it is profitable for US relatively high cost of production. 

As clean energy and electric alternatives become more affordable, it will lead to lower prices for oils and unprofitably of fracking and lower output in the us and around the world. It will be like how coal's production goes down."
2648,You don’t think we should pump millions of gallons of unknown proprietary chemicals into the ground for a single fracking well?
2649,"I mean yeah, she needs to say what she has to to get elected. Being full green isn't a winning position, unfortunately. But the thing is, once you're in office you pivot to the left (or she can at least be pressured to). Biden had some fairly traditional or conservative takes, and then once in office he was more to the left than expected. 

I believe she personally wants more sustainable and cleaner energy, she just knows she can't fully run on that. I also believe once in office she would continue to use fossil fuels and the like, but I wouldn't be surprised if her administration pushed more for alternatives or gave more incentives to find alternatives.

It sucks, but I don't think she's ignorant on this topic, she just knows you have to get in office first. Once there you give the people the stuff they didn't know they wanted.

Of course maybe I'm just being overly optimistic, but I think she's going to be to the left of Biden on many things in practice, and I was already pleasantly surprised by him."
2650,"Option #1 - bend on fracking to help keep PA competitive knowing if she loses NC, PA  and GA she likely will lose to Trump.

Option #2 -  be unflexible,  lose PA, lose the election to the GOP who will be far more damaging to the environment and will let far more fracking happen than Democrat who can use power of compromise to keep it in check.

What are you picking?"
2651,"When told our actions are leading to an extinction level event, our collective response has essentially been ""fixing or changing would be too expensive"" and we just keep on keeping on. 

Cynicism isn't even close to the appropriate emotion to feel lol"
2652,"Supporting fracking is pretty essential for winning PA and the overall election. It’s a sad truth, but I’d rather have her support fracking while investing billions in clean energy infrastructure and habitat restoration. You have to be realistic"
2653,Oh you should definitely expand on what you're saying here.
2654,Like Texas?
2655,Bots should be banned.  No human posts this much at exactly 2 minute intervals.
2656,"""Conservatives"" are so fucking stupid to fall for green energy being a liberal agenda. ffs we could be leading the world in renewable energy, completely self reliant (or mostly)"
2657,It should be framed as a national security issue
2658,"Agree. It’s a pretty savvy strategy I think- she knows she doesn’t have to do anything in particular to demonstrate that she’s to the left of trump on climate, so she’s using the issue to win over moderates and maybe some conservatives with pro-fossil fuel talking points.

I just really need her to make that pivot to actual green policy when she gets in. If she gets in."
2659,Until lobbyists find a way to legally redefine fracking as clean energy thus allowing the mines access to those invested millions
2660,"It's also crazy because conservative states have the most potential for renewable energy.  The renewable energy comes across from wind whipping across the plains, and hydro from rivers running down mountains, and sunlight which is way more prevalent in the sun belt and the south.

They act like people are out to get them with natural gas being phased out in New builds.  I live in a home with no natural gas, and I have solar panels.  It's pretty sweet never having an energy bill because I produce more than I use. I don't get why people are against things like that."
2661,Much easier to lobby that under the guy who wants to abolish the EPA rather than under Harris
2662,lol that will never happen. That is just doomer view.
2663,He could absolutely neuter it to the point of uselessness

2665,"Vance: “I don’t think most Americans… are gonna be influenced by a billionaire celebrity who I think is fundamentally disconnected from the interests and the problems of most Americans”

My dude, who do you think your running mate is?"
2666,"Don't be sad, MAGA!

You still got kid rock and ted nugent!"
2667,"Elon offered to impregnate her shortly after the endorsement.

How low are these people willing to go?"
2668,"Megan Kelly and Ben Shapiro  are considerably angsty, spewing lies for Russian money."
2669,">They probably have a right to be concerned. As of Wednesday morning, at least 300,000 people clicked on Swift’s link to register to vote.

I hope lots of these new voters are in swing states where a 1% difference could mean we have our first woman president and Trump will be scrubbed out of politics forever!"
2670,"I never credited MAGA with an abundance of insight, but did they really not already know where Swift stands?  This is a surprise to them?  

Occasionally I wonder whether I might finally be condescending towards MAGA, and every time I quickly learn that I still give them too much credit."
2671,"Mike Johnson spewing straight up lies this morning just shows me MAGA is the scum of the earth and does not represent any American value, only palingenetic ultranationalism through any means necessary, while using Christianity as a cloak to mask their true intentions of batshit take over. They would burn the constitution if they had the chance. Loyalty to themselves and their extremism."
2672,"She’s gonna lose all her Republican fans! This is the beginning of the end. 

Just like in 2020 when she endorsed Biden. No one has heard from her and she hasn’t made one red cent since then. In fact, when was the last time anyone even heard her name?

Big /s obvs"
2673,"Elon Musk offered to “give her a baby and protect her cats with his life.”

This again shows the disgusting level of misogyny on the right. I hope they keep letting it all out. Show the world the disgusting people we all know them to be."
2674,MAGA Made America Genuinely Awful.
2675,He can't shake it off
2676,"> J.D. Vance took a more cordial tone speaking with Fox News on Wednesday—but still felt the need to weigh in on the news. “I don’t think most Americans, whether they like her music or are fans of hers or not, are gonna be influenced by a billionaire celebrity who I think is fundamentally disconnected from the interests and the problems of most Americans.”

Sorry J.D, I'm confused. Didn't Team Moldy Orange want us to be impressed that weird ass Elon Musk had endorsed Trump?"
2677,Maybe MAGA should not have taunted her with fake AI endorsement?
2678,"It was a fake endorsement, there's no endorshment, she didn't endorse--look at the pictures, okay, looook at the pictures; we had pictures of her, with us, and the crowds, because our crowds are the highest, the biggest I would say that America has ever seen, and everyone knows it, because of the fact--and the country has never seen anything like this before and it's a very big problem, very big part of the--but think of it, you have this endorsement, this phony endorse, because she doesn't endorse, they say apolitical, okay, believe me, it doesn't, it doesn't make any sense for her to endorm--is it endorse or endorm anyway, no one knows what the hell the word is, such a stupid word--but she doesn't endorse, it's a fake photo and a fake story, and we have a very strong demand and a lawsuit coming out very soon, because from the standpoint of endorsement, she doesn't endorse, believe me."
2679,Politics is definitely more emotional when pop culture gets involved.
2680,"MAGA is so dumb. She endorsed Biden last time. Of course she will endorse Harris.

Trump is awful and more senile than 4 years ago. Just listen to him talk. Have to be crazy to vote for this crazy weird guy."
2681,"This is a war, make no mistake about it. It may not be one fought with weapons but it is certainly a war of ideologies none the less. I often hear media personalities talk about how, you can hate trump, but you can't hate all his supporters. Yes you can. These people are vile human beings, every one of them, old, young, black, white, whatever. These people support an ideology that is radically unamerican in every way. If we ever want to take this country in the right direction, its going to take a lot more then just voting because even if he loses in 24, he will be back again in 28, and even if he doesnt run again, he will have another more radical follower run on his behalf, this is not over.

Don't talk to them, don't be friends with them, don't patronize businesses that support him and for the love of god, do not give them a platform to spread their russian propaganda nonsense. Trump feeds off attention, good, bad, all of it. The worse he looks, the more they love him."
2682,"MAGA is being too loud, they need to calm down."
2683,"It's funny how anytime any musician/celebrity is vocally supportive of literally any mildly ""left-leaning"" view, conservatives all bitch and moan on social media that musicians/celebrities need to stay out of politics and focus on music/acting/etc. but then they are all for wash ups like Kid Rock, Hulk Hogan, Ted Nugent, etc. being overly-vocal Trump-lickers."
2684,"I mean it’s not enough that Harris swung him around and thrashed him across the floor. But just as he was getting up from nursing his wounds, Swift came in and tackled him head first like the true Chiefs fan that she is."
2685,"She has 283 million followers on Instagram, which Trump says is still not as many people that attend an average Trump rally."
2686,"Maybe MAGA will start to realize, maybe they are the bad guys."
2687,"Right wing political talking heads are simply jealous. MAGA attracts only over-the-hill or untalented athletes like Hulk Hogan and D-list artists like Scott Baio and Kid Rock.

Popular, talented athletes and A-list artists are overwhelmingly liberal. The right wing responses, therefore, are always to attack any talented artist or athlete who shares a liberal opinion, telling them basically to “stay in their lane”.  A good example was Laura Ingraham telling LeBron James (as I recall) to “Just dribble”. 

I guarantee these dipshits would be singing her praises from the rooftops if Taylor had endorsed Trumpy."
2688,"Taylor Swift is very concerned about AI generated images so when DJT posted a AI picture of her endorsing him, what the hell did his dumb ass think was going to happen?"
2689,Cheer-up GOP. You still have Kid Rock.
2690,here’s to hoping MAGA has more reasons to be losing it come November 6 and January 20
2691,Someone save the cats! 😲
2692,"Ben Shapiro: if you're voting one way because your favorite celebrity tells you to, don't. Listen to me, a nobody, instead."
2693,"They seemed perfectly fine with the most powerful capitalist and upcoming media mogul Elon Musk, fully endorsing Trump every single day. A guy who literally owns a popular fountain of misinformation. God forbid Taylor Swift expresses her opinion because right wing AI faked her endorsement of Trump. God forbid."
2694,"Things MAGA also lose their mind at:

- Red Starbucks Cups
- Different languages
- POC
- LGBTQ
- Rainbows
- Women
- Facts
- Science
- True teachings of Christ"
2695,Funny given that they literally forced her hand by spreading bullshit AI generated shit with her likeness.
2696,"Let’s be honest. MAGA is ALWAYS straight up losing it.

Whether it’s this, or Starbucks Christmas cups, or an M&M changing shoes, or. Rainbow in target, or any number of idiotic culture war faux outrage.

They are always losing it over everything. Bunch of snowflakes"
2697,"That’s because their two biggest supporters are Hulk Hogan and Kid Rock and have an Instagram following of about 3 million people. Taylor Swift has 300 million people that follow her. She has influence, no doubt about it. More importantly, she has influence over the younger demographic and they can absolutely sway this election. Meanwhile, MAGA screams freedom of speech out of the left side of their mouth while the right side of their mouth tells Taylor Swift to keep her mouth shut. Just the same old hypocritical BS from the right."
2698,Maga straight up lost it 8+ years ago
2699,"So if Taylor swift promises to perform for free at Harris inauguration, will the swifties vote en masse? Could be a nice incentive"
2700,"I love how when it’s a billionaire who endorses VP Harris it’s “she’s out of touch with ‘real’ Americans,” but when Elon Musk comes out on Trump’s side “he’s a genius”. Zero self-awareness or logic in MAGAland."
2701,Surely between the cat lady thing and the AI generated shitter posts; they wanted her to endorse Harris. They can’t be that stupid - right?
2702,"So, it’s okay when AI Taylor Swift endorses Don-Old, but not okay when real live Taylor Swift endorses Harris. Got it. 
MAGA double standards."
2703,Someone should tell Donald trump how big Taylor swift crowds are.
2704,Seeing MAGA zombies running around like a headless chicken after Swift’s endorsement of Kamala is music to my ears.
2705,MAGA Is Straight Up Losing It ~~After Taylor Swift’s Harris Endorsement~~
2706,I dont know why or how they thought trump provoking her would end any other way
2707,I thought the Brittany Mahomes endorsement balanced things out?
2708,Megyn Kelly had a breakdown over Taylor’s endorsement too.  She was losing it over what Taylor said about supporting Tim Walz.
2709,Its crazy that they are upset since the only reason she came out and said something was because Trump POSTED AI generated images of her supporting him!
2710,There are TEN stories on fox news home page right now from a variety of fascists about how swift’s endorsement is meaningless. (Never mind that Trump tried to claim her endorsement a week or so ago.)
2711,"Scrolling through Twitter I saw a lot of posts about who shouldn't be allowed to vote, it was incredibly un-American and made me feel vile inside. We're trying to tell people who can and can't vote based on their opinions or who they are, what they do, and their characteristics of their person that they have no control over. It's a sick journey backwards through progress and history."
2712,Megyn Kelly outright telling her to go f*ck herself live was funny. What a ghoul.
2713,"The GOP and MAGA who are finally at the ""find out"" stage."
2714,I still don’t understand who made all those fake pictures of her endorsing Trump and why. Did anyone believe it?
2715,"It's funny & sad, because they pretty much have themselves to blame for it. Trump used a faked AI Swift to create the impression she supported him, which basically required her to respond.

Maybe she would've still eventually put out an endorsement, but its impact would've been muted as ""celeb endorses candidate"" instead of a rebuttal to a vile act."
2716,Taylor Swift provided her reasons for her choice of Kamala Harris and her joy from choosing Tim Walz as her VP running mate. Taylor Swift watched the debates and made an informed decision. Taylor Swift set a very good example for others.
2717,Don't worry MAGA. Kevin Sorbo will bring balance to the Farce.
2718,Looks like Taylor Swift’s endorsement is really hitting a nerve with MAGA. It's wild how much influence she has!
2719,She was staying out of it until DJT decided to broadcast his acceptance of the fake endorsement…
2720,They lost it long before this.
2721,Go Swift!!!
2722,"Celebrities have no place in American politics!!!

\*promptly votes for a man who would hate you if you said he wasn't a celebrity."
2723,">“F you, Taylor Swift!” shouted Megyn Kelly, “and f all of the people who want to see these children have body parts chopped off.”

Tell us you're against circumcision without telling us...or is chopping off parts of genitals fine, for her?

 'Cause the Rhite Whinge is definitely in favour of cutting those bits off little kids, with a few deaths and injuries just par for the course, AND the kids who are cut have zero say


""It's up to the parents"" they claIm"
2724,"I’m not sure why Vance is talking, shouldn’t a billionaire’s dick be in his mouth?"
2725,Wait until Kid Rock and Ted Nugent’s endorsements of Trump - they will completely counter Swift’s endorsement!
2726,"A conversation with my 10 year old ""Swiftie"" (in quotes because she says she is but she's really just a normal fan).


Me - ""Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris""

Her - ""What does that mean?""

Me - ""She's voting for Harris""

Her - ""OHHHH YA, Let's go, baby! We love her.""


I had a small moment of pride, haha."
2727,MAGA needs to stay away from her they are verrry lucky she didnt sue
2728,"Given what Swift sings about and her social media activity, why would they have expected anything else?"
2729,They should be losing it because he was shredded in the debate.
2730,"Let these idiots continuing off women… Hell hath no fury like a woman scorn…

Also did these scrotum lickers forget Taylor boyfriend is a nfl TE and use to full contact violence lol? Like wtf was Elon thinking with his recent post about giving her a baby."
2731,Please for fucks sake- don’t take ANYTHING for granted and VOTE the Republiturds away from any form of power.
2732,Media making them sound more lucid than they are again. Please go watch their full responses- it’s mostly incoherent rambling. Please stop making these kind of headlines
2733,"The idiots over in ""loony-land"" are trying to pretend they wouldn't absolutely cream their panties if she had endorsed Trump. 


  ""Who cares? 


  ""We all knew this was coming, she's an ultra democrat!""


   ""She's a billionaire with a plane""  


  Let me roll my eyes real quick, as if Trump didn't use AI images in order to falsify an endorsement from her.  


 It'd be hilarious if it wasn't just so unbelievably pathetic. "
2734,"“Fuck around and find out”

-Swifties"
2735,"Say what you will about T Swift, she has influence on a lot of people! I hope the blue wave is a tsunami. We need it"
2736,She’s pretty much Dethklok at this point in which her direct influence could make up 80% of the worlds economy; Except this time it’s politics
2737,"Taylor DID technically lose followers on Instagram (the only platform she made the announcement on) immediately after. I checked late that night or maybe it was the next morning and she went down about 120,000. Out of 283 million. I don't think she noticed. Or missed anyone who left.

But then she GAINED 4 times that number back by the end of yesterday and her follower count keeps growing. She passed 284 million today.

[https://instrack.app/instagram/taylorswift](https://instrack.app/instagram/taylorswift)

Better yet, they have tracked how many people visited [vote.org](http://vote.org) from the QR code in her announcement. Over 337,000 people visited from a link she put in her story (I couldn't find the link today and I was confused for a bit until I learned a story only lasts 24 hours). 

I'm curious to see if they release statistics on how many people registered after the debate, can't ALL be attributed to her but she helped in a large part.

So yeah. She REALLY regretted this MAGA. Should I be waiting for the upcoming Taylor Swift album burning parties?"
2738,OHOHOHO poor MAGA. Does it hurt knowing Taylor doesn't like your messiah?
2739,"I don’t understand why this hits them so hard. Like, wasn’t it painfully obvious even before that Swift favors Harris/Democrats in general?"
2740,"Losing  what? Their minds? Their shit? They lost all that long ago, if they ever had it."
2741,When will normal conservatives come back? I miss the days when they were just into minimizing government control and privitization.
2742,You should read what MAGA Rapey McSpace Karen threatened Taylor Swift with.
2743,But they had no problem with Hulk Hogan
2744,"Oh, MAGA world is in FREE FALL after that debacle of a debate-say what you want, Trump is a senile old man making up stories at the family BBQ! "" MAINSTREAM"" idiot media are downplaying it , because they want a close race, and they STILL fear the wrath of MAGA! Combine that, with the Swifties in tow, MAGA WORLD LOST ABOUT 20 MILLION VOTES last night. MORE THAN ENOUGH to send the GREAT ORANGE HUCKSTER ON HIS WAY!"
2745,"If they don't care, why do they have anything to say about it at all?

The stuff they try the hardest to minimize is the stuff that scares them the most.  I got a text while the debate was still going on from a guy who wanted me to look at some right wing satire from a couple of weeks ago concerning cats being snatched or something.  He said he thinks it's funny that the ""fake news"" now decides to say that particular story isn't true.  If I had to come up with a better indicator of where he thought Trump blew it out his butt on the debate stage, I don't think I could find one."
2746,"But hey, Gretchen Wilson endorsed Trump the other day. So it's a wash, right? Right?"
2747,They are mad that she has so much influence and isn't using it to their benefit. Their political platform is literally built on a foundation of selfishness.
2748,"Yeah but they have Kid Rock, why so sad /s"
2749,"They need to calm down. 

And I ain’t trying to mess with their self-expression
But I’ve learned the lesson that stressin’
And obsessin’ ‘bout somebody else is no fun…"
2750,i dont know anything about taylor swift and am not into pop music but even i can tell this is huge
2751,">“So this woman is fine with his plan to take custody of the children from parents who won’t want them to chop off their body parts and put them in Minnesota courts’ custody so the body parts can be chopped off and they can be sterilized,”

I mean this is batshit extreme, but I wonder how she feels about circumcision. 

I thought Megyn Kelly had flipped to NBC. I wasn’t aware she got sucked into the maga bullshit. She also apparently is pushing trump’s narrative that the debate was unfair for him."
2752,I love it!
2753,What I can't get my head around is this: How would have her endorsement come as a surprise to anyone?
2754,">“F you, Taylor Swift!” shouted Megyn Kelly, “and f all of the people who want to see these children have body parts chopped off

Reminder, Kelly worked at Fox for many years despite chronic sexual harassment from senior staff and executives there.  Now she wants you to vote for the serial cheater, rapist, and abuser instead of the strong female candidate, and she's spouting emotionally manipulative bullshit and lies to accomplish it.  Classic Stockholm Syndrome."
2755,Well that’s truly wonderful news.  May her light make them cower in their darkness forevermore.
2756,"Well, they do have Hulk Hogan’s endorsement… kinda cancels it out!"
2757,"I don't follow her music, but props to her for being honest about her vote with such a big platform.  In terms of celebrities being involved in politics,   she's an American, and all Americans have the right to be involved in politics.  Even kids that aren't old enough to vote can voice their opinion.

I really wanted all the focus the next day to be on the debate, but her framing helped to put more eyes on the debate, and amplify the messaging for some demographics."
2758,Megan Kelly clearly has blood coming out of her wherever.
2759,You don’t win vs swifties. Never pick that fight lol
2760,"MAGA is dead. We want our Republican party back. It was stolen by Trump and family to siphon money. MAGA are suckers donating to Trumps hijacked Republican party to pay his legal fees. America is already great, best country on the planet. Repubiicans have to make a sacrifice and vote Harris this time to take out Trump and family so they can rebuild the party. Trump does not represent our party. We are the greatest nation in history. We can keep it that way by voting Harris. Trump is about power and money, he will destroy America. Vote for America, take out the Trumps for good!"
2761,"Just watched ActualJake cover a video of the Quartering doing nothing but seething about how, ""This totally doesn't matter guys, this doesn't matter, who's even talking about this?"""
2762,You need to calm down. I really mean it magas. Go watch eras. Watch that song and listen to the lyrics. It's not too late to actually accept people.
2763,"Imagine how alone these people have to be to have everybody thought that those AI images were real.  It's too believe that Swift, who endorsed Biden and really hates Trump, would ever endorse him. 

What kind of alternate reality must they hide in."
2764,They’ve had like 4 years to prepare for this moment.
2765,"Pokes bear. Surprise pikachu face when bear reacts.
Like for the 4D chess group they seem to get surprised an awful lot by simple things such a debate prep..."
2766,Did anyone think she supported trump??
2767,Megan Kelly is all over the internet crying about.
2768,Honorary Cat Lady of the Universe
2769,"They didn’t cry over all the Republican endorsements with rape threats. They LOVE, LOVE, LOVE when “billionaires” like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and DonOLD have opinions. WTAF!!"
2770,Who's afraid of a little ol' endorsement? you should be
2771,they had it coming
2772,Wait until he hears about the size of her crowds.
2773,To be fair Trump is not a billionaire
2774,"Not to mention, the pure shitstorm he created with his miserable, childless cat lady comments. Here he is once again doubling down on his belief that unless you have children, you should not have a say in how the country is run because as childless, you obviously are not invested in the country's future. It is completely foreign to him that women can be childless (by choice or circumstance) AND still care about the next generation. He has no idea the fire he lit under women, and some men, who are childless - or know a loved one who is.

BTW, TS signed her Instagram post, ""Childless Cat Lady"". But yeah, no one is gonna relate to that. /s

Edit: My first award! Thank you!"
2775,"Vance was installed by Peter Thiel, a gay Republican tech magnate billionaire as a sort of leash/insurance policy for funding Trump's campaign. Safe to say Vance and his ~~owner~~ benefactor are at least equally disconnected from the interests and problems of most Americans."
2776,"That is so laughably ridiculous. He thinks Taylor Swift, somone in contention for most popular celebrity on the planet.... isn't going to influence people?"
2777,Why is Vance talking as if he isn’t Peter Theil’s lapdog
2778,Vance isn't very brightfor a Yale grad.
2779,"Swift gave salary bonuses to people working on her tour. Because she knows how expensive life is. If that’s not connected, I dunno what is"
2780,"Firstly, Vance isn’t qualified to determine whether someone is disconnected from the American people when he can’t even order donuts… Plus there’s his furniture issue… 

Secondly, Taylor is awesome… 

Thirdly, imagine Trump gets in his limo after losing a debate so badly that it’s going to become a legend…. Only to then see that Taylor endorsed Kamala… Nightmare fuel for him… Bliss for us…"
2781,Exactly. Vance is even more stupid than Trump.
2782,Not an actual billionaire.
2783,Sounds like Vance had a real reason to despise childless women....
2784,"*B-reel of Donald Trump and JD Vance.*

> I don’t think most Americans… are gonna be influenced by a billionaire celebrity who I think is fundamentally disconnected from the interests and the problems of most Americans

""I'm Kamala Harris and I approve this message."""

2800,He did not imply any consent on her part.
2801,"He spends all day in an echo chamber of his own creation. It's no wonder people like him are getting crazier and crazier.

I'm just waiting for Trump to say something really unhinged. A few years ago at a rally, he said homeless people should be sent to ""camps"" and that all drug dealers and users should just be executed.

 We live in hell."
2802,But Orban thought it was a great idea!!!
2803,You misspelled Leon
2804,There is no bottom. These people are engaging in fascism and are delusional. There is no level to which they will not stoop.
2805,That post was so foul and creepy
2806,"If his sperm were attached, I’d worry about very low IQ kids"
2807,I remember when Megyn Kelly tried to pretend like she'd fallen off the Trump train to get a show on NBC. Guess that didn't last...
2808,">Megan Kelly

Apparently she was upset for ABC calling out Trump's most obvious lies, and she is extremely butt hurt about it. 

""*What?!?! Why isn't he allowed to lie about babies being murdered!?  Or lie about people eating pets!*"""
2809,"She was born and raised in Pennsylvania and they really, really like her there.

https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/taylor-swift-pennsylvania/"
2810,Amazing.  Literally that could swing the election.
2811,"Once upon a time, they believed that she was their perfect Nazi Aryan princess. They jumped through mental hoops to interpret her song lyrics to align with their beliefs. Then she endorsed Biden in the 2020 election. After that, their universe collapsed in on itself and they've hated her ever since."
2812,"I think they are so deep down the rabbit hole that some of them either straight up believed the AI posts that she endorsed Donald, or that they thought that would force her hand to do so because…..reasons, I guess?  
  
It would be their tour de force, taking a precious lefty symbol from them.  Of course they are regressing to cave man levels of functional intelligence and are at the point of just trying to one up each other on imaginary accusations so the line of thinking tracks for them."
2813,">I never credited MAGA with an abundance of insight, but did they really not already know where Swift stands? This is a surprise to them? 

I think Trump had told his base (about two weeks ago) that Taylor Swift endorsed him. 

They will believe him over any outside info. Until Taylor shattered their illusion."
2814,She has a whole music video full of LGBTQ people with the lyric “shade never made anybody less gay”. You Need To Calm Down is literally a direct message to the types of people who also are likely MAGAs.
2815,"They were hoping she would stay out of politics and refuse to publicly announce which candidate she supports –  because they knew said candidate would be Harris and, further, that her endorsement would cause tens of thousands of otherwise politically apathetic and disinterested young people to vote. The swifty voting bloc could well be the difference Harris needs to carry the battleground States.


Republicans are shitting themselves over Swift's endorsement, so are doing what they do best: hurl angry, hate-fueled mysonistic abuse. "
2816,"> I never credited MAGA with an abundance of insight, but did they really not already know where Swift stands?

The older MAGA types I work with only know her as a country star, and make an awful lot of assumptions on that."
2817,She's their Aryan ideal.
2818,A lot of the believe white skin automatically votes republican. I get it all the time.
2819,"Even if they knew she leaned liberal, they expect her to keep quiet. I'm so glad she didn't."
2820,"They know, it’s just the excuse of the moment to be outraged and belligerent."
2821,"White. Blonde. Attractive. 

They think you HAVE to be MAGA if you are those things. It's why they're obsessed with Sydney Sweeney now."
2822,"Yeah, how are they losing their shit? She endorsed Biden in 2020.


Did they think she was as racist as them and Swift would suddenly not endorse Harris's because she is Black and Indian? "
2823,"Way back in 2004 when Bruce Springsteen endorsed John Kerry and joined the Vote For Change tour, I remember many of his conservative fans being SO angry.

He wasn't as overtly political prior to that, but I thought it was pretty obvious where he stood, especially after Reagan famously didn't listen to the lyrics of Born in the USA."
2824,"So glad Harris shouted out that Trump said he “quote ‘Terminate the Constitution.’” 

Real strange how he didn’t have a rebuttal for that. "
2825,"Quite right.  Excellent take.  If Trump is elected and MAGA really does put our backs to the wall... I dunno, but I have a feeling that wouldn't end well for MAGA and could spell the end of the Republican party itself."
2826,"Not only do I agree with you, Imma give you a slow clap for your use of “palingenetic.” Very nice. 👏"
2827,Well said.
2828,Does she even know if she’s alive?
2829,This is gonna hurt her in the marketplace. The marketplace where conservatives stopped buying her albums years ago to no effect.
2830,"""Go woke, go broke"" as they say. It's why Disney went bankrupt within a year of.....checks notes .... acknowledging that LGBTQ people are full human beings deserving of equal rights."
2831,"Joking aside, she can afford it. Springsteen lost about half his US audience when he came out against Trump. Swift likely WILL lose aome fans, but has more than plenty to spare."
2832,"It wasn't even an offer. He said he *will*. It was a rape threat, plain and simple."
2833,Mostly America Glorifies Assholes?
2834,My attorney got arrested
2835,They need to calm down.  They are being too loud.
2836,"Oh man, I can see an ad with images of a pouty, disgruntled, angry Trump with the song playing, sarcastically.  As in, 'don't be such a big baby.'"
2837,Hahaha! Who's disconnected from the interests and needs of most Americans??? Trump has no clue what the average American needs or wants. Has he ever stood in line at the DMV? Lived in a 4th floor walk up in the city with no A/C in a sweltering summer? Had to decide rather to buy needed meds or food? Received welfare? He has no fucking idea.
2838,And isn’t Trump himself a “billionaire celebrity who…is fundamentally disconnected from the interests and the problems of most Americans”?
2839,You are the Trump nonsense whisperer. 
2840,No endorsement. You’re the endorsement.
2841,"If you take away racism and misogyny from the population, this election would be a landslide victory for Kamala Harris. That's how you know Trump's side is bad, and so are all his followers. Ignorant, misinformed, uneducated, gullible bigots.

How anyone can be undecided is beyond me."
2842,This needs to be broadcast.
2843,I always hated that bullshit line about talking with them or reaching out to them. Magats are gone. A very small fraction of them will be able to see their ways and reluctantly start to support Haley or some normal republicans (if they even exist in 2026) but the ones with flags and hats and rally tickets would rather die than admit they were wrong or misled. Not all Republican voters are maga tho and that’s an important thing to remember. This isn’t about democrat vs Republican when I say they’re irredeemable it’s about Maga vs America.
2844,Do you really think he'll be around in 2028?
2845,">  It may not be one fought with weapons

When Trump loses (get out and vote, it's not guaranteed), you just wait. They're willing to storm the capital, and their idol is only getting crazier. Losing twice might be too much for him. If the order comes down from him to take to the streets, you can bet your ass the crazies will obey"
2846,Let's not forget they voted for a Hollywood actor and a former reality tv star for president.
2847,Travis must be so proud.
2848,Why am I imagining it as a wrestling Tag team match? 😂
2849,Clearly ever person in America attends Trump rallies (330 million in population)
2850,"""Look at our caps. Are we the baddies?"""
2851,That requires introspection that they avoid at all costs less their entire identity collapse like a trump contractor deal.
2852,I really don't think he's capable of seeing negative consequences to his actions. It's like a mental blind spot
2853,And Ted Nugent!
2854,I only wish Kamala had called him weird and said something about his best friend Jeffrey Epstein. The meltdown would have been way worse.
2855,and schools that have libraries!
2856,Green M and Ms.
2857,Sometimes it's like they don't understand basic cause and effect. What did they think she would do?
2858,"Swift has played to bigger audiences than Trump’s 2016 EC winning majority.  Even if her endorsement doesn’t sway a single voter on who they vote for if she can motivate even 0.01% of her fans to go from non voting to voting, she’s swung the election."
2859,They’re just a continuation of the Tea Party. They lost it in 2008 when we elected a black guy.
2860,He had it?
2861,[Can you imagine the crowd sizes?](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/1edneec/swifties_gathered_outside_the_stadium_in_munich/)
2862,"Or, worse, how much she makes off them."
2863,You know he will say they are AI generated
2864,FOX news should be banned for pretending to be a US news outlet!
2865,Is that the part that does the talking? I just assumed JD couldn’t speak for himself…
2866,"My fave response to it so far has been ""you don't bring a Kid Rock to a Taylor Swift fight""."
2867,The heavy guns have yet to come out.
2868,Don't forget musk sees himself as a badass.  He grew up fighting according to his comments when he was gonna fight Facebook guy
2869,They’re scared of the size of her following.  Conservatives only win elections by suppressing participation and maximizing the activation of their minority.  Anything that gets more people involved in politics and voting will swamp them.
2870,"In reality, it's still a very close race, probably not a huge shift in votes. Even if the dipshits really did lose 20 million votes, let's just act like it's 50/50 still (God knows how he gets so many people to support him, but...) and mobilize friends, family etc to vote blue. 

Less than 60 days, work your asses off to make sure Trump stays ""fired""."
2871,He did.
2872,And how much they pay to watch her perform.
2873,"Unpopular Taylor Swift is an icon in decline! It's like, and you know who I'm talking about, at levels you've never seen, because the numbers I'm talking about, when really, it was a total hoax. Everybody knows, no one goes to Taylor's Marxist rallies. No one has bigger Rallies than trump. And Saudia Arabia l... adee pa do ohhhh. But you know and everybody knows Taylor Swipt has zero talent and my crowds are bigger than Elvis and I don't even have a guitar. Just my amazing speeche's just. It's the weave as they call it. I tie together 11 thousand things so that by the end it all comes together and Stephen Hawking, big man, strong man,  tears pouring down his face, he said, sir, sir, sir-sir, you have the biggest uh-brain and my IQ is the biggest, but the crime in Democrat cities is destroying the country and nobody knows about destroying countries better than me, believe me. Taylor Swift is a democrat hoax and she's allowed 45 billion mental patients, across our southern border. And my IQ is the highest and the Sleepy Taylor Swift is a losing singer and so we MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 

*PROFOUNDLY ENTHUSIASTIC APPLAUSE BY HIS CULT AUDIENCE*"
2874,Nobody goes to her concerts. Ted Nugent has the biggest crowds.
2875,"She has the best crowds…big, strong men, with tears in their eyes…"
2876,He likes to pretend.
2877,"But, he's the concept of a billionaire [taps head meme]"
2878,But he self-identifies as a billionaire 😂
2879,"Ok paper, he is, because of the legalized bribery of DJT stock."
2880,"I'm a man who doesn't have kids, which is not something I chose but more of a product of circumstances. When I was younger I saw my future self as a father, it wasn't to be. I'm OK now with the fact that it won't happen but I have to admit that it will alwyas hurt a little. Even though they were meant to insult women, I found the comments against people who don't have kids quite hurtful towards me, and all men who don't have kids. No one likes to be told that they're useless just because they couldn't reproduce."
2881,I wish someone would ask the smug fucker how much time he actually spends with his kids as opposed to paying someone else to do it. I think the American public would find that illuminating.
2882,Fuck I am so nervous about this election… This really is a make-or-break moment for the US. We could have our first female president or go back to Trump and fucking JD Vance. It’s a nail biter to say the least
2883,"I have known a number of childless women every one of them was active in their community. 

Examples. A midwife who worked in war zones helping other women have safe deliveries sometimes with a gun to her head. 
A nurse who worked in a burns ward using new techniques in skin grafting. She went on to work high up in the Red Cross. I could go on. All contributed more than JD Vance."
2884,Also that awkward donut shop visit where clearly he has zero influence on people
2885,"My wife never had kids. For a number of reasons, she has a fairly large social media following. 

It’s mind boggling how insulting his comment is, and how much of an unnecessary forced error it is for a political campaign."
2886,To which Musk responded he'd knock her up...for some reason.
2887,"Right? My half-sister is a childless dog lady. She was parentified by her alcoholic, mentally ill mom so she doesn't want kids. But she's a wonderful aunt and she is an elementary school teacher. 


A friend of mine is a childless cat lady because she's been married for over ten years and has not been able to conceive. 


This is all reminding me of when I used to be Catholic and other moms were constantly side-eyeing me or making passive aggressive comments because we were going through secondary infertility and so weren't having a kid every 1.5 years. I have seen these comments about childless women (never childless men like Lindsey Graham) from several male Catholic political figures."
2888,So a guy from rural Ohio magically goes from being a Hillbilly to investing for high wealth individuals?? Must have slept his way to the top! Peter Thiel is his mentor! The same Peter who bankrolled the lawsuit for Hulk Hogan against Gawker!  Hmm……
2889,He clearly hasn’t been paying attention to the Era’s tour and ticket prices. Like her or not anyone who can garner that level of interest and attention is impressive.
2890,what could you expect from a guy who cant  order donuts.
2891,"Oh, no, he knows.  He just has to desperately try to redefine reality around himself, because that’s what Two Scoops has been doing forever, and it works for him, so the rest of them think it’s their only path forward."
2892,You forgot on the planet EVER
2893,He’s not Theil’s laptop. It’s worse. Vance is Theil’s former blood boy.
2894,"The more I learn about fancy expensive private universities the less I trust people who brag about having gone to them. Like, my dude, why didn’t you go to a respectable public university? Were you not good enough to get in?"
2895,He's not very bright period.
2896,And Trump forced Swift's hand to announce for Harris/Walz after reposting the AI memes of TS endorsing Trump. They are so stupid.
2897,Accepting the truth of the matter while struggling to comprehend how that is possible.  🤯
2898,What happens with NASDAQ: DJT over the course of the month will be interesting.
2899,I wish he'd take his Mommy Issues to a therapist and leave our country alone.
2900,The best part of Hogan is that at a rally he tried to push the claim that trump did about Harris suddenly turned black and has been indian before that.   He then made the indian sound with his hand over his mouth and I dawned on me that he thinks she has been calling herself native American and he has no idea what India is.
2901,And Scott Baio!
2902,And Mike Lindell!
2903,Who wouldn’t want the endorsement of the man who thinks people have forgiven Chris Benoit?
2904,And Kevin Sorbo! Hercules himself!
2905,This is the most perfect description I've ever heard.
2906,I put kid rock on the radio and a sawzall appeared in my hand like some sort of white trash Excalibur
2907,"I’ve also heard, “Kid Rock makes music for guys who have every other weekend custody but don’t show up.”"
2908,"I thought it was hilarious when Trump said he preferred Brittany (Mahomes). If he’d meant Spears, ok let’s have that conversation. But Mahomes?!

Like… ok yeah first of all we all know you like whoever likes you, that’s what makes it so easy for Putin to own you. But also…. Brittany doesn’t DO anything. She’s just someone’s wife/baby momma. I get that looking pretty and popping out babies is all women are supposed to do in his mind, but how can you compare two women like that when one is a mega superstar songwriter (and I don’t even like her music!) and one is an… Instagram mom? If she’d married some guy who never got drafted no one would know who she is, and people would STILL care about who Taylor Swift is voting for. "
2909,And that Laura Groomer person.
2910,And her large Botox 💋
2911,"Some of the nicest freaks I’ve ever met were juggalos, just saying "
2912,"I'm Canadian and I had to look him up.

I'm so sorry for my country's awful contribution to the bottom of the barrel."
2913,It stuns me how many people like this guy.  He is living cringe.
2914,"Tom MacDonald has the flow, voice, and rap skills of Filthy Frank's parody SoundCloud rapper PolitikZ."
2915,"Start thinking of great Canadians, like Norm MacDonald."
2916,People have already tried to whitewash this with “but Elon doesn’t have sex he’s more of an IVF guy” yeah cuz that makes this better. Holy fuck what is wrong with people
2917,So in other words rape… nice guy
2918,... because of the implication.
2919,He deserves a punch in the mouth from her boyfriend.  I wonder if they ever end up at the same events?
2920,"Considering he said immigrants are eating pets, how much crazier can he go?"
2921,"No, no, *they* live in hell. The MAGA crowd lives in a pessimistic hell of their own design. 

That does not have to be *our* world. Keep them out of power and laugh at them while they burn in their little bubbles"
2922,Fortunately that’s not how DNA works. He has at least one daughter who’s vastly smarter than him.
2923,"It’s because she got on nbc and said, cmon guys blackface isn’t *that* bad!"
2924,"Oh yeah thats right! Sweet!

If Mango Mussolini loses Pennsylvania he is DONE!"
2925,Elder Swiftie here and we understand the importance of battleground states and are slowly spreading the word to new voters. Current goal is 20k votes in Pennsylvania.
2926,"It could for real! A few percentage points in critical swing states could end Trumpism forever and give us our first woman president.

If most of these new voters are dem votes, Trump and the MAGAs are dead in the water. :)"
2927,"I mean, we’re talking about people who thought Rage Against The Machine was pro-conservative."
2928,"And yet, by every measure, she had the most successful concert tour in history. Without them."
2929,"> they are so deep down the rabbit hole

They believe Trump's posts like holy gospel. No critical thinking exists. It is the word of God."
2930,"> It would be their tour de force, taking a precious lefty symbol from them.

When you put it that way, it makes Cheney's endorsement of Harris all the more satisfying."
2931,"I’ve seen Reddit chatter in some entertainment subs upset that she hadn’t endorsed, especially given her friendship with Brittany Mahomes, who came out in support of Trump. They thought the fact that she hadn’t endorsed meant she was secretly supporting Trump now. Some of her weirder niche fan groups have been especially chatty about it."
2932,"The way they act every time something they don't like happens or they're wrong and can't just own it is exactly why their popularity just plummets. 

Like they cannot help themselves but continue shooting themselves in their foot because they have to continue being ignorant in the face of reality like their megalomaniac narcissist leader, Trump.

At some point their whole movement became about lauding and protecting Trump's ego rather than actually representing any American interests whatsoever."
2933,"That's great to learn, but I hadn't heard about that song before now.  I don't follow Swift or listen to her music (I have nothing against her or her music: they just don't interest me), but even as someone who's merely aware of her existence, I knew that she endorsed Biden in 2020 and that Republicans in general and Vance in particular have never stopped crapping on her for it.  So I still have to wonder: her 2024 endorsement of Harris is *a surprise* to them?

And even if Kelly, Shapiro, Vance, Trump, et al. knew that she was never going to endorse Trump and are just performatively outraged, the smart thing—or not even the smart thing: the not dumb thing—to do would be to say nothing about it.  It's got plenty of oxygen on its own; don't give it any more.  If asked, just blow it off and say something like, ""It's a shame we won't be getting her vote, but we'll soldier on without her.""  But this is the Stupid Party, and they can never allow a grievance to go unaired."
2934,They didn’t learn from Dixie chicks?
2935,"Its the whole ""we are the silent majority!!!"" delusion in action.


Same with how that crowd also thinks go woke = go broke. Because they genuinely cannot understand that most (quote) ""Woke"" (unquote) media put out by corporate entities can, indeed, turn a profit despite being boycotted by anyone who refuses to watch media with prominent black/gay/neuro-divergent/handicapped/etc characters.


Becuause they refuse to believe they are the niche weirdos. Because they insist most everyone is like them, only cowed into silence by satanic communists, and that they are simply vocal/brave enough to speak their truth.


It's mind numbing just writing about it."
2936,She might have if they hadn't used her AI likeness.
2937,"Yea, no one with half a brain is surprised who she's voting for.  But these days politics is so contentious, the ""smart"" move (in terms of making the most money) for an artist is to just not say anything."
2938,"2 minutes with the mic isn’t enough time to do his “weave” move and tie 9 points together in a broken, illogical way that mimics circular logic. So of course he couldn’t even begin to build a mountain of lies to cover his subsurface truths.

Edit: changed wave for weave"
2939,TIL palingenetic ultranationalism exists [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palingenetic\_ultranationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palingenetic_ultranationalism)
2940,"I can’t stomach this shit anymore. We are a nation of ink and parchment, not rhetoric and manipulation of public opinion to grasp for power. An individual this close to an alternative for POTUS is sickening."
2941,Can someone do a welfare check? Last I heard all she has is a little bit of money set aside for a rainy day and her cats.
2942,Why does it only work when the left cancels?! Clearly a conspiracy by blood drinking democrats since MAGA is clearly the majority representation of the country and not just... weird.
2943,"Artists like her don't make any money from albums -- its just statistical noise, because no one really buys them anymore. 

As long as there's even one person at each of her concerts that wasn't able to get a ticket and wanted to, she's not going to lose a penny."
2944,The GOP thinks that young women literally anywhere like them. They do not.
2945,"His own daughter called it a “heinous incel comment.”

You heard it hear folks. Musk’s own daughter thinks he is a “heinous incel.”"
2946,Manipulating American gullible assholes.
2947,Look what they made her do
2948,Hey man that’s not fair… Trump has surely received welfare in the form of corporate subsidies and tax breaks.
2949,"I mean I don't know how much more has to be said before people will wake up. It's not surprising to me that dems and libs want to try to high road this thing once again, a strategy that has proven time and time again not to work. Republicans and MAGA are consistently willing to sink to new lows every time an opportunity presents itself. Hell just the other day we found out that internet influencers like tim pool were literally being paid to broadcast russian propaganda all over the internet for YEARS. Shit that has spread like wildfire right to Trumps mouth hole. For 20+ years we have been talking about how you can never win a war in the middle east because you are fighting an ideology, not a nation. This is exactly the same war we are fighting here at home, exactly the same war that the Germans fought before WW2 started, and ultimately lost. If we don't want that future for us here in the US, we have to stop playing this game like as if we can negotiate with these people. People do not take his words seriously enough, Project 2025, suspending the constitution, dictatorship, alliances with north korea and russia, these are all real propositions that his people support."
2950,"Not to mention her biggest audience demographic are young women, the same demographic they're currently trying to take away all rights from.  While they're there trying to squash women's rights, Swift is there empowering them and reminding them that they have a voice."
2951,And how they stay till the end of her concerts.
2952,"And when her show is cancelled due to terrorist threats they take to the streets and sing her entire, three-hour setlist word for word."
2953,"9.5/10

- Starts out incredibly strong, bonus points for ""And Saudia Arabia l... adee pa do ohhhh.""  Excellent detail.

- ""sir, sir, sir-sir"" I might have missed this one in his actual ""form of speech"" but it seems unusual to me (I very well might have missed this one).

- ""but the crime in Democrat cities is destroying the country and nobody knows about destroying countries better than me, believe me.""  Close!  But he would say that only he (or one of his heroes like Putin, Kim, Orban) could save these countries.

- Throughout, and especially toward the end it's a bit *too* coherent.  There are several complete sentences.  One of my tests is to read it in his voice, and toward the end it becomes far too coherent, such that I had to break voice. That's why I'm docking you a half point.

Overall, well done!"
2954,The fact that I’m not 100% sure this is satire and not a direct quote from a person running for president makes me sad 🥺
2955,Needs a “my daughter is hotter” line.
2956,You forgot the part about how her followers will eat your dogs and cats!
2957,"Nobody goes to her concerts. ~~Ted Nugent~~ Kid Rock has the biggest crowds.

FTFY"
2958,"Don't forget Kid Rock!

Biggliest crowds. Yuge crowds"
2959,Billionaire cosplayer
2960,Yes. If he knew what a pronoun is.
2961,Exactly.
2962,His bio has bill / ionaire
2963,"I saw someone commented to you about it taking a village, so I just wanted to encourage you to consider an organization like big brothers, big sisters- something that offers you the ability to  mentor and support a child in need. 

My husband had a big brother as a kid (his father wasn’t around). He’s still in my husband’s life today, and he and his wife (no children themselves) stop by often to see our son. 

It had such a tremendous positive impact on my husband that I just like to drop my two cents on it whenever possible. "
2964,"Yes. I will soon have my second child, which seemed utterly unbelievable just a few years ago - just one seemed impossible. I've met so many people who've had trouble conceiving, were devastated by a miscarriage or a stillbirth, or just never managed to find the right partner in time. These comments are utterly callous to both women and men."
2965,"I hope you have or will find ways to scratch that ‘fatherhood’ itch. It takes a village, and both parents and kids can really use the assistance."
2966,Yeah I’m a dude that CANT have kids. I want to be a father. My sympathy prize is I bust wherever
2967,"I know people who are married to guys like that and they are very much “child raising is left to the woman”. Like, their kids are 2.5 and have only changed a diaper maybe a handful of times. Dont know who the pediatrician is. Cant make a bottle. 

So based on that, I’m gonna assume this dude is the “I’m gonna sign the check for you soccer registration, but I’m not going to be bothered to show up to your game” energy."
2968,"Well he said he yelled at his kid when he was on the phone with Trump because his kid was trying to talk to him about Pokémon. 

So he’s not father of the year"
2969,"Yeah he got mad and told his little boy to shut up when the child was trying to talk about a little thing that interests him. That was heartbreaking to me for some reason. Probably because my little 5 year old grandson does the same thing and if I told him to shut up and basically go away…ughhh, his lil feelings be so hurt 😔"
2970,"He doesn't pay someone, he said that's a grandparent's job."
2971,I don't even live in the US and I 100% feel the same.
2972,"It's 2016 all over again, this time with brighter colors and a prettier face. As a natural skeptic, I expect the worst and hope for the best until seeing outcomes to fruition. It's the only way to live in America with lots of responsibilities and keep one's sanity, Republicans shouldn't receive 30% of the overall vote with their *literal* 18th-19th century policies, yet they receive more."
2973,"I'm feeling more confident by the day that Harris will win.

I'm NOT confident that trump/the GOP won't try some fuckery like J6, but Trump has had a disastrous couple of months. He seemingly had it in the bag, then was totally unprepared for what should've been an obvious possibility of running against Harris. And his campaign is stepping on rakes at each turn. The Arlington incident will affect his support among veterans/active duty, which he desperately needs.

He's going to lose, I don't think it'll be all that close. It's just a matter of what they'll try to do to overturn it."
2974,"Man, eyes are on the US, this is a historical moment in the making.

The first woman president of the USA will win and the world will rapidly open up and let go of racism, sexism, homophobia and communist/war on terror “the bogeyman” panic once and for all.

Or not and we might begin to witness the fall of the USA, like the fall of Rome, and enter into a second 
Renaissance after a long period of dark ages after World War III.

Its a great and also frightening time to be alive!"
2975,I'm still just shocked that this is even a close race. Like the fact that half our country is living in this alternate reality where Trump is their hero and they believe anything he says just boggles my mind still.
2976,"Childless women don't have to be heroes. They just have to be themselves. That's great that those women you're referencing lived lives that reflect as meaningful to you, but you can just be a regular ass woman who doesn't want kids and loves eating chips on the couch and gardening and be happy and worthy."
2977,JD Vance orders donuts like he’s wearing a wire.
2978,Okay...good
2979,I’m in cat rescue and know a LOT of childless cat ladies and we’re pissed
2980,"It's the conservative mindset, not just JD Vance. He's merely saying one of their proudest talking points out loud, seriously."
2981,"But Kid Rock, now that guy is making waves with the voters!"
2982,*Whatever makes sense.
2983,"I've never followed a stock so closely, even when I owned a few of them."
2984,"Whatever happens, trump still comes out of top, because he was gifted all that stock, so it's 100% profit no matter the price."
2985,Jesus Christ. There goes another piece of my childhood. 
2986,"He didn't think that.  He was making an extra racist joke by deliberately conflating the two.  If you watch the video,  he's clearly seeing up that joke and the ""how"" thing was punchline because it's ""Indian but the wrong kind of Indian."" Is literally the ""joke."" It goes right along with him deliberately mispronouncing her name.  Same type of ""humor,""  same basic dipshit racist attitude. 

It's a terrible,  unfunny racist ""joke"" that only a scumbag like Hogan would make, but it was definitely intentional which maybe makes it worse."
2987,That would be hilarious if it wasn’t so horribly racist.
2988,Nobody ever claimed the WWF was smart...I think...
2989,What an incredible way to tell on yourself.
2990,Qevin Sorbo too.
2991,And Robert “Teddy Bear” Kennedy!
2992,I'm in the Netherlands at the moment and 'Sorbo' is the name of a common brand of cheap sponges and rags. Every time I see them this guy is dragged back into my memory and I feel that same little burst of tired disgust again and again
2993,"Just fyi, Botox just paralyzes muscles in the face to prevent wrinkles. Fillers are what she has in her lips. I’m sure literally nobody cares, but I just thought I’d throw it out there."
2994,I had a friend who blasted his song about being an oppressed white male and he legitimately thought it was a banger 🤮
2995,"I read some woman (probably a bot) suggest she should be flattered because Elon is ""rich and handsome."" Rich, yes. As to the other 🤢🤮 "
2996,"People have identified strongly with the idea that being an Elon Musk enthusiast means you too are smart; However,  it turns out Elon is a moron  and people's egos are bruised and the only way to stop that bruising from continuing is to defend his bullshit.

There are others who thought he was cool and his cars were cool...imagine if you just spent 100k on a cyber truck which has Elon as a poster boy? Kind of embarrassing really but it would be better to tell yourself the guy is ok in this case."
2997,"But why would you want short, flabby, weird looking dude sperm when you could have 6’5”, athletic, attractive man sperm?"
2998,He'll probably send a horse as consolation
2999,You just know that Elon thinks IASIP is hilarious AND completely misses the point that the gang are terrible people.
3000,Illegal aliens getting transgender surgeries in prison?
3001,Legit not even the craziest of the things he’s said.
3002,Let’s be clear. He only had a concept of immigrants eating pets.
3003,That's a good name!  I've been using Mango Unchained!
3004,"Every state where we can win with clearly overwhelming number is so damn important.

MAGA is still going to try and pull every trick to steal this election and we cannot allow them to have any chance."
3005,Thank you so much for your service to democracy! You are fighting the good fight for all of us.
3006,"see also: The Boys, Star Wars, The Matrix. Media literacy is not their strong suit."
3007,Don’t forget that they believe that twisted sisters “were not going to take it” is a conservative anthem about fighting against being woke…I wish I were making this shit up
3008,"*Some of those that work forces are the same that burn crosses*


""He's cheering for us!"""
3009,It's bullshit on parade.
3010,They probably also think *Fortunate Son* is very patriotic and pro-war
3011,"Cheney shows this isn't even left vs right with moderates cheering on the side anymore, its MAGA vs literally everyone else."
3012,"Those people are bonkers. It's impossible to know anything about Taylor Swift and think she would ever support Donald Trump. She's written entire protest songs about him (""Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince"", for one)"
3013,"I lurk pretty heavy on one of those subs, but the sentiment is more like ""Her original political stance in her 'documentary' was opportunist, and while Biden worked in the moment, she's too detached, vain, and wealthy now, and an endorsement of any candidate has more downside than upside so she's potentially a self interests coward."" So they believed sitting it out to be brand oriented."
3014,Insert principal skinner meme here...
3015,"That's exactly it. Some (most?) conservatives around me imagine that a liberal is someone below 25, college student, LGBT or ""pretending to be"", with tattoos/blue hair/piercings etc. They see and know only few such people, therefore ""liberals"" must be a small minority. They don't understand that most liberals are working and middle-class people with jobs, families, homes, hobbies, and that they come in every color. I'm a straight white man and some people have trouble believing that I hate trumpism."
3016,"This is it, exactly. I work construction and a staggering number of my coworkers believe the vast majority of the country is hard conservative but afraid and/or bullied into hiding it. They see themselves as courageous heroes bravely saying ""what everyone is thinking"".

Oh, and for the record a lot of them have jumped on the whole ""immigrants eating dogs"" nonsense. I overheard a millwright yesterday swearing up and down that it's true and his neighbor behind him has been doing it for years. Some people, man."
3017,“weave”.
3018,"Good, he already gattling guns lies when he stays focused (see Biden debate)


So him not being able to add a weave in his excellent "
3019,"> palingenetic

Boy I'm glad that wasn't referring to Caribou Barbie."
3020,I'm reading this as bare-minimum fascism
3021,"Soon it'll be at the point where she has to eat the cats, like a translegal asylumigrant."
3022,"because MAGA falls into two groups - super rich who don't pay for anything and make up a tiny minority, and the ultra-poor conspiracy nuts who don't have the capital to make an impact in the market."
3023,She could lose half her fans and still sell out stadiums. It's nearly impossible to get tickets to her shows.
3024,Mostly All Gross Assholes
3025,"Kamala knows the games he plays, All Too Well"
3026,"> For 20+ years we have been talking about how you can never win a war in the middle east because you are fighting an ideology, not a nation.

This is both an eloquent and utterly chilling description of the situation we’re in.  An absolutely scary situation."
3027,"> internet influencers like tim cook 

This is neither here nor there, but I think you mean Tim Pool? No way Tim Apple needs money from Russia lol"
3028,I think you mean Tim Pool. Tim Cook only spreads Apple propaganda.
3029,"Ive been screaming this and getting downvoted. Relinquishing this country to Trump under any circumstance is a death sentence for America. Their ideology is just to oppose discussion, decency, and unity in order to sow chaos and confusion. They have almost no fixed beliefs or values. It’s just a cult of hate and shamelessness. They aren’t going to be running a peaceful functioning society. It would be transformative and revolutionary, in ways we could only envision in our worst nightmares. Conceding this election to Trump would be synonymous with giving up on democracy and Western Society. It’s not an option."
3030,And how she has a cat
3031,He says sir sir sir   A utility to buy more time to think of what he’s saying next
3032,"Absolutely, his ""Sir stories"" are a trademark."
3033,"> Starts out incredibly strong, bonus points for ""And Saudia Arabia l... adee pa do ohhhh."" Excellent detail.
> 
> 

Is that an actual reference to something? I'd love to hate-watch it if so"
3034,He frequently says that grown men come up to him with tears in their eyes saying “sir sir sir” and thanking him for saving the country
3035,this is brilliant
3036,A stupid persons idea of a rich man
3037,Concept of a billionaire.
3038,Comic Con(vict)
3039,I identify as a billionaire
3040,Are those his pronouns
3041,Who's cutting all those onions in here??
3042,"I was a troubled kid and I had 4 different bigs. I loved getting to go out places as I was brought up in the cult of religion(apostolic pentacostle) so got to experience things like baseball games and fishing. 

Unfortunately, my temper got me kicked out of the program. All of my bigs were not parents and they had no idea how to deal with troubled kids with anger issues. So after 4 bigs they just kicked me out. 

Granted this was the 90s so they probably much better now at pairing kids and bigs. 

I look back at it now fondly and with a fair bit of cringe."
3043,Would you call that a participation trophy?
3044,"What makes it worse is that they will \*proudly\* say how they don't know how to do those things, even to the point of minimizing it (i.e. claim they have never so much as seen the inside of a diaper even if they have changed one a few times) and try to shame males who admit to having done any of it. 

While also complaining about how ""Urban"" males don't help raise kids."
3045,"He calls his own kids ""her kids"" when talking about his wife and them. And referred to his newborn as an ""it""."
3046,Fuckthemkids elegy
3047,"Fair. If two scoops wins again, the country 💯 will melt into a very painful recession that is all but guaranteed to turn into a depression and tank the global economy"
3048,I wasn't afraid of Trump in 2016. I definitely am in 2024. I'm hoping that many other moderates feel the same way.
3049,I'm confident they *will* try election interference and another J6.
3050,"I agree, we own nothing to anyone."
3051,"Thankfully, I'll never watch JD Vance order donuts. Paint drying is more interesting."
3052,"Are you selling the cats to immigrants so they can eat? /s

Yeah that was the moment I knew Harris had gotten to the small handed ex-billionaire"
3053,I guess waves of nausea counts.
3054,"[https://kidrock.com/pages/tour](https://kidrock.com/pages/tour)

Kid Rock is on tour! His only booked tour date is ""tucker carlson live"" on 9/20.

Can't make this shit up man. LOL."
3055,Meth…he’s making meth with the voters..
3056," ""OK, good."""
3057,"Stick a fork in it, it’s done!"
3058,It's owed to someone already.... He's just a middle man for that cash
3059,The ONLY comfort I get out of even knowing that is there are stupid followers of his who threw all kinds of $$$ at this stock thinking they’re going to get a huge payout and fuck the Libs!
3060,Andre ( my hero) was right about him. Should have smushed his face more.
3061,"I've said it so many times lately,  Hulk Hogan has never beaten an opponent as badly as he's beaten my childhood."
3062,You either die a face or live long enough to become a heel.
3063,"For real, I’m 47 and was a total Hulkster when I was a kid in the 80s."
3064,"Meh. 

Undertaker was cooler."
3065,Hogan also ratted to management when Jesse Ventura tried to unionize the wrestlers.
3066,"Hogan is near the bottom of that barrel.  There are wrestlers who were and are better performers, better educated and just way better people than him.  Some of them are dumb as rocks (look at hogan) but  I don't think it's fair to put them all at the bottom with a loser like him."
3067,"And probably Theodore “Ted” Bundy too, though I admit dead people voting might be a bit on brand for them"
3068,He's like a mentally impaired Bond Villan
3069,I doubt wealth gap between Swift and Musk prevents her from doing anything she wants.
3070,"How sexual assault used to be handled waived.  “They’re handsome, you should feel lucky.”"
3071,"Because if there's one thing Taylor Swift needs, its money from the guy who tanked Twitter."
3072,Flattered over Elon when she has TRAVIS KELCE?!
3073,She's also a billionaire. She doesn't need his money 🤡
3074,Well billionaires do keep trying to create the Torment Nexus.
3075,"Seriously. The only difference was that he said it on live TV with no way to spin it.

People were just forced to comprehend his raw output, which just instantly reminded everyone that watched that he's a nutjob"
3076,So many people seem to so easily forget all the batshit things he said and did while in office. Nuking hurricanes? Injecting bleach? Deploying tanks to roam the streets of DC? Seizing arms without due process?
3077,Transgender operations on illegal alien prisoners.
3078,More like Mango Unbrained.
3079,I like it! :)
3080,"Literacy in general isn't, I'm afraid 🤷"
3081,Steven Colbert
3082,Especially the punisher. Ol Frank would be struggling to keep ammo supplied with all this fuckery afoot.
3083,Add Star Trek to that list. Still blows my mind that a show which preaches acceptance and embracing of diversity and different ways of being and thinking attracts super conservative fans
3084,"I'll agree completely that media literacy (hell any literacy) isn't their strong suit. 

But the bigger problem is the delusion. They don't *get* the dynamic of the story because they mistakenly see themselves as the underdog, the plucky band of people fighting against The Big Bad. 

I'm not sure any amount of media literacy would fix that. They'd simply have fancier words to describe, in their collective delusion, how they're not the bad guys but the rebels fighting against oppression."
3085,Heck it took them 3-4 seasons of The Boys to realise Homelander was the bad guy.
3086,"I introduced a friend to The Boys and he was like ""wow, they really aren't subtle with their parody here"" and I'm thinking bud this is as subtle as the show gets, it's MUCH more blatant every season. To the point that season 4 was so on the nose it felt lazy."
3087,... On my way to listen to and watch the vid again but I could have sworn this was the one they all cross dress in.
3088,They probably think the song is celebrating bluelivesmatter and kkk
3089,"""Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me!"" 

""Yeah man! Fuck the Dems! Don't tread on me!"""
3090,There is no probably. They think 'fortunate son' and 'born in the usa' are patriotic.
3091,If you told me in high school I'd be voting with Dick Cheney in 2024 I probably would have asked you for some of your drugs. 
3092,"As fascist movements always go. List enemies for long enough, you'll end up fighting yourselves."
3093,"Yup. Democratic party has been a big tent party for a long time, and the tent keeps getting bigger as the GOP veers even harder right. Democrats are basically all the sane people, GOP became only hard right extremists."
3094,"To be fair, MAGA critical thinking skills are so low that we’re not talking about them not understanding anything between the lines, but the stuff that’s on the lines, too."
3095,"Also, You Need to Calm Down"
3096,The greedy and grifted
3097,Now they have Bad Blood.
3098,"I don't think it scares enough people to be honest. I have experienced firsthand the kind of behavior we thought only came from the middle east 20 years ago in people very close to me over this ""MAGA"" stuff and Trump himself. I have had family members who have known me since birth 40+ years ago that HATE my guts for nothing more than the fact that I don't support Trump. Both myself, family and friends have all lost friends and family over these last two election cycles over this guy. When I tell you the parallels to Germany pre ww2 are so scary its hard to believe. I studied alot of history in my time and I have to say one of the most fascinating things about ww2 is not the war itself, but how an entire people turned on each other, family, friends and neighbors and became a xenophobic murder squad for one man."
3099,Lol Yes. 
3100,"Three cats, according to my 7 year old daughter."
3101,I think it’s more to show how fawning and obsequious everyone is toward him.
3102,It’s when his brain starts buffering. There’s some packet loss then the stream picks up again but packets are out of order.
3103,"*Looks at Musk*

I dont know, seems pretty accurate to me."
3104,A poor persons idea of a smart man
3105,Washed up game show host.
3106,"I never understood that mentality. My wife and I had a deal: she handled the input (breastfeeding), I handled the output (diapers). Seemed like a fair arrangement, but then again we're rational adults :shrug:"
3107,And any time he spends solo parenting is babysitting.
3108,Shit on a shingle why is this guy so fucking weird
3109,"It might be worth a watch, just so you can then watch Tim Walz be adorably charming when he was in Pennsylvania, picking up some whoopie pies (I think they're called that, not sure).  He even jokes about not having any trouble picking out donuts."
3110,"OMG. Was that Dump’s version of outreach to childless cat ladies, in attempt to draw them in? Ladies, stick with me, I’ll protect your cats from the scary hungry immigrants."
3111,"Iron Sheik too. Should have broke his back, made him humble."
3112,"Not to ruin your day, but Andre was also famously racist.  Bad News Brown and Kamala (not that one) both threatened to fight him about it."
3113,I met Andre on a flight when I was a kid. He absolutely terrified me. I sat next to him in first class. He signed a barf bag for me. It is truly one of my greatest memories.
3114,"Was more of a Rick Flair kinda kid, but people that did not live through the 80's have _no idea_ how prevalent Hogan was."
3115,"I was his fan after watching Hogan Knows Best. 

Should have picked up on his shitty self when he put a gps tracker on his daughter’s car to tail her on a date. But had no problem giving his you her son pointers on how to pick up girls."
3116,Also a Trump supporter
3117,"Love him or hate him, John Cena has come off as sweet, kind, charitable, has done quite well financially outside wrestling, and graduated college."
3118,More like an Austin Powers villain really
3119,He would be Dr. Evil if he hadn't spent thousands on hair replacement.
3120,Perfect description!! 😮
3121,I'm still waiting for Marvel to wipe his cameo from Iron Man 2.
3122,"Right? Taylor already has a silly amount of money, I don't think she's likely to be moved by what Elon has to offer."
3123,"Travis is by all accounts a nice guy and too smart to do this, but there's a decent chance he and Elon will be at some event together in the future. I'd love it if he knocked his block off. Only a rich narcissist thinks he can insult a professional football player's girlfriend with impunity. It would be so nice if he were disabused of the notion."
3124,"I had a conservative friend tell me how much they agreed with the Colbert report fully aware that he was using strawman and bad arguments to troll those ideas. 

It still didn't make him question the premise, it just reinforced his beliefs regardless."
3125,"Punisher: I only have to take justice into my own hands because the cops are fuckin useless

Real cops: YEAH THIS GUY GETS IT"
3126,"How the hell did they warp *Star Trek* into conservative? 

I can see Star Wars - on the surface you could read it as ""small rebellion against oppressive government"" - but how the hell do you get conservative out of *TREK*?"
3127,“You mean I’m going to vote for a gun owning cop endorsed by Cheney in my forties? Holy shit I am gonna become a republican?”
3128,But does she have a couch?
3129,"I love the fact that a 7yo knows this.  It's so funny how they choose which random bits of information to hold on to.   
  
Adults hope their kids retain things like the times tables and the US state capitols, but they defy us at every turn with things like whether or not the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have middle names and how many cats Taylor Swift owns."
3130,No ones *that* stupid
3131,"No, Musk is a stupid person's idea of a smart man"
3132,"He probably never solo parents at all. Either has nannies to do it for him or call his mother-in-law. He commented once that one of the ""perks"" of marrying an Indian woman is how the grandmother looks after the grandkids. *""Weird, unadvertised feature of marrying an Indian woman""* was the exact quote.

Because apparently no other grandmothers do it, only Indian grandmothers. Says the guy who was raised by his grandmother. Absolutely lack of self awareness."
3133,Ultimate Warrior was also a racist prick. Turns out the heels were the good guys after all.
3134,I forgot about Kamala the wrestler for a second and thought a presidential candidate threatened to fight Andre
3135,"Kamala the Ugandan Giant, managed by the great Skandor Akbar.   I love my Texas upbringing, watching World Class Wrestling, but I have never been stupid enough to vote Republican..."
3136,Awesome
3137,"Never liked his character much personally, but I do think he was a good performer, and he seems well liked by people who worked with him.   I do think there's a lot of shit that's hard to reconcile with how nasty the WWE has been at the leadership level and all the higher level performers in regards to how much they knew about and what they may or may not have kept quite about, no matter how good they seem outside the business.   But hey, I keep watching the shit even knowing how gnarly the business is.   

Also Mankind was the greatest wrestler of all time."
3138,And then there's Dave Bautista.
3139,Even gave us a sweet mandarin lesson.
3140,Dr Evil and Goldmember were much more intelligent than Elmo
3141,I heard thats part of the reason he stopped
3142,"It's Olympic level mental gymnastics, for sure. That's why I am always floored when I come across them 

I think maybe they just like the space battles and ignore everything else? idk"
3143,"The only angle I can think of is TNG and DS9 very heavily implied the Federation had gone too far towards pacifism (sometimes leaning ""no the Federation has this right"" and sometimes the other way). That sometimes you need to shoot the bad guys with photon torpedoes and push until you have a real peace rather than bending over backwards for a quick ceasefire and objectional peace.

Of course that isn't necessarily a conservative realisation. Though a lot of conservatives really think liberal minded people think that way."
3144,"Time traveller: ""No, you won't be a Republican because they support Russia and higher taxes. You will condemn them by waving the American flag in their face as law enforcement slowly rounds them up after they sack the capitol.""

Me 20 years ago: WTAF?"
3145,Why would she need one? I heard she’s in a relationship?
3146,"Leonardo Yoshi, Donatello Giovanni, Raphael Firenzi and Michelangelo Jiacobbe.  Their last name is Hamato.  I'm seven at heart."
3147,I’m not a psycologist. But I could see the people who’s ego’s aren’t so massive that they NEED to be the hero of the story being the nicer people
3148,John Cena was originally a heel if I recall correctly. But became a main star later on. He seems pretty cool. I don't know enough about Batista but maybe he's ok?
3149,"More awesome if he barfed in it, then signed it"
3150,"Watch some of the behind the scenes/outtakes for peacemaker. He's legitimately hilarious.

I've never watched wrestling so I only really know him from the movies and shows he's done and he seems like a genuinely good guy.

There is also the fact that he has done something like 600 wishes from the make-a-wish foundation"
3151,"WWE post Vince feels like a genuinely refreshed company.  Vince was straight up as horrible a human as you could find, *but* was responsible for taking his dad’s regional competition and turning it into a behemoth of a company that swallowed all the competition.

I’m super glad he’s gone, and hope he never returns and has any influence, Levesque and Khan appear to be having a blast, have been mending relationships with good wrestlers that Vince threw out, and are running from strength to strength.

Edit: Mick Foley was indeed the greatest wrestler of all time.  I wouldn’t ever skip watching Stone Cold, Bret Hart or Diamond Dallas Page though!  (DDP and …the guy we don’t mention… were never Stone Cold big but were such engagingly entertaining wrestlers I’d always be hyped for them to fight.  I forget sometimes how boring fights can be, then you get the likes of Gunther and Randy Orton last weekend when they just kind of slapped each other a bunch, maybe a couple of clothes lines, and eventually a submission.  Dull as fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck)."
3152,You mean Leon?
3153,"I assume it's the military trappings. There's a command structure, everyone is on a mission together. The captain is thoughtful, but nearly always right, and will break the rules when he feels he must.

Maybe if you don't pay much attention to the larger scope of the setting, and if you really just pay attention to the episodes involving more direct conflicts, it doesn't feel like a show set in a post-capitalist galaxy."
3154,Vance also has a wife. Gotta keep a side-piece
3155,In waiting room for dr and this made me cackle. Worth the annoyed looks lol
3156,"Speaking as someone who has been in theater quite a bit, it’s ALWAYS more fun to be the villain."
3157,"Batista is actually quite liberal, from what I saw when I was still on twitter. I remember re-tweeting him quite often because he’s also pretty funny."
3158,Anybody want a peanut?
3159,I think he'd need more than one bag...
3160,On Peacemaker when he was rattling off all those names of people to call was so fucking funny.
3161,So... an Ottoman?
3162,"Val Kilmer goes into this in Val. He was so excited to play Batman. What kid doesn’t role play as Batman? Dream job. But he couldn’t move in the suit. Has a mask, so a lot of facial acting gone. 

The villains had all the fun."

3164,The fact the repubs are running a nut job for governor has to help the cause!
3165,If she wins NC. It’s an early end to the election. We can all relax and go to bed.
3166,Rally in Charlotte:  https://www.youtube.com/live/j52C5uGVhRs
3167,The polling looks promising for North Carolina.
3168,"I have family in state politics in NC (Democrats) and they say that this is very much indeed a possibility, due in large part to Mark Robinson, the GOP candidate for governor who is an absolute troglodyte. He is giving the Dems momentum and getting out the Dem vote which could swing the state."
3169,"Fantastic to see her spending time and resources in NC.  IMO it’s the most likely flip she can pick up, and I’m including Georgia in there.  Robinson is a trainwreck of a candidate and polling currently clearly shows she has a strong chance of taking advantage of that and peeling off enough split-voters to win the state.  Plenty split their vote, sure, but when you have a double-digit disparity you can probably peel 2% of those voters away if you put work into it.

I honestly think NC has the potential to be a sleeper hit for this election.  If she manages to win it, it opens up a ton of new paths to victory while cutting the vast majority of Trump’s off at the knees; and it also takes a tremendous amount of pressure off PA.  If wouldn’t necessarily be an early night, but it’d be an easy night, if NC was called for Harris."
3170,Time to revive that Petey Pablo song.
3171,She cracked donald like an egg!
3172,Now campaign in Florida and Texas 
3173,"And right on cue the NC supreme court and RFK jr fire up the fuckery machine. Mail ballots will be delayed so he can have his name removed. Just total partisan bullsh. If youre in NC i hope this pisses you off enough to register or help get out the vote. As the great Paul Mooney once said, “this shit ain’t by no goddamn accident”"
3174,Trump must win NC to get to 270.
3175,"Yea, that's what I wanted to come here and say. If anyone is worse than Trump, it would be Mark Robinson.

Trump won NC with like 74 000 votes."
3176,I just moved to NC last summer and I’m feeling a mixture of optimism and absolute dread. Everything I hear says there’s enough dislike for Robinson to drive enough people to the polls to vote for Stein and Harris but oh boy the idea that they’ll lose makes me queasy.
3177,"Considering Republican willingness for shenanigans, merely winning is not enough. It must be a crushing victory!"
3178,"Yup, hoping for this."
3179,"Not so sure. If you give Harris MI, NC, AZ, and NE-02, that's 269.  Still need one more state.  I'm banking on NV or WI.  PA seems way to close and GA looks to be coming up short.  The election day coverage should give us an idea about enthusiasm/voter turnout.  



Either way I'm taking the next day off work because I'll be up way too late waiting for results"
3180,"Unfortunately not. It certainly would open up a lot of paths for her, but if she were to lose PA (and let's assume she holds MI and WI, which could be a stretch since they vote similarly to PA), then she would need 2 of NC, GA, NV, or AR to get to 270. So PA is still by far the most important state."
3181,"Not quite an end, but yeah it makes the night very cushy.  Trump could still easily win if he takes PA, but the road there would be narrow.  It would be heavily dependent on the unique local politics of NC driving the victory, rather than a broader groundswell of support for Harris that wins her other key states; and even then it could be real trouble considering it’s a dynamic that is mirrored in AZ where they ALSO have a shitshow of a down-ballot race for the GOP."
3182,No one goes to her rallies. Why would they go to her rallies?
3183,"And that was only after the fuck face running for senate on the democratic side admitted to an affair right before election day.

That asshole keeps it in his pants and we may have won that seat and the state"
3184,Yes. Good point
3185,Harris calling out Putin as a threat to Poland if Ukraine surrenders should help with polish Americans and there are a lot of them in the Midwest and Pennsylvania.
3186,I’m just gonna go to sleep and wake up in the morning haha
3187,"Good news for you is she’s trending very well in WI. Currently  she’s 49-46. She’s also been up the whole time she’s entered the race. It’s very exciting. I don’t see how she doesn’t win WI, I have an extremely good feeling she wins NC. She might lose NV but keep AZ and MI. It looks good for her and she has multiple paths to victory. People just need stay motivated and vote."
3188,PA is more likely than NC or AZ at this point.
3189,"You’re absolutely right, but that said…the path towards 270 for Trump if she takes NC and he takes PA is far more narrow than Harris’ would be.  He’d have to sweep all three states despite Harris flipping one that *he has never lost.* 

Far from impossible….but I struggle to see NC going blue due to the drag Robinson has put on the race, for example, but at least AZ not following suit due to Lake.

Definitely not a slam dunk or a situation I would like to be in, but nonetheless a NC upset increases the odds of a broader victory exponentially."
3190,I never go anywhere that crowded.
3191,"Yeah, they'll need time to count mail-in ballots including those serving overseas. I highly doubt we'll have an answer by midnight on who won the election. These states are that close."
3192,"100%, and if she gets NC early, I would feel pretty good about her chances (post-2016 PTSD and all that prevents me from feeling any sort of optimism until the race is called). I really hope she does. I was just responding to the poster above that it wouldn't be like 2012 again, where Ohio was called for Obama early, and therefore the race, and Karl Rove had a live meltdown on Fox News.

Those were the days..."
3193,PA had passed a new law that mail-in votes/early can't be counted until after election day voting ends...it could give a sense of Trump winning which he will immediately claim fraud when they count the rest

3195,"After this debate, the fact that Harris does not get 70% of the vote is concerning.

I am starting to believe that America might be the only country in the developed world to still have a problem voting for a woman."
3196,Who the hell are the 9% of Democrats who responded and said Trump came out on top of [the debat](https://uploads.dailydot.com/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-01-at-9.57.48-AM.png?auto=compress&fm=png)!? lol
3197,"That's a good result, five points nationally is about what she'll need to win.  Not much margin though."
3198,Trump's not gonna win. So why tarnish yourself by casting your vote for a corrupt loser?
3199,Now she needs to keep hammering him for his cowardice in refusing to debate again.
3200,"wow, such good news. and with a 5% lead for Harris, this appears to be OUTSIDE the margin of error.

but remember, he won the debate /s :)"
3201,"My only worry is that these types of bumps post-debate haven’t really stuck. I’m hoping this time is different, especially with the independent voters. The VP debate may also have an impact if Walz is to beat Vance, but there’s some worry there for me, as Vance will at least be able to control himself unlike his running mate "

Be sure to vote."
3204,"I was looking at 538 and a post-debate snap poll from MI by InsiderAdvantage showed Trump +1, which is a 3 point movement in his favor.  Hopefully, they just got a weird sample, but at least the national polls are moving towards Harris."
3205,She’s doing a hell of a lot better than Biden!
3206,"If it makes you feel better, we’re hardly alone. Lots of countries still have some lingering sexism to work through."
3207,"Trolls.

I think it’s easier for closeted Trumpers to say they’re democrats and show some “leniency.”"
3208,"Have you ever watched CSPAN callers.  Right Wingers will call in on the ""Democrat"" line and lie."
3209,7% of Dems 14% of GOP will say it was two shape shifting lizards debating on stage and totally believe it.
3210,"My understanding is that high-quality polls that truly reflect the debate results won’t arrive until early next week. These are encouraging, though."
3211,"This is not true, she does not need to win the national popular vote by five (I really wish people would stop repeating this falsehood). It would be very likely she would win if she was up five, but the reality is most scenarios where she wins by 2 and especially 3+ nationally point toward her having a path to victory in the electoral college. 

I hope she wins it by five or even more to repudiate MAGA. But she doesn’t *need* to to win."
3212,Its prob around 2.5% this time around
3213,"I trust Walz will be able to call out Vance's nonsense like ""I don't think the American people care what this out of touch billionaire has to say about the election"""
3214,"InsiderAdvantage is the same as Trafalgar and Rasmussen.

It will always greatly favor Republicans, and they never release crosstabs, etc.

Pay no attention."
3215,"To be fair, Biden will certainly get a diagnose of either dementia or Parkinson’s when he’s out of office. His speech and his body movement indicate that."
3216,This is the answer!
3217,"We're splitting hairs here obviously.  If she won by five, she would win electoral college.  If she won by two or three, she might win the electoral college, she might not and there would likely be lots of bullshit and lawsuits afterwards.  Less than that, probably not.

Five is a good result, it's a win and it's not really even close enough to challenge.  That really needs to be the goal here for anyone to get a good night's sleep."
3218,"I hope so! It’ll definitely be a lot less batshit crazy statements though. Vance is going to be coached to make the campaign sound reasonable and really focus on policy lies to make the campaign sound sane. My hope is that Walz will be able to decimate him, but I think the bar is so low for Republicans that it’s going to be hard to gain any major traction from that debate"
3219,"In 2020 Insider Advantage was closest to calling Michigan correctly, with Biden +2 in the last poll. It was closer than CNBC and Emerson, which had Biden +7, and Reuters, which had Biden +10. 

The final result was Biden +2.8. "
3220,"I usually look at the movement not the overall number.  So movement was +3 for Trump from around 2 weeks ago.  Now, with sampling noise, perhaps just a weird sample in the snapshot.  While all polling was done post-debate it may not have accounted for a week of pre-debate improvement from Trump.  So, I'm not passing this one data point to say Trump is winning, just despite how well Harris debated, undecided voters are weird.

Edit:  Also, we're still not fully understanding the impact of enthusiasm, donations, and seemingly better grassroots support for the Harris-Walz ticket."
3221,"“Five points is about what she’ll need to win” is a false statement, no?"
3222,"walz is going to destroy vance. his public speaking skills are elite imo. hes very quick on his feet talking and has tons of experience.  

vance cant even order a donut or attempt to even small talk. yea i feel its gonna be another beat down for team trump/vance."
3223,"All of the Republican pollsters do that. They show a Republican winning throughout the race so the aggregators look better for fundraising or narrative and then at the end they tack back towards the crowd and show a slight Democrat lead which is usually how the popular vote shakes out. 

Then the next cycle, when they go back to showing a Republican lead in August and September, people point to them and go “but they were really accurate last time.”"
3224,"Again, you cannot trust IA even for ""trends."" They do not show trends."
3225,It’s not false. Anything five or higher exponentially increases the chances that individual states are high enough to where their averages factored into the national makes the odds resoundingly in her favor.
3226,"How is that less accurate than a D+10 lead on the eve of the election in a state that ended up being D+2.8? In the 2016 Michigan race, the infamously right-leaning Trafalgar was the only pollster to correctly call MI as going to Trump. "
3227,"Thanks, it will be good to get more reputable state-level post-debate polling."
3228,The fact that you restated it the way you did makes my point lol
3229,It is false. What’s needed to win the presidency is 270 electoral college votes. Full stop.

3231,That's not what upset her. Loomer's unfettered access to Trump is what upset her lmao
3232,">Loomer, 31, a proud Trump supporter, took aim at Vice PresidentKamala Harris in a Sunday post on X (formerlyTwitter), mocking Harris’s Indian heritage. She claimed that if Harris were elected president, “the White House will smell like curry,” and speeches would be delivered “via a call center.” These racist remarks sparked immediate outrage, with even far-right figures like Greene condemning Loomer’s words as “appalling and extremely racist.”

Further alienating and antagonizing women, minorities of all kinds, Taylor Swift fans, and every other category that is not in the MAGA base, seems like a really weird thing to do with an election roughly two months away, I guess the Republicans have some strategy involving ""turn out everyone to vote against us"" that is too complex for a mere mortal like me to understand.

>“This does not represent who we are as Republicans or MAGA,” Greene wrote, adding that Loomer’s behavior “should not be tolerated ever.”

Oh, Marjorie, bless your heart, as we used to say in the South (and still do).   

That's exactly who you are, you just don't like it when people point it out in public."
3233,Someone is butt hurt that Donnie has a new BFF.
3234,Nobody in the GOP is questioning why Loomer and Trump are traveling together.
3235,Loomer is sleeping with Trump.
3236,"This is actually the top post in that other sub, and they're dragging her there too. That's how you *know* you went too damn far."
3237,A few months ago Trump said he wanted Loomer to be his press secretary. Let that settle in for a minute. Only the best people.
3238,Confused? Don’t be. She’s just following the orders given by whoever controls the Republican Party to lay off of her race.
3239,Greene must be upset because she's not on the cover of today's conspiracy theory magazine.
3240,"Loomer seems irrelevant. She is not a serious person going on about curry, which is effing delicious."
3241,"Trump is fucking Loomer, Marge is jealous, and Lindsey learned to stay out of cat fights"
3242,This will end in a gun right.
3243,Lmao no; she waited until Trump lost the debate and needed a scapegoat.
3244,She's upset because that's supposed to be her job.
3245,Personally I believe Trump is probably fucking Laura Loomer. It's an easy way to square the fact that she's always around him.
3246,Yoko Loomer is the best thing to happen to MAGA.
3247,No. MTG is upset about Loomer's influence - this is simple jealousy.
3248,"This white supremacist is Jewish, lol."
3249,"She's just mad she didn't say it first, I think."
3250,MTG is upset because she wasn't the first to say it.
3251,MTG is just jealous that Trump had another woman she needs to complete with
3252,And when MTG commented Laura roasted her. I am so happy to see MAGA eat itself.
3253,"Ooh, the turning on each other stage. Get your popcorn, this will be fun!"
3254,"> This does not represent who we are as Republicans or MAGA,” Greene wrote

  
Loomer is traveling around with Trump. Racism is part of MAGA

3259,MTG's getting ghosted.  Trump has a new gf.
3260,"Yes Marjorie it very much *is* who you are, especially since the leader of your movement had Loomer attend the 9/11 memorial ceremony as his personal guest."
3261,That woman is 31?! Holy crap she looks at least 45
3262,"It’s not too complex to understand. The worse Trump loses, the more convinced his base will be that it’s rigged, and the angrier they will be."

\[As well as sexist, homophobic & transphobic, xenophobic, etc.\]"
3265,Actually they are. I just saw a segment on NBC and they were talking about this exact subject. A few Republicans have concerns of Loomer being in close proximity to Trump. She's a 9/11 conspiracy theorist and he took her to the 9/11 ceremony.

3304,C'mon Hot Ones!
3305,">Bakari Sellers, a longtime close ally of Harris’, said her planned barnstorming “warms the spirit of every Democrat” and should be followed up with non-traditional appearances. He wants Harris to sit with the star podcaster Bill Simmons, who founded the Ringer network and has a huge following among sports and pop culture devotees. Sellers wants to tap into the start of college football season by having Harris chit-chat with Paul Finebaum, the broadcaster and author with deep ties to the NCAA’s Southeastern Conference, whose schools overlap with a large swath of politically pivotal states across the South.

This kind of outreach is crucial and I'm glad to see the Harris campaign go in this direction"
3306,"""She's hiding in the basement along with Biden.""    

It's almost like her campaign has a well-formulated plan and knows what they're doing: Ride the early momentum via rallies, introduce herself to people that don't really know her well, poke and prod Trump via social media and let him put his foot in his mouth, prepare and dominate the debate, then get out there and talk more in the last 45 days to put a bow on an already incredibly smooth running campaign."
3307,She's met the moment every time so far.
3308,Now that we've seen 2024 Harris what I want is for her to keep talking as much as possible
3309,"See. There you go, media. The much wished for sit down interviews. Harris Walz campaign know what they’re doing."
3310,"""She is copying me again!!!"""

3312,I'm very much impressed by the way she's kept her powder dry right up until it's the right moment to load and fire.
3313,"People will criticize her for not doing interviews sooner, but I think every decision the campaign has made has been spot on. Now that she has introduced herself to the country via the debate and piqued their interest, ride that momentum to do more interviews and tell the interested voters more about yourself and policiesq"
3314,Send Kamala to Hot Ones and Walz to Rogan
3315,Harris on Theo Von incoming
3316,"Smartless for sure, I would think."
3317,Do the JRE if he's man enough.
3318,Nardwuar?
3319,I would honestly almost guarantee it.
3320,"She's such a foodie, stuff like that is a no-brainer for her"
3321,"God, that would be something else, especially if Kamala just waltzes through them like they're nothing."
3322,"I almost want her and Walz to do it together. I’m falling in love with that man, but the chance for some good natured ribbing on him would be entertaining

“Mdm Vice President, this is the titan killer 7000, and Gov Walz for you we have a rim of salt”

VP: Hmm, now that’s sweet with a kick!

Walz: by golly that’s done me in, where’s the ranch?!?"
3323,They don’t do politicians I think
3324,Oh that would be incredible!!
3325,"It’s the most obvious choice that it feels like it has to happen. Do it while early voting is happening in a lot of states and when he says, “this camera, this camera, and this camera tell the people what you have going on.” She can say she’s running for president and ask folks to vote tomorrow."
3326,Can't wait for Sean Evans to ask Kamala some deep dive question about a specific case from her time as San Francisco District Attorney.
3327,They would have to vet the hell out of the sauces.
3328,Oh shit yes
3329,"I’m going to need Maya Rudolph starting out the first half as Kamala and feigning loosing her cool, then have the real Kamala come in and handle the rest of the line up like its NBD."
3330,“So with the election coming up can you tell America about your views on Jason Tatum? What about Bezos buying the Celtics? What do you think the opening line for the Pats game will be? Aren’t the Lakers the worst? But first PEARL JAM and three of my college roommates will tell us what restaurant they ate at!”
3331,"She should go on Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend.

Even when he does serious interviews, like Barack and Michelle Obama, he’s still up there with the best interviewers and gets the most out of his guests."
3332,"I'd like to see her take the fight to the podcasts that Trump has been doing the rounds on. Lex Friedman and Theo Vonn come to mind. Rogan too, though I haven't paid enough attention to know if Trump's been on Rogan."
3333,the media has for the most part been cutting her down since she became VP.  now she's changed the dynamic so they have to do constructive interviews instead of trying to put her on the defensive the whole time.  good for her.
3334,So well said.
3335,The real question is can they manage to ask her anything that isn't about whatever stupid shit just came out of Trump's mouth that day.
3336,"Yep. Almost as though they had a plan and strategy all along, letting her establish herself first, seize momentum during the debate, and then move into media/interview mode. 

I think we're just so used to Trumpian insanity that a pretty standard professional campaign seems weird to us. Harris is a professional and she's surrounded herself with professionals. It might be boring next to the non stop lunacy of the Trump campaign, but politics is supposed to be boring."
3337,So infuriating how vocal they’ve been about it. They act like she owes the NYT a sit down despite their editorial writers destroying Biden’s campaign
3338,The pod bros have a much better relationship with Harris' team than Biden's team so I wouldn't be shocked if she made a quick appearance at some point before the election. They just had Doug Emhoff on last week
3339,"Amen. While our media was all ""But, but, but..."""
3340,"Rogan won’t do it, he’s gutless and only has people on from the right or democrat posers like Gabbard."
3341,"It would be phenomenal to have her on together with self-identified spice-avoidant Walz.

Great opportunity to demonstrate compassion and courage."
3342,Gordon Ramsey tried and surprisingly got overwhelmed quickly.
3343,"""There was no hot sauce!!! Look at her ear rings! It has bluetooth in it!!!"""
3344,They’ll do anything that gets them incredible ratings. Everyone has a price.
3345,Is that a rule or they just generally don’t?
3346,Needs to ask her her deep take on an 80s comedy movie as well.
3347,Biden did earlier this spring and he was great.
3348,This 100000% I don’t want to hear bitching from the media about not getting their ratings from her interview if they are just going to have her respond to that idiot over and over.
3349,I would watch the fuck out of that.
3350,"Alton Brown is one of the best episodes. Digs into the sauces. “It’s hot, but it’s not *good.*” Also, half-and-half to neutralize the heat."
3351,Michael Cera made those wings his bitch.
3352,With her mother being of Indian decent she probably could handle Da Bomb like it ain’t shit.
3353,Special milk-based earrings to nullify the heat.
3354,"During the 2020 election cycle Sean spoke about not having politicians on since it’s just going to make at least one group angry, so it better not to.

Even beyond that, I imagine the logistics and security complications of having a presidential candidate on would be incredibly difficult to manage."
3355,Loved him critiquing each sauce and how proud dude was when Alton told him his was great
3356,The palest dudes can take the most heat
3357,Their set isn’t complicated. I assume they’d just set it up wherever she is.
3358,See: Conan O’Brien.

3360,">Kelly exasperatedly read Swift’s endorsement post live on her podcast The Megyn Kelly Show on Tuesday evening, declaring that the pop star should prepare to “kiss your sales to the Republican audience goodbye.”


I have a sneaking suspicion that she'll be just fine. Is Kelly back to full time grifting for the right? I remember she tried to rehab her image for a minute."
3361,"Megyn also claimed VP Harris slept her way to the top.

When Megs was accused of boning Brit Hume to get ahead at Fox, she was aghast, of course.

MK a racist, homophobic garbage barge."
3362,"It’s OK for Trump to say who Taylor Swift endorses, but for Taylor Swift to say who Taylor Swift endorses is intolerable."
3363,">Kelly exasperatedly read Swift’s endorsement post live on her podcast The Megyn Kelly Show on Tuesday evening, declaring that the pop star should prepare to “kiss your sales to the Republican audience goodbye.”

Do you think her Republican fans thought she was a secret Trumper? She endorsed Biden in 2020. And people are flying to other countries to see her shows so I think her sales will be just fine.

>“I’m allowed to criticize Taylor Swift and I don’t give a s*** who gets upset,” Kelly said. “This is disgusting. If she wants to vote Harris-Walz, she can do it all she wants but to say the reason she’s doing it is because of Tim Walz’s stance on LGBT… F you, Taylor Swift.”

Again, were her existing views on LGBTQ+ issues unknown to her fans and the media?"
3364,"Well Megyn, you guys should get some boots on the ground and stop complaining. Have Kid Rock do a trailer park tour."
3365,"Republicans seemed quite happy with the AI of Swift endorsing Trump. Oh I see, reality is different from what they thought and they don't know how to process that."

3367,"> Kelly exasperatedly read Swift’s endorsement post live on her podcast The Megyn Kelly Show on Tuesday evening, declaring that the pop star should prepare to “kiss your sales to the Republican audience goodbye.”

She will take that as a W. 

> But the podcast host became irate when she read Swift’s one-line sentence commending Walz for “standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body.”

> “Oh my God,” Kelly said raising her hands to her temples before embarking on a tangent about gender-affirming medical care for minors.

> “So this woman is fine with his plan to take custody of the children from parents, who don’t want them to chop off their body parts, and put them in Minnesota court custody so the body parents can be chopped off and they can be sterilized outside the custody of their parents,” Kelly said.

That’s not what he did though or said. 

> Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order [on] Wednesday ensuring people who seek and receive gender-affirming care in the state have protection under the law.^[[1](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/03/08/walz-moves-to-protect-those-seeking-genderaffirming-care)]

Nobody here is talking about ISISesque actions. Are you okay? Should I be concerned about you?

3368,"I always laugh when these Right Wing loons threaten mega stars like Taylor Swift who are multimillionaires. They think that Republicans will not buy her music or go to her concerts because of her political views. First of all, almost every popular musician, actor, artist or creative celebrity are Democrats or lean to the left. If they boycott them, they will only be able to support washed up B-list hacks like Kid Rock and Ted Nugent. Tough luck MAGAs, all the cool kids are liberal."
3369,"Boo hoo!

Buncha snowflakes!

But hey, they still have Kid Rock, LOL!"
3370,Is this the same lady that melted down about black Santa
3371,"Hey republicans, don't be sad.  You have Kevin Sorbo."
3372,"Here’s the YouTube link (Megyn part is the first 3 minutes but the rest is good too) : https://youtu.be/ylDfei70h7I?si=LcDp2G2yOiIA8x1q 

She really does have a meltdown it’s not hyperbole.  She also seems to have a very creepy obsession tying everything to childrens’ genitals."
3373,"> “kiss your sales to the Republican audience goodbye.”

Did Megyn Kelly blackout in 2020, because Taylor endorsed Biden + Harris for that election. And something tells me she’s done just fine in sales since then."
3374,She's so desperate to stay relevant
3375,"The meltdown might be confusing for a lot of people..

Maga world thought (maybe hoped) they had bullied her into keeping quiet this cycle.. 

the collective losing of their mind about her dating a famous football player was calculated, they wanted to sic the cult members on her to show her just a taste of what this would be like.  I'm sure she got crazy death threats by the hundreds, but she persisted.. I'm glad she didn't let them win."
3376,Hey Megyn word to the wise do not piss off the Swifties they are FAR larger and WAY more dedicated than Trumpers... (seriously it's probably a good thing Taylor doesn't run for president she'd probably be unstoppable
3377,"Megan Kelly and Taylor swift don't belong in the same sentence. 

Taylor is a legit global super star and Megan is barely a third rate celerity on cable."
3378,"[*Megyn Kelly*](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/megyn-kelly)*, the political commentator and former Fox News anchor*

All I need to know, and good reason to not bother reading further."
3379,People are entitled to support whoever they want without this kind of reaction.
3380,Megyn is an all around terrible person. Like the personification of a soulless grifter
3381,Looks like Taylor Swift's influence is getting under some people’s skin.
3382,"My god I never knew trans surgery was so easy! Where are these children even getting the money for all this surgery without parental consent!

America your medical system truly is amazing providing all this free healthcare. You wouldn’t get this level of support in Australia! "
3383,"""And of course, Megyn Kelly. What would I do without Megyn Kelly? Probably be more proud of women."" - Michelle Wolf"
3384,"I mean, if I were a super successful, extremely popular artist, and someone would tell me ""You're gonna lose all your conservative/republican fans!!!"", my only response would be ""Good.""

If you lose your mind because I don't support a psychopathic fascist like Trump, then I don't want your money. 

Pretty sure TS is gonna be fine."
3385,I’ve never listened to Megyn Kelly talk before. Now I understand Firecracker from The Boys better
3386,"She is a terrible person. Ranted against “me too” until she was sexually harassed; disparaged maternity leave until she needed it; blasts hollywood actresses for facial improvements but practically od’s on botox, straight up insists that Jesus Christ and Santa were both white as snow.  Man she is fucking the worst."
3387,"""She had blood coming out of her... wherever"" "
3388,"Remember when the MSM tried rehabilitating that miserable racist? They gave her a shot on NBC. Miss ""Jesus was white, Santa was white!!"" Yeah, real good and genuine person."
3389,It’s okay for Megyn Kelly to use her platform to tell people who she endorses but Megyn Kelly doesn’t like it when Taylor uses her platform to tell people who she endorses.
3390,Republicans need to learn to shake it off
3391,"Uhh did anyone actually think there was a snowballs chance in hell that Taylor would endorse Trump/Vance??? After all that misogynistic shit they spew nonstop? 

I kinda feel sorry for magats at this point. They were so fucking happy with all those AI delusions of Swifties for Trump and now they got a nice cold splash from reality lmao."
3392,Donald Trump’s own actions directly led to her endorsing Kamala Harris.
3393,Megyn who?
3394,"“F you, Taylor Swift” - Megyn Kelly

Ok then.  Rain fire Swifties!!"
3395,Didn’t Trump once call her a b***h before? She still supports him?
3396,Megyn Kelly is bleeding out of her various holes here
3397,They really are weird.
3398,was megyn in blackface?
3399,What’s with the spelling of Megyn.
3400,She’s the new Ann Coulter. Just comes out for big events to spout some craziness and get some attention. She’s even kinda starting to look like her.
3401,"Kelly had a chance about 7 years ago to pivot...

Instead she doubled down on white-Santa."
3402,Who tf is a Meghan Kelley
3403,"#Megyn Kelly again bleeding out of her whatever…

In all seriousness, what a CUCK she is! 

Trump HUMILIATED this lady and she still simps for him.

Absolutely embarrassing!"
3404,"LOL, Megyn is such a garbage person."
3405,"The best way to combat Megyn, is to ignore her and make her one not to watch."
3406,"M. Kelly has gone full maga and thereby made herself an irrelevant extremist who feigns 
freak outs about matters that are better left to the individual.  Stat out of people’s private lives, Megyn - it’s none of your damn business"
3407,I watched her show one time and she was yelling at someone on her show that the dems want to take her children and make them trans. I was like it doesn’t work that way. She’s a little weird and nuts
3408,"Y’know, I get tired of “destroyed” this and “meltdown” that (thanks to right-wing whining mostly), so whenever I see something about anyone on any side “having a meltdown,” I take it with a grain of salt.  
  
With that in mind: goddamn, Megyn Kelly sure did have a big ol’ fucking fit, didn’t she? Making shit up and screaming, totally misunderstanding what Taylor Swift wrote, it all feels like she thought she’d stay out of this or endorse Trump or something.  
  
I sorta feel like having to watch Trump get fed his own ass at that debate and then immediately see Harris get Swift’s endorsement was too much for Kelly to handle. It’s dynamite."
3409,"Poor Megan, it must suck being a racist, moronic bitch"
3410,She's consistently awful
3411,Megyn Kelly looks like the type of girl who made fun of the fat kids in school - and never grew out of that meanness.
3412,I had no idea Kelly had become so unhinged as to believe the nonsense the was spreading
3413,"> Megyn Kelly ..

I’m sorry, who?"
3414,"So many times they yell some crazy thing they claim Democrats want to do and then say ""it's unbelievable."" Like, yeah Megyn, it is unbelievable. Almost like it's complete bullshit. Just like every other time you've been outraged by made-up nonsense."
3415,"If this is the hill she wants to die on, so be it. RIP Megyn."
3416,She is a horrible human being. Nothing decent about her at all. She creates rage bait for money and attention.
3417,"Irrelevant comments from an irrelevant former Fox News hack.  Nobody wants her anymore and she's just a podcaster.  She's desperately trying to get traction by saying something inflammatory about Tay Tay.

Keep disappearing MK.  You're just about gone."
3418,"""… F you, Taylor Swift.”

lol, I don't think that Taylor Swift even knows who you are lady."
3419,"The woman that thought having Alex Jones as the first guest on her new prime time news show, that lasted for about 3 seconds, has words about another woman’s decision."
3420,Who?
3421,"Ong … is Megyn Kelly still a thing? She’s such a has been who’s trying so hard to be relevant! Taylor Swift hater … that’s all. Even without republicans Taylor will continue to be a winner bc she’s a decent human being! Stop kissing DT behind, Kelly!"
3422,Why is trans gender such a big bullet point? Is it really happening that often? I would guess that more kids are killed in school due to guns and than have the operation
3423,"Remember when Donald Trump basically told Megyn Kelly she was on her period when she asked her a tough question back when she was a ""serious news journalists?""

Imagine after losing all of your prestige and relevance becasue you dared to ask this convicted rapist about his treatment of women and then having to spend the rest your life on internet radio stroking his.... ego.

The woman is in a hell of her own making."
3424,Is she surprised or something?  Megyn Kelly has really gone down the toilet to the bottom of the septic tank.
3425,So when MAGA people have trouble processing something is there a little spinning swastika in front of them?
3426,"See, weird. They are so fucking weird. "
3427,Fuck your feelings
3428,Who is megyn kelly
3429,MK NOT very relevant
3430,Megyn Kelly is still a thing?
3431,asking honestly: how can any woman support republicans?  Its mind boggling to me.
3432,Kelly’s just jealous that she sold her soul to the wrong team 👍🏽
3433,She’s still around?
3434,You light one bitch on fire and everybody freaks out!
3435,Who?
3436,Didn’t she fuck Britt Hume while he was married?
3437,Time to bring out the big guns. Get me Chachi.
3438,"It’s me, hi! I’m the problem, it’s me."
3439,Megan Kelly is jelly jelly
3440,She said “kiss your republican sales goodbye”. Sure sounds like that cancel culture they always screech about lmao.
3441,"She is a has-been who is desperately trying to stay relevant. It's funny that she got kicked out of her network for speaking against the misogyny there, and now she is the same POS.

Go away strange person."
3442,Megyn Kelly really went off the deep end. As did her career.
3443,They're just big mad at the perfect execution of it all. Such a devastating embarrassment followed by a massive uptick in voter registration that isn't swinging to DJT
3444,So I guess Megyn Kelly forgot about what Trump REALLY thinks of her.
3445,"She’s a billionaire.  

How’s Kidd Rock and Ted Nugent doing?"
3446,This is the same woman who got triggered by a Black Santa at one mall. Throw a pail of water on her and she’d melt
3447,"I wonder if Megyn Kelly ever met...  *Megyn Kelly*:

> Megyn Kelly said that she left Fox News because of President Donald Trump and the “snake pit” that is primetime cable news.

> Kelly added, “Bill O’Reilly, of all people, told me when I got to cable news primetime that cable news primetime is a snake pit. And that’s how it felt, and I didn’t want to be in the snake pit, I just wanted to cover the news.”

> --[Variety, September 21st, 2017](https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/megyn-kelly-why-leave-fox-news-trump-1202565511/)

Now, Megyn Kelly is the snake and the pit."
3448,"Trump said [very nice things](https://www.cnn.com/2015/08/08/politics/donald-trump-cnn-megyn-kelly-comment/index.html) about the then CNN host! /s

My god. These people really do sell their dignity…."
3449,"Wait, I thought cancel culture was a bad thing? Or? 

Having a hard time keeping up with what magats actually believe."
3450,"Denial  
Anger <- you are here  
Bargaining  
Depression  
Acceptance"
3451,"I love how half of the right wing pundits are like ""pah whatever, who cares what some billionaire performer thinks"" and the other half is like ""IM SO MAD ABOUT WHAT THIS BILLIONAIRE PERFORMER THINKS"""
3452,In my head I'm trying to create an imaginary person that cares what Megyn Kelly thinks and I'm sitting still with my eyes closed and I'm totally focused but I'm still failing miserably
3453,"It's funny how she's so mad.over something that isn't happening the way she says it is, but I'm 99% certain she's fine with circumcision which is what she's describing."
3454,January and February on my “People I Don’t Care About” calendar.
3455,Who?
3456,"In other words, “please take me back, FoxNews!!”"
3457,"Older ""blonde"" showing contempt for a younger more popular blonde.  It happens sometimes, just part of the circle of life."
3458,Megyn is such a piece of shit. I can't believe how far she has fallen.
3459,Is she still bleeding out of her wherever?
3460,Who?
3461,Who is Megyn Kelly?
3462,"“So this woman is fine with his plan to take custody of the children from parents, who don’t want them to chop off their body parts, and put them in Minnesota court custody so the body parents can be chopped off and they can be sterilized outside the custody of their parents,” Kelly said.

They are melting down before our eyes."
3463,"
Did she show half as much outrage when Trump exploited Taylor Swift by using that fake AI image that implied she supported him?  Has it occurred to Kelly that a good and effective leader should have championed Taylor Swift by promising to ban such exploitation?

Yeah, didn’t think so."
3464,She’s still angry about almost being somebody but somehow finding herself on the fringe…
3465,Remember when Jane Fonda ended her talk show career
3466,"I'll admit, I think that Swift's music is mostly mid, but I also can't deny that all of this maldening is hilarious as all Hell, so I'll take it"
3467,"wow, the last I heard of Megyn Kelly was when Trump was making fun of her for her period.  Is she back on the Trump train? What is it that GOB called tricks?"
3468,Who?
3469,"OMG. I stopped reading halfway through. Can’t decide who’s more delulu Trump or Kelly.  Both have equal amount of lies and misinformation that can fill the public library from top or bottom. 

Geez.  Get fired already."
3470,Wow the GOP is really worried about the power of Taylor recruiting new voters for Harris. Megyn is past her prime I think and is doing what she can to be significant
3471,Megyn Kelly makes JD Vance look like a feminist.
3472,"I don’t think swift really cares about sales to republicans 

Can’t imagine it’ll make a dent in her bank account."
3473,I'm sure TS is losing sleep over Kelly's comment about losing Republican sales.
3474,"Megyn, your OWN EMPLOYER abused you and you still defend the hard right?!!! Tf is wrong with conservative women and their broken brains."
3475,I wonder how many teenaged Swifties are getting their stuff thrown out by dad today?
3476,Megyn is a sell out. Donnie the Douche absolutely made her life miserable. What a self centered ego driven piece of trash she turned out to be.
3477,She’s mentally unstable
3478,They’re fighting for survival. Went all in with crazy and are discovering all the lifeboats are gone.
3479,Magat Kelly is a scab
3480,"lol @ Megyn trying to fearmonger with Taylor’s sales taking a hit. 

I’m sure she will be *just fine*."
3481,Who TF is Megyn Kelly?
3482,Swift is a billionaire. Of course Megyn is jealous as hell.
3483,"Isn't Megyn Kelly the basis for the blonde newcaster in ""Don't Look Up""?

You know, the character that is an absolute awful person that influences the main character to cheat on his spouse (easily done bc he sucks too) and later decides to use her last minutes alive to enjoy talking shit about people with her coworker instead of anything meaningful?

That terrible person?"
3484,She will Shake It Off.
3485,"The maga trash has really been looking tired, stale and stupid. Who are the people that support this filth?"
3486,She's already a billionaire. I really think she DGAF
3487,"Are you ok, Megyn? Jfc settle down"
3488,Kelly will be third row on her next tour. This is just performative outrage.
3489,Megyn Who?
3490,What is this child even saying? Body parts chopped off and sterilized? I should've been a hard right wing grifter. Way more lucrative than my current job.
3491,They just keep getting more weird and insane.
3492,We have one life to live. Imagine spending a large proportion of yours being this mad about something that isn’t true in service of a liar who cares nothing about you.
3493,“Megyn Kelly has a meltdown over [insert ridiculous culture war dogwhistle].” This is a very unserious person.
3494,She sold out 3 concerts in Sweden. And as much in all cities the tour is visiting. She does not give a F for republican voters 🙄
3495,"How old is Megan? 60?   
She sounds like one of those angry bitches in highschool that would pick on all the younger girls. She's losing relevance, so she's lashing out as a means to desperately clutch on to a sad string of vanishing nostalgia that she has for her early years. Pathetic to watch someone age so disgracefully."
3496,They can't talk about any liberal cause or position without first twisting it into something that didn't exist anywhere before they opened their mouth.
3497,Who?
3498,"Megyn Kelly is so upset about Taylor Swift endorsing Harris, she has blood coming out of everywhere."
3499,This woman was publicly humiliated by trump. What is wrong with her 
3500,"Someone should tell Kelly when you ostracize anyone who is not straight, married and white, it’s not a winning strategy"
3501,Accountability is coming for the maggots
3502,Remember how Trump literally insulted this woman out of a career now she has a YouTube show and woo is she angry about protecting rights she doesn’t agree with. She is absolutely cool with being insulted for being a woman and fine with then GOPs lies. But man did her hate and bigotry get triggered by Swift.
3503,"That lady has a meltdown over anything.  Any time any professional athlete or celebrity says something to support a Democrat she has a meltdown and tells them to shut up.  But if it’s someone supporting a republican, they’re so great! Just shut the f up already you’re a news anchor has been trying to get YouTube clicks, at least these athletes and celebrities are good at their craft."
3504,That trash compactor is still around grasping for relevance? I thought she was gone. 
3505,"Has Megyn had such a vitriolic response to any other celebrity endorsement of Kamala? Taylor has very publicly supported democrats for years now. I’m shocked that Megyn seems shocked. I get it, republicans wanted the support of the worlds biggest popstar, someone a bit more successful than their dopey ass kid rock and hulk hogan. But Taylor’s fans have known where she stands for years. If they were gonna kick rock over her politics, they would have by now. The reality is, either the fans don’t care or republicans just don’t have the economic and social capital to actually pull off “cancelling” arguably the most famous person in the world right now based off politics alone."
3506,She needs to calm down. She’s being too loud.
3507,The sheer idea of not selling out your moral convictions out of fear for retribution just doesn’t compute with hacks like her.
3508,Megyn Kelly who tried to help Alex Jones rehab his image? That one?
3509,"To be fair, there isn’t much she doesn’t have a melt down over because it’s the only way she can stay relevant. She can’t get a job at any media outlet after burning both conservative and regular media bridges. Every tweet, post, sound bite or media clip is a desperate audition for an audience of one: Trump."
3510,ANY REPUKE that will not listen to Taylor has already done so already so just  your trap shut Kelly
3511,"Man all these conservatives sure care about trans kids so much.


Its funny they give no fucks when they are in full mental anguish before they declare themselves as trans."
3512,"I can hardly wait for the song she’s gonna write telling Elon she’d nevah fu%$ him unless it’s to say FU%$ OFF. And her childless cat lady song should be amazing. 
My daughter, her birth mother and I are seeing her final concert of the Eras Tour in Vancouver in December. CANNOT WAIT."
3513,I have a meltdown anytime I have to listen to Megan Kelly.
3514,Amazing she ended the rant with “the left is losing its mind”
3515,"Was she bleeding out of her whatever about it?


She can fuck off with all the others that sell their soul to this piece of shit "
3516,MAGA meltdowns are multiplying like rabbits on Viagra.
3517,"Kelly bitching about ""age of consent"" when she's happy to force a child to carry their rape baby is filthy fucking rich.

F you, Megyn Kelly."
3518,"Mrs. ""White Santa"" thinks she is relevant."
3519,Who's Megyn Kelly?
3520,Mrs. Waterford is really upset.
3521,Who is Megan Kelly?
3522,"You know why she did that, right?

*She's a closet Swiftie.*"
3523,"Republicans: we’re tired of getting cancelled for simply expressing our opinions.

Taylor Swift: After doing lots of personal research, and acknowledging that Trump used fake AI image of me endorsing him, I’m gonna vote for Harris because I believe she fights for the rights I believe. However, this is my decision and you may chose differently after your own research.

Republicans: **cancel her!!!!!**"
3524,"Always projection, ‘The left is losing its mind.’"
3525,"If I had a dollar for every time a prominent right-winger melted down over something, I might be as rich as Taylor."
3526,I absolutely love the irony of how the woman screaming about mythical transgender surgeries being performed on minors will say - in the same breath - that “the left is losing their minds.”
3527,"If you are ever in a position to hear Megyn Kelly’s voice, you are living your life wrong."
3528,"She was mad at the moderators for fact checking Trump. I immediately thought of her, as a moderator, instantly fact checking Trump’s famous “only Rosie O’Donnell” line in a 2016 GOP debate."
3529,">kiss your sales to a Republican audience goodbye

… is this the cancel culture the GOP keep harping on about?"
3530,I love how they never had this concern for any of the maga celebrities.  Like they know they don't have any other audience
3531,Swift endorsed Biden in 2020 and then went on a tour that made a billion dollars.  She’s going to be fine.
3532,"When Tim Walz recounted this, he said “Megyn had blood coming out of her wherever” and gesticulated crudely. Wait, no, that wasn’t Tim Walz, that was the man Kelly is vehemently boosting, the [golden cad](https://images.app.goo.gl/WvmCtpbLQqxK1PmMA) himself, Donald Trump."
3533,"> Is Kelly back to full time grifting for the right?

Yeah. She's back to throwing black face parties again."
3534,"hey the (formerly Dixie) Chicks are still banking and touring two decades after being cancelled by the right, so can Taylor Swift."
3535,She already endorsed Biden in 2020 and it had absolutely zero effect on her audience size.  Why is Megyn Kelly so dumb?
3536,"If every person on earth decided to stop buying Taylor Swift products today, her and her descendants will still be set for probably centuries. 

She literally has “fuck you” money."
3537,"Yeah her attempt at centrism was an abject failure because after decades of repeating Fox's lies she was persona non grata in the rest of the news industry, and she didn't bring any viewers with her when she left Fox. 

So she had neither professional integrity nor a strong audience so she lasted all of 5 minutes before she started a podcast and, surprise, is back to repeating right wing BS because that's what gets her clicks."
3538,"Taylor is a BILLIONAIRE.  She believes in a cause 
and believes it rises above her Republican audience. God bless her. She has integrity and knows her voice makes a difference. Losing some sells has little to no meaning to her."
3539,"Republicans obviously don't listen to the lyrics... She didn't need to officially endorse Harris, her lyrics and lifestyle are an obvious indicator who she's voting for... And she made Biden cookies before."
3540,Oh no how will she get by?
3541,"She tried to make a go of it in not political shit stirring and signed with ABC News. She fucked it up so bad so fast that they ended her contract after just a year. 

Lost a $20m a year contact almost as soon as she'd signed it. And ended up on SiriusXM.

No one was interested in her besides the right. And she couldn't keep her shit together in polite company. Softball interview of Putin was her big debut, and she finished it off with a defense of blackface."
3542,"Oh yeah, a hot minute with one of the og 3 networks, but she wasted no time at all going hard right again and was promptly let go lol"
3543,"Seriously, I'm sure the billionaire pop star is worried about losing her Republican audience lmao."
3544,"Sorry, her fans aren’t all 90."
3545,She’s such a hack. She’s as much of a hack as Southern Dandy and Closeted Gay Man Lindsay Graham.
3546,She always goes back to them
3547,"Too bad album sales aren’t made by an electoral college.   Even if every republican stopped buying her music, it still wouldn’t be the majority of Americans."
3548,She made a run at the middle and it failed because her middle was on the right.
3549,"She’s supported democratic candidates for a while now, plus has been pro lgbtq community pretty vocally. Anyone who doesn’t like her politics has had a long time to drop off."
3550,Not sure Megyn Kelly should be giving career advice to anyone.
3551,"I thought she went away into obscurity, first time I’ve heard her mentioned in years"
3552,"Republicans are used to dealing with Donald Trump, who is so bad at business that he is constantly begging for money.  I don't think they realize that Taylor Swift can live comfortably forever even if she never sells another album or seat ticket for the rest of her life, because she's not constantly going around self sabotaging and running scam universities and constantly getting sued for fraud."
3553,I believe it was Kelly the republican loons turned on when she dared to ask trump to clarify what he said about Rosie.  All she did was quote what trump said and asked him what he meant by it.  She also suspects someone at Fox poisoned her the night of the debate she moderated.  She had a puke bucket hidden in her podium.   What does it take for someone to turn away from the cult?
3554,"She endorsed Biden in 2020.  

Taylor is doing fine."
3555,"Sounds like Swift would rather have principles, the United States, and $1.5 billion than $2 billion."
3556,I'm sure she will just shake it off
3557,"Yeah I don’t think her millions of fans in Asia care about the endorsement. If anything, they’ll love her even more given how much Trump is disliked around the world."
3558,"Who is Megyn Kelly?

Why are the peddlers of maga disinfotainment melting? Is it because their 'alpha male' was thoroughly exposed for his vacuousness for the entire world to see?"
3559,How the hell do these people think one can sleep their way into progressively higher elected positions? Are we supposed to believe that she slept with half the voters in California?
3560,"Amen. The number of women and minorities that try to rise to power in the conservative grift machine will always astound me. Wake TF up. You are supporting a movement that either thinks you are a second class citizen, in the case of women, or inferior due to not being white.

Fuck Kelly and all the others who sold their souls to the MAGAts."
3561,"Megyn Kelly is literally the most unhinged psychopath ~~Margot Robbie~~ Charlize Theron has ever played.

(I misremembered but fortunately the joke still works.)"
3562,"Of course Megyn thinks that Kamala slept her way to the top, because a thief thinks that everybody steals."
3563,"It’s surprisingly worse.

Remember that she left Fox partially because of Trump but the main reason was from alleged sexual harassment. She then had a show on NBC until 2018 and was canceled apparently over discussions of blackface. 

This all gives the feelings of “it only matters if it happens to Megyn” and “it’s not misogyny or racism if she does it”

Gross."
3564,Ew. Brit Hume at the kind of clout?
3565,That crowd isn’t too big on women’s right to choose
3566,"It's also ok for other celebrities (Hulk Hogan, Elon Musk, etc) to endorse Trump. But Taylor Swift endorsing Harris is unacceptable."
3567,">“I’m allowed to criticize Taylor Swift and I don’t give a s*** who gets upset,”

But she's not allowed to criticize Trump."
3568,Kelly is such a miserable hag… she couldn’t hack it on the mainstream press tour and had to resort to destroying other women who are prettier and more talented than her so she could feel relevant again.
3569,">“I’m allowed to criticize Taylor Swift and I don’t give a s*** who gets upset,” Kelly said.

[Okay then, that was always allowed!](http://i.giphy.com/Qp45SP1P3PbbO.gif)"
3570,"She literally wrote a song all about it, ""You Need to Calm Down"""
3571,">""F you, Taylor Swift.""

Far-rights ""pundits"" love to criticize the supposed lack of civility from Democrats, then the'yll say things like that."
3572,Yeah a person I know who has voted for Trump at every chance so far just post about how Taylor is the queen because of all the VMAs she won tonight. She’ll be fine.
3573,"‘No amount of shade is gonna make anybody less gay.’

Pretty sure her stance on lbgt is pretty clear. 

But these are the same people who think Twisted Sister and Rage Against the Machine used to be conservatives."
3574,Maybe Ted Nugent can do a duet with the mypillow guy
3575,"Scott Baio can do a U.S. tour for old white men ""Back To The Happy Days With Donald and Project 2025"""
3576,"This is what I don't understand. The right fawns over kid rock and ted nugent supporting trump. 

Tay Tay comes out for harris and it's a nuclear meltdown.

Like, sorry conservatives that your celebs are fucking weird and washed up, lmao."
3577,"Well I don't care if you're just thirteen  
You look too good to be true  
I just know that you're probably clean  
There's one lil' thing I got do to you  
   
Guaranteed Republican hit"
3578,Republicans are so bankrupt of good faith that even a Fred Durst turns them down!
3579,Kid Rock and Ted Nugent will have a charity concert for their idol Trump.
3580,"I doubt Kid rock has set foot in a trailer park since at least the mid 90s.

There are poor people in those places.

Ryan George just released a [sketch video that sums it up perfectly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hASr5vdMYkA).

Edit; Well, shows how much I care about Kid Rock. Never knew he was a rich brat, just that he peaked at least 20 years ago."
3581,Quick. Someone teach Lee Greenwood how to twerk!!
3582,He and Ted Nugenr likely have warrants out in several swing states for non payment of child support. Makes touring dicey.
3583,Kid rock has no idea how to find a trailer park.  He was a rich kid.
3584,No one in Trump’s circles (except possibly Trump himself) thought the AI endorsement was real. They just thought they’d successfully cowed Taylor into silence. Now they’re angry she’s proven them wrong.
3585,"If you look at the clip, goodness sake they are not exaggerating when they say she had a meltdown, shit just starts spewing out of her mouth, how can people tolerate this kind of stuff."
3586,"Santa being white makes sense because Sinterklaus. He’s literally a Germanic story. (But really, who cares? If Chinatown has a Chinese Santa Claus, is that worth getting upset? Of course not. Particularly since the “jolly fat guy” imagery we’re all familiar with comes from Coca-Cola. It’s not the historical myth version any damned way.)

But Jesus being white does not because he’s a Jewish dude from the Middle East. Tell Megyn that and she’d probably go rabid, with blood coming out of her wherever."
3587,"I’m so just tired of the lies. If your policy positions are so good, why do you have to outright lie about what democrats are doing? Immigrants are not pouring into the country from insane asylums. Nobody is eating your pets. There are no post birth abortions. Schools are not performing transgender surgeries. No one is kidnapping your son and returning him as your daughter. When people talk about gender affirming care for children, they’re talking about puberty blockers, not surgery, and no one is being forced to give them to their children. Maybe if you bothered to actually educate yourselves you wouldn’t be so outraged all the time. 

And Imane Khelif is a woman, you fucking doorknobs. "
3588,"Every accusation is a confession  It's projection, probably taken from the Texas GOP trying to get state protective services to investigate parents of trans teens."
3589,"Funny how they are complaining about ""chopping off body parts"" of children in a country where circumsision is still bafflingly common"
3590,"Swify is a billionaire, just FYI."
3591,"> support washed up B-list hacks

I mean, these are the same people who are excited by a washed up B-list celebrity who can't even handle a middle aged woman pressing.him. They're literally voting for a punchline from 1987."
3592,"So are most scientists, scholars, engineers, teachers... Actually just about any intelligent person."
3593,yes.
3594,Of course it is. Conservatives are all fucking crybabies who get off on the fake persecution that they pander to their idiot base.
3595,"And Chachi 

Don't sleep on Chachi"
3596,"Quick, Hulk Hogan rip off your shirt again!"
3597,"Haha, the guy anyone knows anything about because they had to google “who the fuck is Kevin sorbo”"
3598,"“Why are you mad, when you could be GLAAD?” - Taylor 

I’m gonna have to try really hard to not troll MAGAs I know with Taylor Swift lyrics. Or, what the hell, maybe I will anyway, because they sure think it’s okay to smash everyone over the head with their opinions."
3599,this dudes framing is so fuckin perfect
3600,wut u mean the “eras” tour!??!  i heard it was a huge flop. nobody went. and those like 4 or 5 albums she put out?? i heard nobody bought them. got no radioplay. so she had to go lay low in europe this summer to deal with the shame of being such a failure.
3601,"It’s so wild considering NBC paid her millions to just go away and instead of living a normal human life with tons of money, she went full on with the grift. Lady is LOADED with cash and she can’t help but spend her time on Twitter. It’s sad and embarrassing."
3602,"A couple weeks ago I saw she randomly started referring to CNN’s Kaitlan Collins as a “cold-hearted bitch”.  I looked to see if or what Collins did to set her off, and it was literally nothing, Megyn just for some reason just wanted to let people know she didn’t like her overall."
3603,Jelous of her good looks and influence.
3604,"Don't forget the AI porn pictures of her that chuds on twitter were posting last year, as part of their ""Taylor Swift is ruining football"" tantrum.

They have a playbook of smearing, threatening and invading the privacy of anyone who stands against Trump, and clearly thought a mere woman wouldn't stand up to their bullying."
3605,Not to mention truly international.
3606,No joke. Piss them off and trump's campaign offices will never have another phone call get through again.
3607,"Celerity....lol  useless stalk of vegetable matter with practically no taste or nutritional value, but handy for cleaning your colon.  So many celerities out there!"
3608,Didn't trump say that schools are providing these sex changes? For free apparently! 😆
3609,"One hilarious thing about the right-wing and Trump's rant yesterday is that they're obviously just mashing together fearmonger topics like they're madlibs:

Illegal aliens in U.S. prisons are getting free transgender surgery. LOL."
3610,That’s a bingo!
3611,"I think it's a mix of some people GENUINELY forgetting or not knowing she endorsed Biden/Harris in 2020, some folks CONVINCED it's all some psyop 4d chess thing and she was secretly wink-wink, one of theirs, and some folks truly hoping she'd been ""taught a lesson"" about staying in her lane with the violence spawned from the attack in the UK that was linked to her music, and the credible terrorist threats against her concerts that resulted in cancelation in Austria.


As a realist: there are probably also some folks who HOPE she's changed her mind."
3612,I think she only does that on the weekends now.
3613,It’s a tragedeigh.
3614,In my head I always want to pronounce it like gyn-ecologist
3615,"As she famously said, “remember kids, Santa just IS white.” 

She’s a flaming racist, always has been."
3616,"I'll do you one better, why is Megyn Kelly."
3617,Do they not realize she endorsed Biden in 2020?
3618,"Megun... Megan... Meagan...
Ah sorry, no idea"
3619,Some screaming witch I think.
3620,"She literally endorsed biden/harris 2020, so any republicans that would have stopped giving her money already did.  She seems to be doing ok financially anyway.  I think she'll live."
3621,"They also cancelled bud light, the NBA, MLB and NFL."
3622,No where in the statement did Swift insult Republicans or Trump.  Megyn Kelly has lost the plot trying to chase her audience to the fringe right.
3623,Fuck it... I'm a 49 year old dude. I will start buying Swift merch to offset
3624,"Pffft, jokes on them, Taylor Swift probably doesn’t give a flying fuck if republicans stop buying her music or her merch or whatever.  She probably also doesn’t want hardcore right wingers or Trump fans to be part of her audience.

Her sold out world tour speaks for itself, and she sure as hell won’t lose many if any fans or followers because of her Kamala endorsement."
3625,"Ask the NFL, Disney, NBA, MLB, Bud Light, books, etc etc etc.

That’s all these morons do is cancel anything they disagree with."
3626,"are toothless hillbillies and the geriatric crowd buying Swift items anyway? Seems Morgan Whalen, Jason Aldean, Lee Greenwood, and Pat Boone have the right tied up"
3627,They do realize she endorsed Biden in 2020?
3628,Somehow I don’t think that setting up Taylor Swift as the battleground for the next GOP culture war is going to work out in their favour.
3629,Yeah except they’ll buy a bunch of her shit and then burn it.
3630,"I’m going to try to keep my thoughts at a minimum.

However it’s such a small minded and nationalist viewpoint to believe that “cancelling” something works.

Taylor Swift is a worldwide pop star. A few conservatives aren’t going to impact sales.

But the failed attempts to impact global companies and calling for boycotts of companies like Apple are just insane. It’s really telling that they don’t understand there is a world outside of their house."
3631,She endorsed Biden-Harris in ‘20. She’ll be just fine.
3632,"Yes. It's always been the Right who actually cancel shit. What do you think ""Go woke, go broke"" even means? It's that. It's the Right cancelling anything they don't like, the second they don't like it. Biggest bunch of crybaby snowflakes on the fucking planet."
3633,"The people who love to claim that LGBTQ people make that their whole personality, and who claim to hate identity politics sure seem to love making their political affiliation their entire personality.

Are Republicans really not able to even enjoy a song because the singer has a different political lean from them?"
3634,I’m pretty sure she’ll shake it off.
3635,I'm sure they're really hoping that Rob Schneider endorsement moves the needle.
3636,I'm anxiously awaiting Chachi's new sitcom....
3637,">I love how they never had this concern for any of the maga celebrities.

What are you going to do? Ruin Kevin sorbos career? Ruin Ted Nugent or kid rocks album sales? Ruin hulk Hogan's reputation?"
3638,"If anything, this should be turned back around on Megyn Kelly: “kiss your sales to the Swiftie audience goodbye.”"
3639,"I might be crazy, but it doesn't seem like the most dignified act to continue to bolster someone who has insulted you on the world stage. Especially in the manner that he chose to do so. 

But in her defense, she tried to go mainstream and couldn't get it to fly. The rightwing grift is all she has. 

But damn, how can she look at herself in the mirror knowing her job is to elevate the same guy who made a joke about her menstrual cycle to the same people you are producing content for today?"
3640,Except that the republicans wear pads on their ears.
3641,"They are, and I'm really glad they staged a comeback.  But they were really frozen out of the industry for a while after that incident."
3642,She's paid to be dumb. The right-wing doesn't believe in intelligent women.
3643,"Yup, the right can't grasp how much sway Swift has within pop culture. She could release a subscription-based podcast of her reading the dictionary and it'd be the most downloaded podcast with people waiting for her to get to their favorite words.

She's so far beyond needing to cater to the GOP."
3644,"It's unfortunate, because she's really smart and articulate, and a very good interviewer when she wants to be. She didn't always parrot Fox's propaganda. She challenged Trump more than any other debate moderator, and even if she was putting on a show, it was bold and praiseworthy. She was one of the more reasonable voices on Fox News (notwithstanding the whole ""Jesus and Santa are white"" stupidity). She and Shep Smith were the last vestiges of centrist and even liberal voices on that network. Then she was replaced by Tucker Carlson, and Fox is where it is today. 

I've listened to a couple of Kelly's YouTube videos lately. She's insufferable. Instead of discussing substantive issues (which she is more than capable of), she's leaned hard into the ""culture war"" stuff, with a new moral panic every week. She shills for a Christian for-profit college that seems to be her only sponsor. She has Charlie Kirk and Ben Shapiro on every other day. 

No thanks."
3645,"> So she had neither professional integrity nor a strong audience so she lasted all of 5 minutes before she started a podcast and, surprise, is back to repeating right wing BS because that's what gets her clicks.


I saw her doing the right wing podcast circuit recently and was confused but makes sense now."
3646,"I am not a Swift fan necessarily, but, she also is a fellow Millennial making it happen who appears to have a good sense of responsibility for her role and position of respect in the hearts of millions of women. I don't like billionaires, but those qualities are so rare I can't help but cheer for her."
3647,"You have to remember, these are the *same* people who claimed that Rage Against the Machine *suddenly* went **WOKE**. Yeah... not the sharpest tools in the shed."
3648,"The same way they got ahead in their careers. They work in garbage companies run by garbage men so that's what they had to do, and they think that's how everyone does it."
3649,It's yet another confession disguised as an accusation.
3650,"JD Vance did it. Got his billionaire to introduce him to Trump, Trump was told to endorse him, he did and JD Vance ran on that endorsement alone in Ohio. He got elected. Now he's VP candidate."
3651,"Obviously she didn’t, but if she had I’d be impressed. That’s some damn fine time management"
3652,I would be willing to do a reasonably good impersonation of a voter in California if any other smart attractive women want to follow in her footsteps !
3653,It’s projection. Megyn gobbled a lot of cock so she just assumes that VP Harris did as well.
3654,"Goddamn it, how do I get on a list to be slept with by the people running in my area?? I never knew this was an option, here I've been, giving them my votes for free!"
3655,Spending time around people like Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly
3656,"I mean, even if she had to jerk off everyone in California, that's like what, 2 guys a minute? "
3657,Can confirm. Trump has caught us.
3658,"It’s how Kelly got ahead, so she thinks all women get ahead that way."
3659,"Technically not an elected position, but Melania slept her way to being First Lady."
3660,"Charlize Theron*

Joke still works though"
3661,"Some of them want to repeal the 19th(?) amendment and I am amazed they haven’t been run out of town, tarred and feathered."
3662,"Her career would immediately come to an end if she did that, as the only people listening to her are MAGAts."
3663,I heard Hulk Hogan can sing!
3664,I’d rather it was a dual to the end.
3665,Back to the Happy Days with Donald in Charge.
3666,"If Chachi hits the campaign trail, so will Fonzie. Guess who is 1000x cooler."
3667,"Baio doesn't get to claim Happy Days, as we liberals have Ron Howard and Henry ""Fonzie"" Winkler."
3668,"Over in the conservative sub they’re all saying we shouldn’t care what a celebrity endorses. Meanwhile, like you said, fawning over their own celebrity endorsements. Hypocrisy in all things is the conservative motto. I just think they’re jealous that their celebrity endorsements are less popular, and/or this endorsement comes from an independent woman who made billions on her own talent."
3669,"Even better, they say why should an entertainer get political/ anyone care what an entertainer does, but when it's for their side, they use it constantly. So which is it??"
3670,I’m pretty sure the only time kid rock was in a trailer park was for a photo op.  He grew up in a mansion.
3671,Ever.  His dad owned a chain of car dealerships.
3672,Kid Rock grew up in a mansion outside of Detroit.  He's never seen a trailer park closer than 1/2 mile away.
3673,"The real issue is by postin the fake crap, Trump forced Taylor to respond. Had he never gotten involved, Taylor might not have drowned him with her millions and millions of fans."
3674,">They just thought they’d successfully cowed Taylor into silence.

By releasing an AI video of her?

I mean, I know they're not the brightest group, but come on."
3675,But Saint Nicholas was born in what is now Turkey. He wasn’t Germanic white.
3676,"Also, Santa isn't real. So he isn't white, or black, or anything... yet he can be anything we imagine him to be, even a she."
3677,Without straw men they have no argument.  Reality is not a winning strategy for them…. Not since the 1960s
3678,"They could just push real conservative policies. Those existed long before the Trump era. Would they be any good in our modern times? I highly doubt it, but that’s not even my point. At least they would have something to debate on a factual level.

They don’t want that. They have made lies, straw men, and a cult of personality their political trademarks, and now they have to live with it unless they want at least 30% of their voters to walk away."
3679,Technically a billion is just multiple millions added up. He’s technically correct! The best kind of correct.
3680,"plus Rob Schneider, Kid Rock, Hulk Hogan, Rosanne Barr, Ted Nugent...

It's VH1's new season The Surreal Life. This season instead of living together they just have to openly support Donald Trump and say racist things on twitter."
3681,"Wow, the schools have that much funding? What a country! "
3682,r/tragedeigh
3683,"Pretty certain that she has ""fuck-you-money"" about 1000x over."
3684,"This is the thing... why is this remotely a surprise to anyone?  All you have to do is look up who she's endorsed in the past, to make an educated guess about who she would be behind now.

I really think the only choices here were between Swift endorsing Harris, or Swift keeping silent. (I read something about terrorist threats made against some of her concerts, I think? And that she might be concerned that being more overtly political could bring harm to her fans, in the literal sense of an attack on one of the concerts. That's a concern I can understand. I guess her tour is over now, though?)"
3685,Which all seem to be doing just fine.
3686,"Don't forget Disney! That once glorious magical kingdom is nothing but a shell of it's former self. Sad, really."
3687,"Good point. What exactly is so apocalyptically threatening to the maggots here? That Taylor Swift encourages people to investigate the truth about the politician's positions? That she encourages people to make sure they are registered to vote?

And what is it that Megan Kelley approves about the right wing's reaction? That Elon Musk implies he's going to rape Taylor Swift?

That he's likely to have three superbowl rings embossed across his broken cheekbones if he gets within 100 feet of her?"
3688,"I also appreciated that Swift encouraged her fans to do the research, as she had done, and vote for the candidate they think will champion the issues important to them.  This was not a ""you need to vote for Kamala"" endorsement but a thoughtful explanation as to her choice, why she made it and why she felt she needed to go public with that choice.  Her sign off as a cat lady was a very nice touch."
3689,"Right? She didn't even tell her fans to vote for Kamala and Tim. She said she was and they should make up their own minds on who to vote for.

Just more proof that the MAGAs like Kelly hate democracy and America."
3690,"62 year old dude here. I hadn’t liked many TS songs, but was surprised how much I liked Clean. Still my fave of hers. Would proudly wear the T shirt."
3691,Dog dads for swift!
3692,"Same, my daughter already loves Taylor, I’ll just buy her a bunch of shit"
3693,Make sure you buy Taylor's Versions
3694,Im a 48 year old male w/ no kids and my wife and I are both swifties - the eras tour was the best concert of the year!  Though I still enjoyed blink 182 live too ;)
3695,She’ll be fine regardless.  Use your hard earned money on more noble things!
3696,Everyone in my Republican family is getting a Taylor Swift CD this year.
3697,"You really think she needs the money?

Donate to a senate or house race if you want to support democratic politics instead of celebrity worship."
3698,I'm 62...I'll help!
3699,I woke up and started jamming to Taylor
3700,She really doesn’t need the money
3701,59 yo female and I just listened to my first ever Swift song today. It was pretty good!
3702,"I’m in my seventies I’m with ya on that.  I’ve been giving Taylor swift stuff to my granddaughters, because my daughter in law is far far right."
3703,I’m 41 and a dude. Some of her songs are amazing. Shake it off will never fail to put me in a happy mood
3704,"Almost 40 years old, but I bought some Swift merch last night. Guess we're Swifties now."
3705,Dad bod in swiftie gear is so fire.
3706,"Pffft, Republican fathers will stop buying their daughters Taylor Swift music the day they stop paying for abortions for their mistresses."
3707,Yeti & fucking keurig
3708,"Cancel culturs to me was just the right of anyone to not listen to someone if they don't want to. 


And really what this means is far-right politics isn't really economically viable for good business."
3709,"Oh I don't know. Look at what the MAGA boycott has done to the NFL:

Be very afraid of the MAGA cancel power Taylor! :P"
3710,Cha-ching goes the cash register!
3711,This November Rob Schneider is... irrelevant
3712,*you can do it!*
3713,"Absolutely agree. Moreover, as one of Roger Ailes’ sexual harassment victims, it’s disgraceful that she has chosen the side of the predators."
3714,These people have no morals. They are traitors.
3715,"Her first act after that was to suckle Trump for an interview, and then she ended up basically apologizing to *him*."
3716,"Fortunately, times have changed.

More people are fully aware that Republicans tend to be horrible and/or cultish people, so there's no need to care about their weird complaints about the world changing without them."
3717,Don't give her ideas..?
3718,What day is “kitten”? Need to start planning the party.
3719,*subscribe*
3720,"She is obviously a very smart person, but she sold her soul to the ghouls at Fox so I'm not terribly sad that she's currently smack in the middle of ""Find Out"""
3721,It’s great you have that insight. I’m a boomer and our generation is done leading. It’s your turn. Good luck!
3722,That still makes me laugh every time I think about it. These people are soooo bad at any sort of critical analysis..
3723,"Sure, that makes perfect sense coming from their perspective. But there's no one you can sleep with in order to get tens of millions of votes for US Senator.

It's ridiculous on its face."
3724,I’m sure gay people would be fine if a JD meme went out how he slept his way to the top with his donor.  It would be the funniest tweet hung to see how the MAGAs react.  They don’t like the guy anyway.
3725,"Wilt Chamberlain's got nuthin on her, man!"
3726,"You're Australian, the accent alone would be enough."
3727,"He did one rap album, and it's in the most spoken word concept of rap."
3728,Only if both can lose
3729,duel
3730,"Of our dogs, and our cats"
3731,I actually met Henry Winkler years ago during my hotel days. Absolutely a gem of a human. And a great tipper.
3732,I'm going with the one that jumped a shark
3733,"No, I think she still would have. She got political in 2018 and hasn't looked back. But the AI thing clearly pissed her off (especially after there were those AI porn pictures of her circulating on twitter last year) and if there's one thing we should all know about Taylor Swift, it's that she keeps receipts."
3734,"Nah. I honestly think she was planning to endorse after the debate this whole time and the AI just threw a wrench in it. But rather than adjust her plan, she just went ""fuck it, I'll wait.""

The smart move, in my opinion. Releasing her endorsement as a reaction to the AI would have had less oomph."
3735,She absolutely still would have.
3736,"That's kinda it tho, they're not very bright lol"
3737,Taylor had said she was concerned about the safety of her fans from MAGA. When she didn’t endorse Kamala immediately after the AI nonsense they thought they wouldn’t hear further from her.
3738,But he lives in the North Pole. Polar bears live in the North Pole. Polar bears are white. Santa is a polar bear
3739,"Not only funding to do sexual reassignment surgery to your kids, without your knowledge, but they can ban thousands of books in the school library AND put litter boxes in bathrooms for those children that identify as cats. OTOH, only the bad schools run by Marxists in Minnesota feed all the children breakfast and lunch or provide socialist programs like head start.

Schools are in the forefront of destroying this country, thanks to liberals like Walz                           S/"
3740,I'm pretty sure fuck-you-money sits around thinking about all the wild shit it could get away with if it had taylor-swift-money.
3741,She doesn't have to worry about Taylor Swift cancelling her since Taylor Swift never would ever think about her.
3742,The girl that trolls/games the Billboard charts for shits and giggles is surely terrified of that threat...
3743,"She could never earn another cent, and still afford to live a life more luxurious than any of us could even imagine. 

She could never sell another ticket to any conservative/Trump supporter here or abroad, and still sell out every concert with legions of fans still left on the waiting list. 

Any republican cancel culture will not have any impact on her."
3744,She gave her tour's road crew a bonus of $55m.  I think she has cash to spare.
3745,"Also, Trump shared fake images of her endorsing him. You're pretty much forcing her endorsement at that point, removing the opportunity for her to stay silent."
3746,"> make an educated guess


Yes, but you're talking about the MAGA crowd."
3747,"Euro leg of the tour is done, she has more US and Canadian dates this fall."
3748,"They did make Bud Light blink, though. Which was annoying."
3749,"Nah man, didn’t you hear “gO wOkE gO bRoKe” or something."
3750,Bud light is fine but it did drop to 3rd most popular beer behind Michelob Ultra and Modelo. It had been #1 for quite some time.
3751,"No no no, you don't understand! The boycott ruined them and now they will never financially recover and the true patriots won and also Trump won the debate bigly and the all the cat stuff is super true and the deep state is just covering it up! Get a brain sheeple!"
3752,I heard the BLMAntifa burned it to the ground. The fires are still raging.
3753,"I think Kelley might be offended by this excerpt from Swift's post:

*""As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.""*

That's insulting to Mr. ""I have a concept of a plan"" Trump. Taylor Swift is encouraging voters to go out and read on the plans of each candidate. That's wildly unfair to the Republicans who still don't have a plan to replace the current healthcare system."
3754,Kelly appears to be very against surgeries for transgender youth (something VERY rare and only done in extreme cases). It seems she was upset by Walz's support for gender affirming care.
3755,"She’s the same simp who was misogynistically trashed by Trump, then sucked up to get an interview in which she apologized to *him*."
3756,"If you haven’t seen it: Stevie Nicks doubled down on Swift’s message, signed “Childless Dog Lady”

 https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/stevie-nicks-taylor-swifts-kamala-walz-endorsement-childless-dog-lady-1235099962/"
3757,"Plus, as she stated, she kind of had to since Trump posted AI falsely suggesting she endorsed him. She either had to let him misrepresent her or else come forward to correct him. Being silent and private was not an option."
3758,"I mea., she said cgo do you own research. Watch the debate I just watched"" when the debate did a really good job of showing a presidential Kamala vs Evil Grandpa.

I mean, I love that she did that, but let's not pretend it wasn't a mastermind move."
3759,"My teenager had no interest at all in Taylor Swift. Then they went on a week long camping trip, and the driver blasted TS nonstop. My kid came back home, explained how relentless it was, then said “anyway, guess I’m a Swiftie now. That stuff’s addictive.”"
3760,"Clean is a banger.  “10 months sober, I must admit:  Just because you’re clean, don’t mean you don’t miss it.”"
3761,"Mid forties Dad here. I'm not a huge fan of Taylor Swift, but I am a middling fan. Like, I tried to get tickets for myself when they went on sale, but I didn't try very hard. 

https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mHOONmW7kSUOYZeXHYBakzyhyAdSmThSc&si=imFuJcpJ3dxedKWz

I very strongly recommend Evermore as an album that is worth listening to as, you know, an album. There are a couple of radio friendly pop songs on it, but the entire album, every song, is lovely. Poignant. Difficult (in the sense that there are some confronting and challenging themes). Joyful. Sexy. Dopey/silly/fun. Funny. 

There's a song that's in 5/4 time, although it's done so well that you don't really notice it unless you're looking, which is just wild in this day and age of pop music. She writes all her own music, with assistance and collaboration, sure, but there's a musicality in her songs that I feel is lacking in modern popular music 

I like Tay Tay, she's a good one."
3762,Thanks. Just listened to it and “Clean” is grand.
3763,This is adorable. She doesn’t need it. I was harping on about how she brilliantly times things to her benefit. She already re-released a bunch of stuff and ended her insanely profitable tour. I’m pretty sure she’s on a break right now and sales were naturally going to slump because her rabid fans have already taken all of her bait. She will more likely flip more of her republican and undecided fans than she will lose sales. But buy that t-shirt anyway. I’m sure you’ll look so cute wearing it around town.
3764,Listen to the Folklore album. It was done with members of The National and Bon Iver. More folky and it’s excellent
3765,"I don’t appreciate her music too much… but I very much appreciate her lyrics, and I very much appreciate her personality, generosity… and political views!"
3766,Cat dads for Swift too!
3767,"This is super sweet, you’re a good dad 🫶🏽"
3768,"I was in Boston last year for Blink 182, it was the day after the Taylor Swift date at Gillette. Insane the amount of people in Boston. Everyone had on either a Blink shirt or a Taylor shirt. There was a big overlap of people doing both shows too. 

Blinks show this year was fantastic as well. And Green Day’s giant anniversary concert this year was insane"
3769,I'm Canadian
3770,"The Maryland senate race is super tight, and it's a seat that Dems need to hang on to if they are to have any hope of a majority in the Senate for Harris to work with if she wins. 

If the republican wins, Republicans will be able to block most everything, including judicial appointments. So if you have some cash to send her way, please support Angela Alsobrooks!"
3771,"if republican fathers banned / stopped buying  tay tay stuff for their daughters it would be fucking hilarious .

only a fool would want to go to war against teenage girls"
3772,Good thing the fans just buy stuff themselves since they are 20-30 crowd now
3773,"Yeah I remember the MAGA idiots running out and dropping a hundred or more dollars for a keurig and then destroying them in front of a camera for internet points.

I'm sure the Keurig company was like: No. Stop. Please. Don't do that again and again and again! :D"
3774,Every November.  And every other month.
3775,*Rated PG-13*
3776,"It’s especially bad for her to do this when she has enough money to just walk away. Imagine having enough money to just live off stock gains and saying, “You know what? I really enjoyed making 2 Girls 1 Cup and I think the audience deserves a sequel.”"
3777,"I remember when a bunch of them were vibing to ""Killing in the name"" while waving thin blue lives flags, the irony doesn't really get thicker than that"
3778,"Bribery helps, look at Rick Scott in Flori-duh."
3779,"Harris in a qualified and effective leader who quite clearly did not, but... JD Vance almost certainly bottomed his way into a senate seat and VP nomination..."
3780,it is indeed ridiculous.  I asked a guy at work if he thought that Biden chose her for VP because she slept with him.
3781,"> how he slept his way to the top with his donor.

I'm not sure I believe this.

He seems more like a bottom."
3782,Hard agree!
3783,*bonk*
3784,It's a concept of a rap.
3785,A duel with grenades?
3786,"""There can only be none"""
3787,"Donald in Charge of our days and our nights  
Donald in Charge of our wrongs and our rights  
And I sing, I want, I want Donald in Charge of me

Come to think of it, the lyrics seem to suggest Baio was into Trumpism long before we ever realized."
3788,Correctamundo!
3789,"Agree. Also can we just stop and remember for a moment when Trump said Megyn Kelly was “bleeding from somewhere” when he grossly insinuated her questions were *harder* because she might be on her period?

These “pick me” Republican women need to gain some self esteem and realize they don’t have to stoop to boot licking, even in their own homes."
3790,"Santa is Canadian, why do you think his suit is red and white. If you write to him the address  is :

Santa Claus

North Pole

Canada

H0H 0H0"
3791,Interesting fact. Polar bear skin is black. Just their hair appears white from reflecting light. The hair is hollow. 
3792,"Polar bears are actually black with translucent fur. They just Sleater white because of how the fur scatters light.

So Santa should be black with a white beard."
3793,"That's what people tend to forget about when it comes to her endorsement.

Her fans aren't just tween girls. 

Her first single came out 18 years ago. 

The Era's tour netted over a billion dollars. That money didn't come from tweens."
3794,"so I used to work in the entertainment industry. i'm about half a decade out so I'm not as in the loop as I used to be.. And I'm not that into celebs overall,  but one thing I know for sure.  Taylor Swift is a HUGE DRAW.  and its not just her instagram followers. Thats nothing.  think about the infrastructure that supports the entire music production and distribution, awards shows, red carpets, itunes listeners, etc.  without favored celebrities, there will not be the viewers as engaged in the product and that means fewer people to watch their ads, buy lp's off itunes, etc. that young lady is, literally, a skyscraper in the industry.  Everyone who is in the industry has a mutual interest in protecting the cash cow.  thats why I'm sure megan kelly is going to get a lot of pressure to just shut up"
3795,Don't forget that weird conspiracy nonsense Trump was spreading that the super bowl was rigged so that she could endorse Biden with Travis Kelce after the win. He's had a very creepy focus on her the entire year despite her doing absolutely nothing.
3796,"Honestly, I don't even care if they proceed to endorse Harris, Trump forcing a bunch of celebrities to effectively disown him and call him a liar would be hilarious. ""Tom Cruise says he doesn't like Trump and Trump ad is a fake"" is just funny."
3797,"Can't be doing with rhis edumacation thing! Why, an immigrant might be trying to eat my dog as we speak. Also that Kambala lady laughed once so CoMuNiSuM and also Sleepy Joe is both a victim of a Coup and and planned this, he's going to actually be the candidate, but it's all ok. Because the young, virile, stronger than strong Donald is gunna save us, just like last time, when I lost my job and wife and house. Still got my truck though"
3798,"If they lost market share over politics in that whole fiasco it's because they pissed everyone off, the loonies mad because AB supported Mulvaney and then everyone else because AB didn't have the integrity to stand by her afterward."
3799,I made sure to buy extra for a while.  I was willing to take the hit.
3800,"Yeah, they all moved to Michelob. Jokes on them - it’s owned by Budweiser."
3801,"Meanwhile DonOLDs Truth Social is in free fall and MAGA investors are losing their shirts. LOL

3802,Like Minneapolis??
3803,"That's deeply unfair to the Republican who have been chanting ""Repeal and Replace"" for about the past 14 years. You can't expect come up with a plan within a mere 14 years. 🙄"
3804,"Your move, Dolly!"
3805,"*Put narcotics into all of my songs*

*And that's why you're all singing along*"
3806,"I'm a guy in his 30's and my girlfriend has been a Swiftie for over a decade. Then the Era's Tour came to my city. So naturally I was subjected to hours or Taylor Swift classes and went to the show as well.

Yeah, I've been a Swiftie for nearly 2 years now and it's been pretty great. ""Willow"" is still my favorite of her songs, but ""Cassandra"" that released this year is very close to dethroning it."
3807,The Eras Tour isn’t over yet. It ends in December.
3808,She's beloved worldwide
3809,It should be mentioned that she re-recorded her first six albums because her original record company owned them. By re-recording them she was able to take full ownership of the new releases.
3810,"> She will more likely flip more of her republican and undecided fans than she will lose sales.

More than that, she likely just won a bunch of new fans!"
3811,You just convinced me to buy two shirts
3812,I know right? Rereleasing her music was a gangster move. 🤘🤘
3813,"I think that's one of the incredible things about Swift, is that her fans don't ditch her when they grow and new generations just keep adoring her."
3814,"Well, if someone actually enjoys that sort of stuff..."
3815,"The voters. Scott's company pulled off the largest healthcare fraud in U.S. history. The company was fined $1.7 B (that's right, 1.7 billion in fines) , now he's a U.S. Senator."
3816,But who did he fuck?
3817,He bottomed his way to the top?
3818,My 40 year old wife seriously considered spending 3000.00 for a ticket to a concert.  That is a level of commitment these Maga folks should be terrified of.
3819,"As soon as she posted her endorsement message, the Harris-Walz campaign began selling (pre-order) Friendship bracelets on their website. The bracelets were sold out by the next morning: [https://store.kamalaharris.com/harris-walz-friendship-bracelets/](https://store.kamalaharris.com/harris-walz-friendship-bracelets/)

If you're reading this and wondering what's the connection, that's because you're not familiar with the practice of exchanging friendship bracelets at Swift's concerts.

Her influence should **not** be under-estimated."
3820,"Don't forget, she tours and sells out in Spain, Sweden, Portugal and Japan... She will be just fine without the far right assholes here in the US. "
3821,"She’s already been told to just shut up by every network she’s worked for. She’s basically a shock jock for satellite radio, hoping to be controversial enough to attract attention."
3822,She doesn’t need to shut up. Swift fans are not dropping her over this stuff. If anything it creates even more buzz around her. She is beyond being cancelled.
3823,"Thanks for that insider info, I would never know that Taylor swift is a huge star without that."
3824,It’s not her he covets. It’s her crowd size he’s jealous of.
3825,Maybe she reminds him of his daughter.... *cringe*
3826,That’s basically what happens every time they play a song without permission at one of his rallies. There’s a long list of artists that have publicly admonished and sent cease and desists to Trump for using their music. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musicians_who_oppose_Donald_Trump%27s_use_of_their_music)
3827,"Yes and all because they chose to gift a trans person with a big social media following a can with her face on it or whatever. I guess we should be shunning all outliers… 

If we do decide to shun “weirdos” let’s start with people who can’t order 12 fucking donuts without seeming like he was just transported to earth from Alpha Centauri and has never made small talk with a “lower life form/ shop employee” before."
3828,And Portland.
3829,"I’m still waiting for Infrastructure week.

Surely that isn’t as complicated as Medical Insurance… right?"
3830,But the concept of a plan...totally almost done. Any day now. Maybe two weeks. After the audit.
3831,"They'd never be THAT stupid,  like trump is dumb dumb but even he knows not to insult the fairy-southern-godmother.  A move like that would actually turn the whole state of TN blue overnight.  

It's like that scene in 300 when Leonidas just goes on walk w his army ""pray they're that stupid"""
3832,"And I would bet that if it wasn't sold out before it will be now.

Well except for the maga turds we will see posting about how they shot their tickets to own the libs"
3833,Oh! I thought she was done. So she just completed the European leg in mid August and will be back in the states in  October. So this is a bit of a break for her. I don’t know most of her songs but I track her loosely because she is such a massive phenomenon and I cannot escape news about her. Even the tech journalist whose podcast I listen to is a fan. And I’ve been hoping she would back Harris.
3834,Even loosing a lot of Republicans will not make any significant dent to this worldwide superstar lol. Fucking delusional to think they hold any power to cancel her. I don't care much about her but I respect her influence
3835,Taxpayers
3836,"Seriously.  And considering she's been touring for almost 2 years straight to those prices still or higher, it's insane.  Completely sold out, huge demand for any resale, yeah.  Insane.  Let's hope it really kicks the swing states and Senate into overdrive."
3837,"and if her music doesn't work, she still has her football boyfriend who also can earn money. (/s)"
3838,"Wel that is not insider info, you can look it all up. go to [trends.google.com](http://trends.google.com) and you can put in their names and see the search activity.   the points she is not just a ""huge"" star.  There is a whole scale of stars. miley cyrus, rihanna, selena gomez, ariana grande, J-Lo, mariah carey, kanye, beyonce, etc. I am sure you can think many of those names as a huge star, due to their ""popular' music and house hold names status.  those guys cant touch taylor swift popularity. None of them. it is not close."
3839,"Whatever makes sense, okay?"
3840,"Never forget that when it got to be infrastructure week under Biden almost every  Republicans voted against it, and very few that didn't were pilloried for ""giving Biden a win."""
3841,"Infrastructure week happened. 

It's just now called the Infrastructure decade and is a product of Biden."
3842,Do we really need to test the stupidity of Donnie? He's dumb enough so I encourage him to go against Dolly's army and the Swifties. Crush MAGA into dust.
3843,"If they come for Dolly, we ride at dawn."
3844,"Okay but what if they get Kid Rock *and* Hulk Hogan to cancel her?? (/s because just the idea of them attempting to do that is quite frankly, hilarious to me!) :)"
3845,"If Taylor had stayed a country artist the republicans could cancel her like they did to the Chicks awhile back. However she transcended her country roots a long time ago. The MAGAs have no cancel power over her so they quake and rage to no effect.

Pretty funny to see has been MAGAs like Kelly making powerless threats though."
3846,"She's a billionaire with lots of paid for property.

She could stop songwriting and singing tomorrow and never worry about anything.

I'm not a pop fan but her music industry acumen is very admirable even if she is ruthless maintaining her spot in the charts."
3847,Some sprinkle stuff…
3848,The funniest quote of 2024. Even ahead of “I have concepts of a plan” coming from a man who’s now run for president 3 times.
3849,"Okay, good."
3850,"And then they all claimed credit for it, spineless bastards that they are."
3851,Rob Schneider might even have a tantrum on X about it
3852,We all know Hulk Hogan won’t get into a match that isn’t rigged in his favor beforehand.
3853,Well also if those Republicans stop buying Taylor’s stuff then we won’t buy any more Kid Rock. Cancel that Megyn!
3854,kevin sorbo too!
3855,You mean the one who's funding the upcoming The Apprentice movie about Trump?
3856,"That doesn't work for me, brother."
3857,Sounds a little like Trump

No way of knowing how many Swift fans are already registered in these areas but if her endorsement moves the needle at all in even half of these, Trump is probably fucked."
3860,">Her post encouraged first-time voters to be sure to register for the election, and a U.S. General Services Administration spokesperson reported on Wednesday receiving 337,826 visitors at vote.gov from a custom URL that Swift had shared.

>“I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them,” Swift posted. She called Harris a “steady-handed, gifted leader” who could lead the country with calm rather than chaos."
3861,Will people trying to decide between Vice President Harris and Trump be swayed by this? Probably not. Will some of her fans be more encouraged to come out to vote for Harris? Probably
3862,"It’s time to take our country back for good. No more Trump, no more MAGA. Laugh at their weirdness and shame them for backing the literal worst person ever. I have no sympathy or empathy for anyone who still to this day supports the orange buffoon."
3863,How’s Trump feeling about using that AI image of her now?
3864,The post is still gaining close to a hundred likes *per second*
3865,Hopefully all of them will vote. Really need the non-voters to show up this time as only way to avoid months of lawsuits to overturn results is overwhelming results for Harris and other Democrats.
3866,"My past opinion of Taylor was ""meh"".  Now I think she's awesome."
3867,"Her telling people to register (and doing it early) was the real big impactful thing she did here, moreso than just her endorsement-  she just inserted a BUNCH of first time voters into the voting system for the rest of their lives going forward. 

It’s crazy but this alone will be changing elections for decades to come."
3868,"The Swift fans that are NOT of voting age are the real danger to Trump. Have you seen a kid when they're fired up about something? Those kids are gonna know every fact about every policy and every instance of Trump being terrible and everything wonderful about Kamala, and they are going to hammer their parents over the head with those facts. Parents are going to vote Kamala just to appease the kids because they'll never hear the end of it otherwise."
3869,"Wonder how this will impact the political landscape, especially with younger voters."
3870,"Great, but please remember to actually VOTE!!!"
3871,It’s refreshing when truth and integrity triumph over deceit and pretenders.
3872,"It’s currently at 9.8M likes, I need it to cross 10M!"
3873,Monumental.
3874,Amazing how much influence celebrities can have on political engagement these days.
3875,"""none of that will make a difference""

-conservatives, right now"
3876,Any idea how many of those visits resulted in registrations?
3877,"More voices with weight like this please, pile it on. Thank you Taylor!"
3878,10:33 PM PDT  10M
3879,If she can even get 100k voters that would have never voted in the 2024 election normally to vote it would be a HUGE win for Kamala. The fact that we already might be seeing more people than that registering to vote is insane.
3880,[deleted]
3881,"Over 10, million likes now. Last I heard 337,000 had gone to the register sight anyone know what it's up to now?  Thanks"
3882,a force to be reckoned with
3883,It’s at 9.9 million in just about 24 hours. Damn. 
3884,"It was at this time, that J D Vance realized he fucked up…."
3885,"Idk if this makes me happy or scared. The way it reads is that there are a bunch of first time voters who are only now registering because a celebrity is voting a certain way

Like im happy that people are voting and for Kamala but it scares me that people were unwilling to vote in such a big election until a celebrity came along."
3886,"A little over 3 %….. 


We need MORE"
3887,If Swift were to sing at the inauguration…
3888,Make sure Russia doesn’t hack this one.
3889,Man I hope this turns the election around….
3890,"talking about voter regstration, anyone suing Elon over his fake voter registration site ?"
3891,And JD Vance claims Swift supporters are out of touch with reality?  The reality is that he may have as much to do with them registering to vote for Kamala as Swift.   He needs to keep talking. He's the best tool out there to convert votes to Kamala.
3892,"Well, I don't know all that much about Taylor Swift, but I  would suggest she ought think about staying out of Texas.  They do their best to try to arrest people for helping others register to vote there."
3893,The race is still so close every vote counts
3894,Good!
3895,Good girl
3896,"300k new voters is a body blow to Trump.

For context: Biden won Arizona by 11k votes. Wisconsin by about 21k votes. Georgia by 12k votes. Pennsylvania by 80k votes. Nevada by 34k votes. Michigan by 154k votes. He lost North Carolina by only 74k votes.

And that's before you get into the smaller states where the percentage margins for Trump are big, but the actual vote total is quite small. Its not likely Biden could win those states mind you, but if the race tightens up in any of them it forces the GOP to divert funds to protect any down ballot races that start to look vulnerable."
3897,"now see THIS, THIS is what truly matters. Dems everyday are checking and rechecking their voter status, people are taking time out of their schedules to volunteer and get people registered. They're doing this in DEEP RED territory. The fact that these efforts are aided massively by JUST ONE person's publishing of the link speaks volumes. Will there be people who click that link, that intend to vote republican? probably, but they will be very few and far between."
3898,Are these people going to vote ? Also do they live in those 7 states because others don’t matter at all
3899,My question is how has she managed not to trend on Twitter yet since the endorsement?
3900,"Tangential, but I’m just really bewildered by her cult of personality. Maybe because I’m not into celebrity culture or get really attached to specific musicians. I would not want to be her tbh. That’s…a lot of people."
3901,"I'll take Taylor Swift's advice into consideration, but I'm waiting to see what DJ Khaled says before I make up my mind."
3902,"Purely technical question, with a potential simple answer - how can they measure the clicks of the specific link she shared?"
3903,"I wonder what the demographics of Taylor Swift fans are. Where do they live? What is their average age? 

Could these potential voters be in swing states? Is she mostly popular on the coasts? Is she popular in the south?

I am glad to welcome her to the team. Again."
3904,Taylor thank you 💕🙏
3905,It's a bit scary how much power celebrities can have over elections. Although I am not complaining in this situation.
3906,"How does the data know this is the result from Taylor's post?  A lot could have been a result of the debate itself. 

Regardless of that, it is still great news that more people are voting."
3907,"thoughts and prayers, pop idol for sub-voting age clickers-style"
3908,"While this is great, it is so bizzare to me that fans actually care? Like, think for yourself people... If you're voting a certain way because your favorite celeb is voting that way, I have concerns about your decision making skills.

Edit: You guys are not reading what I'm saying lol. I'm not pissed she's endorsing biden, I'm glad. I find it weird that people let celebrities influence their vote. These mega celebs are some of the most out of touch people on the planet."
3909,This is stupid. Do we really want people to vote just because a celebrity they like told them to? This is what America has become? What a shitshow.
3910,Election interference!!
3911,Who fucking cares
3912,How many of those are 14 year old girls?  The majority of her followers.
3913,[removed]
3914,[deleted]
3915,If Swifties flipped Texas I'm pretty sure trump would explode 
3916,"EVERY show was sold out. So much so that Americans found it cheaper to fly to Europe to see her and did so. They just made it a Taylor Swift vacation. I thought it was crazy but I had patients who came in and told me that was what they were doing...and I was like ""oookaaay"". I'm a big Cure fan and I've seen them like twenty times but I'm not flying all over the world at a ridiculous cost to see them. Even in their prime...and in their prime I paid like $30 a ticket."
3917,"From someone living in the Valley, there is no way that Glendale has more Swifties than Phoenix, Scottsdale, Tempe, Mesa, Chandler or Gilbert. The first show of the tour was in Glendale and that must be inflating the number of interactions that originated from there.


Likewise, Arlington is home to AT&T Stadium and Santa Clara is home to Levis Stadium.


I'm still pumped about the endorsement, but I think the rankings are *heavily* skewed by concert attendance and many of those folks travel long distances for the shows."
3918,"All of the major swing states in 2020 were won by 5 figure margins. 300,000 voter registrations is significant"
3919,"300k is staggering. If some thousands of those are in a swing state, it absolutely matters. Remember Georgia with Trump begging for them to ""find"" 11k votes."
3920,The new voter registration number is more than 0.2% of the 2020 election turnout.
3921,We've been talking about how many new registrations she can inspire. Does anyone think this endorsement could also get anyone thinking of voting Trump to reconsider? 
3922,What was it in 2020 where it broke the site?
3923,300k clicks doesn't mean that many people registered...
3924,[deleted]
3925,The important focus isn't people who can't decide who to vote for. It's the people who haven't decided if they're going to bother voting
3926,"The conventional wisdom is that Trump voters are die-hard and nothing will change their minds.  But polls show that there's definite volatility.  Texas and Florida could be in play now.  Every vote counts, so if this endorsement nets another 50,000 votes here and there it can have massive impact."
3927,"She could go further if she wants, GOP would be wise to shut the fk up about her."
3928,Turnout wins elections
3929,Yeah I agree. I just think that the race being this close every little bit counts more than it normally does
3930,Yup. I’ve got a friend who is a serious Swiftie but also brainwashed by the MAGA cult. She believes last night’s debate monitors were unfairly biased against Trump. She’s an intelligent person who is otherwise a wonderful human being. The mind boggles.
3931,I value it as much for the slap in the face to Republicans and especially Trump/Vance as for any potential her choice may have to influence today's voters.
3932,"The bandwagon / momentum effect is real. People like to be a part of a *movement*, and Harris is becoming a movement. Democrats tend to win when this happens.

Ultimately we need to realize that peak voter turnout tends to be 66% of total eligible.

What this means is that there are *a lot* of apathetic voters out there who can be flipped from unlikely voters to likely voters; which, bear in mind, those unlikely voters are NOT captured by current polling."
3933,"Who cares about the undecided voters, they’re all morons anyway. The important thing is that Swift is getting Gen Z to vote and increasing the numbers if people likely to vote"
3934,Make Politics Boring Again.
3935,Trump asked for it. He is lucky she hasn't sued him. df deserves every bit of Taylor endorsing Harris.
3936,"At that rate, that's about 8.5m per day, maybe halve it to get variation over the day"
3937,Taylor has been making music for 20 years. It’s crazy to say her fans are not of voting age.  Maybe not all of them but I am betting a large portion maybe 30+% are of voting age.
3938,"My 15-year-old daughter literally sat with her friends at a local ice cream shop this afternoon, and watched the debate recording. I would be really surprised if she isn't an active voter in the 2028 election."
3939,And they’ll get parents to vote who otherwise might not have bothered
3940,"Yeah, what I rmbr most of my activist days as a teen in HS and college was that I had waaay too much free time to rly read abt everything"
3941,25% are actually boomers.
3942,Yes fucking right. My mom voted for Trump in 2016 and we were a Bernie household. That shit tore our family apart.
3943,"The more important thing, even if they can't sway their parents this year, is that their political direction for the rest of their lives is being set today.  If Republicans think it's rough on them now, imagine what it will be like in the future at the rate they're going."
3944,My 18 year old grandson can’t wait to vote.
3945,The room of political enthusiasts already knows that.
3946,It's just how things should work.. If you don't have some kind of ethics it makes working together to accomplish things much harder.
3947,Amen and it's about damn time. I'm tired of it across the board!
3948,9.9M @ 8:37PM PDT
3949,Over 10M now
3950,"It’s always been that way. Especially in music and TS isn’t even political in her music, or at least I don’t think she is (I don’t listen her stuff). The difference these days is that we have metrics we can quantify via social media."
3951,Fucked up if it’s true
3952,Imagine one person knocking on 10m doors making sure people are registered. That's actually insane to think about.
3953,"This is too low. 

The click number is super impressive as a singular number, but the known conversion rates are not exciting at all. And from the initial click, how many actually registered?

VOTE VOTE VOTE"
3954,Maybe im too high but 300k is 3% of the 9 million
3955,"That would be 3%, not 0.033%"
3956,Sad as it may seem this has been a thing for generations. Celebrities have pull. They are a driving force behind a lot of potential change in the world.
3957,You mean like when Donald Trump from The Apprentice entered politics?
3958,I don’t think it s unwilling as much as it’s just complacency
3959,"Probable that Xitter is suppressing it, because they support the other side."
3960,They know which site the incoming traffic originates from because the URL is unique to her link.
3961,"This data is just engagement resulting from her post. 9 million people liked and 300,000 people clicked the voter registration link she specifically linked. It’s not related to the debate other than the timing."
3962,It was based on click-thru of Taylor Swift's custom link so that it could be tracked.  There may be more who decided to register but didn't use her link and those are not counted.
3963,"I understand your perspective, but this has always had some level of impact. Look at the peace movements of the sixties. Politics represent life, and the arts do have their place. At the end of the day, if people are getting more involved, that's a win. 

It also begs the question: Are the fans following her lead on policies, or are they partially fans because of their shared values. Interesting stuff."
3964,Wow! Are you aware that Trump literally begging her for an endorsement at every turn?
3965,That's rich. Trump has been begging for Swift to endorse him for months. I can think of at least 6+ different approaches that were published throughout this campaign via internet sites.
3966,Many probably aren’t in tune with politics or apathetic
3967,It's less so people voting a certain way so much as people who wouldn't have voted at all deciding to vote 
3968,"Good or bad, young people these days need role models for inspiration and to shape their morals, from Madonna leading the way for female freedom, Lady Gaga fighting for the lgbtq, Beyoncé being a hero for the black community, etc. Maybe it shouldnt be this way but their influence on youth is huge and we should be thankful they use that influence for good. 

Lady Gaga said it once ""if your voice has revolutionary potential, its your responsibility to use it to make a change"".

They, just like Taylor, arent just celebrities, they are role models."
3969,"As it has always been, so shall it always be 🤷🏻‍♀️"
3970,"Why are you talking as if it's a new thing? It isn't. Celebrities, athletes, writers and other public figures' political endorsements existed long before your great-grandparent was a gleam in their father's eye. It isn't exclusive to the US, either. Also, Ronald Reagan was a Hollywood actor and Trump is a former reality tv star."
3971,Someone's mad Kid Rock hasn't had a hit in a quarter of a century.
3972,Rich coming from a Trump supporter.
3973,A significant chunk of voting Americans apparently.
3974,"You really care?  Aside from that, she has fans in every age group.  And beyond that, I love it that her younger fans are encouraged to check out voter registration, learn about what it is and how to do it for when the time comes.  I also love it that they are receiving their political lesson to research and decide from someone who plainly favors liberals and liberal causes.  Especially when the plain message from the dark side is against voting."
3975,"I know the perception, but Taylor Swift has been making charts and going at least platinum (1m+ sold) since 2007 at least. That was 17 years ago.

The first decade of fans are easily in their 30s by now, and that's even making the naive assumption that, as you  imply, that only 14 year old girls are her fans."
3976,"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1372971/taylor-swift-fans-by-generation/

Very few of them, only 11% are Gen Z (ages ~12-27) according to this data. Taylor Swift has been making music for nearly 20 years now. She's pushing 40, like the bulk of Millennials."
3977,That’s fun coming from someone who has scatter spammed the same comment (above) 30 times on different posts.
3978,Fuckwit Trump brought this on his own stupid ass by sharing an AI generated video purporting to be of her endorsing him.
3979,"You know, I'm a normal everyday person. I go to work, eat my lunch, go back to work and come home. I also tell people I'm voting for Kamala and I tell them why. Usually it's some person making a disparaging and uninformed remark that causes me to do so. 

Taylor Swift has a platform that I don't have and you don't have. I would do the same thing if I was Taylor Swift. Who wants to be on the wrong side of history if you are so famous you have the ability to move economies?"
3980,Kid rock and hulk Hogan ring any bells you silly silly thing
3981,"It'll be hilarious to see.  John Kerry got swift boated, but Trump could potentially get Swift voted."
3982,Imagine they flipped Texas AND got rid of Cruz
3983,I'm pretty sure the GOP would implode if swifties flip texas
3984,"So would I in the form of laughing so hard, I shit my pants."
3985,"I saw in r/Texas everyone roasted donald trump in the comments about how he did in the debate 😂

Edit: mispelled"
3986,"I'm skeptical of Texas flipping, but I can't even imagine the chaos that would start if it did. We all know Republicans are going to say the election was rigged if he loses, but a blue Texas would send the accusations into overdrive."
3987,if Swifties flip MO I will drive a truck load of gooey butter cake up I-70 for them
3988,"I know Texas is trending blue and might even flip in a few more election cycles so I'm expecting we will soon see more efforts made to combat this trend from the republican infrastructure there. More voter suppression, gerrymandering, purged voter rolls, condensed ballot box access in blue areas (cities), etc. It'll get uglier in Texas before it gets better."
3989,"If Texas goes blue, the Republicans will use it as ""proof"" that the election was rigged."
3990,"Swifities does seem very dedicated. I live by one of the arenas used in her latest tour, and I must say that even though the whole area was brimming with people the entire three or so days, they barely made a peep. This can be contrasted with when there's a local football match and it gets loud as fuck with maybe a third as many people."
3991,"I've seen The Cure, not really my kind of music but I'm a big fan of how Robert Smith pushed back hard on inflated ticket prices and scalping, a true artists artist."
3992,"It wasn't just based on concert attendance. They looked at Tiktok views, google searches, fan groups for those areas, etc. 

Those areas you mentioned probably have more Swift fans in terms of sheer numbers because population of say Phoenix vs Glendale would suggest that, but in terms of amount of engagement, these were the top cities. 

Maybe it's per population? Phoenix having a higher population means that per person, there is also probably a smaller percentage of Swifties in those areas, even if the actual hard numbers indicate more fans in general."
3993,"Important distinction is that there were 337,000 clicks to visit the website, not necessarily voter registrations. We have no idea how many of those clicks resulted in voter registrations yet AFAIK."
3994,"Imagine if Taylor Swift herself grew up in a swing state.  Perhaps Northeastern...*Pennsylvania?*

😲"
3995,And that’s in less than a day. They’ll keep coming.
3996,"That's an average of 6k per state. With more coming in from more populace states than the small, 3 electoral vote states that go very red every election cycle."
3997,Sadly Georgia’s voter registration page went down last night for “scheduled maintenance.” How convenient.
3998,"Additionally, how many of those 300,000 will encourage their friends to register too?

That 300k could turn into a million new voters fairly quickly."
3999,"That's clicks, not people who registered to vote."
4000,"Its roughly 1 out of every 1000 Americans she just influenced. 

Doesn't sound like much on its face, but if I could influence 1/1000th of the country to do *anything* with a single social media post- much less something like participate in democracy- bet *all* your farms I'd do it."
4001,"Probably 100 clicks for one registration though. 

Clicks != conversions"
4002,"Registering is not voting. 

Every election since the mid-nineties has liberals pushing these huge voter registration movements, millions of new young, scrappy kids put on the rolls, only for them to lose all interest by November. 

I’m happy to hear about younger people involving themselves more and more in local and national politics, but I remain hesitant to start celebrating a swiftie voting movement surprising us all with thousands of new voters."
4003,"300k clicks on a link ≠ 300k new registered voters, and out of the ones who do register for the first time, a much smaller percentage will actually vote. 

Like, it's great that Taylor Swift endorsed Harris, but she's endorsed candidates and bills in the past without much effect. Anyone remember the insane hype when she endorsed Phil Bredesen in Tennessee in 2018 and everyone was saying she would swing the Senate to Democrats? He lost by 10 points."
4004,And illegal migrants will possibly be able to vote so she could win!
4005,States could be decided by 10k votes. 300k new voters could change everything.
4006,And that’s just the first day.
4007,0.2% *so far*. I don't expect Taylor to campaign for Harris but now that it's publicly stated she has endorsed her the ball may roll on it's own between now and registration deadlines.
4008,That's not voter registrations. It's website clicks.
4009,I think her stated reason for making her preference public - that Trump deliberately used an AI generated fake video purporting to be of her endorsing him - just might have some effect on Trump voters who aren't all in for him.  People are afraid of AI and using it that way might earn some disapproval.
4010,"The fuck are you talking about?! Taylor Swift was born in Pennsylvania. She's an American. Also, you have a very loose definition of ""meddling."" Sharing a link to the voter registration site and telling people to register and who you support is meddling? Like, that's the least version of meddling I could think of when commenting on politics."
4011,What foreign citizen?
4012,"Which is a LOT of young people, especially when the race was between two senile old geezers.

Now that the Democrats dumped Biden, Harris is far more energetic and appealing to voters who aren't knocking on death's door."
4013,"For real. Back in 2016, almost every single liberal I knew just ... didn't vote. They were too busy that day, or weren't feeling well, or didn't think it would matter since Hillary was obviously going to win. I was only able to convince one friend to go to the polls with me. It was only \*after\* Trump won that a lot of regret hit and the ""I should've made time to vote"" pity party started.

So if this motivates more people to turn out to the polls, that's a great thing. If Dems had higher turnout, they'd never lose an election, because there are simply more liberals in the USA than there are conservatives. Their turnout rates are just lower, and they are more prone to infighting or protest voting rather than trying to vote strategically like conservatives tend to."
4014,"Pretty sure I recall the Pod Save American guys noting data that showed that at least 25% of Trump votes are in play. It’s also important to note that dems have a weakness with young gen z men and that demographic has been registering more new voters than other demographics that would likely vote dem. That’s why you see Trump courting the bro vote by going to bitcoin conferences, cozying up to Musk, leaning on Dana White, etc. So, Swift convincing gen z women to register and get out and vote could make a massive difference in mitigating Trump’s success there."
4015,"One poll recently showed Texas as a toss-up, and even if an outlier is a huge deal. I know the Swifties can help Harris win Texas, and thus turn Texas into THE battleground state."
4016,"In general I agree that it's mostly about driving new registrations and motivating her already registered fans to vote.

That said, swifties are obsessed with her. They basically worship the woman. I would not be surprised if her endorsement carries a lot of weight for any of her fans who are currently undecided. Maybe the most weight of any endorsement Kamala could get for a non-insignificant amount of people, considering what the margins were in 2020.

At a minimum she's motivating more votes than Ted Nugent. I'll happily take it."
4017,If Trump keeps showing us that he can't control himself things are going to shift even more.  If he wasn't shameless he'd hide in his house for a week after the way he acted last night.
4018,"Texas and Florida are not, nor will they ever be in play so long as the current crop of Republicans remain in control of those state governments. They will absolutely fix those elections this year, and the only reason to expend any valuable resources in those states is to expose their corruption."
4019,plz host a get out the vote drive or concert of whatever
4020,Also voting.
4021,"> brainwashed by the MAGA cult  
> She’s an intelligent person

Pick one."
4022,"She doesn't need the money. If he loses the election, at least, he's going to be in severe financial peril."
4023,"They didn't say that all her fans are not of voting age. They said ""the ones that are not""."
4024,Inredible stat that 25% are boomers! 21% are Gen X so nearly half are over 45 and then Millennials can vote too!
4025,Reread that again. They didn’t make a statement on her whole base. Only speaking to the future threat to MAGA folks for those who are now NOT voting age. Like my niece and all her besties which are 12-13…
4026,My wife’s 40 and is a big fan. Our daughters (3&6) listen to Swift every night.
4027,"I am in no way saying ALL her fans are not of voting age, but there are tons of younger fans."
4028,Your kid and her friends sound like a smart group! You are doing something right!
4029,"2016 was an aberration. There were a fair number of single-issue voters, and that single issue was that they didn't like Clinton.

Some of her baggage was fairly unique, such as Serbo-Americans having a beef with her."
4030,Helms deep wasn't won without motivation of the very thing they knew they had to do.
4031,It's a bit more complicated for the conversion considering shes a global mega star and a significant portion of her audience are not from the US
4032,"For sure, plenty of the population don't pay attention and don't have any interest."
4033,Ok I see the link now. I thought it was a generic link but it's a specific url referral. That makes sense on how it's tracked. Thanks for clarifying!
4034,"For sure, none of that is lost on me. I just find it a little concerning that something like this can have a tangible impact."
4035,"First off, It’s always disgusting to me when people mindlessly follow celebrities as if they are some kind of moral compass for them. Secondly, not many people in history command as much popularity as Taylor swift.. because she sings songs about shitty boyfriends doesn’t mean she knows what’s right in other areas."
4036,Fuck kid rock and Trump too.
4037,lol truth
4038,I’ve never voted for Trump nor will I. But it’s people like you that make me not vote for the left. You think you know everything and are superior than everyone else.
4039,"It was AI generated images of Swift fans endorsing him, but your point stands."
4040,"OK, if you came up with that on your own, bravo, sir, bravo"
4041,"Then, after the election, we’ll all hear how he lost by a whisker."
4042,Chef's kiss 🤌
4043,"Quip of the year, definitely"
4044,Nice
4045,pure joy
4046,Cancun cruz needs the boot
4047,"I’ll buy his plane ticket to Cancun if he just gives up now. One way though. 

With Reddit’s help I can even go as high as first class."
4048,"They would totally invalidate the votes in TX, abbot and Paxton are not gonna let a democrat take those EVs without a fight"
4049,"I was at the Portugal show and there was recorded sesismic activity during the show, made national news. The same thing happened in many other cities."
4050,"I mean look up the videos of theaters when they released the eras concert “movie”. It’s just a bunch of women vibing and having wholesome fun enjoying something they share in common.

I remember when they were in Philly and the city was packed but the vibes were so positive. Sure there are crazy fans out there, every group has them, but I’d rather be a Swiftie convention than a NASCAR track day."
4051,"i went to the santa clara show, got burned in 100 degree sunshine, but after it was all said and done, i got a 3 hour epic which felt like a full wrestlemania x-seven. I don't think any other band will come even remotely close to that production value and she's done it around the states, asia and europe a 100 damn times. Tickets are expensive, but my word was it worth it"
4052,"Good point, I’ll also just click on links sometimes even if I don’t have a reason to, so there’s some of that too. What I’m really hoping for is that she motivated her younger fans to actually show up and vote, since Gen Z and millennials have pretty horrible voter turnout"
4053,I’m really really hoping she does a concert in PA for the campaign for a rally.
4054,She's from Reading which is Southeastern PA.
4055,"I was high in the sky with Pennsylvania under me

Are there still beautiful things?"
4056," That's a solid point, and it's interesting to see how much of an impact endorsements like this can have. Even if some of those clicks don’t translate to votes directly, getting people registered is a step in the right direction. And yeah, it's all about turnout these days."
4057,I really hope that Georgia can get rid of their current representatives and get better ones. Georgia is an amazing state (in the parts that aren't rural and sketchy). I hope it becomes reliably blue at some point in the future. Because it'd sure be nice to live Savannah. Arguably the prettiest city center in America
4058,Could have just been unable to handle the influx
4059,"These are not registrations, they're clicks."
4060,"I’m interested in how many clicks actually lead to registration, roughly speaking. Currently the voter registration total in PA is 8,878,961

Remind me in a week to check back and see if there was a spike among democrats. Obviously not a perfect science but close enough"
4061,There's also 9 million likes.
4062,"And some of those who clicked will have discovered that their registration is still active, but it's still movement in the right direction"
4063,Ok. And?
4064,"Yeah but even then, that's 3000 voters in 24 hours. In a close election where states can be decided by even less than that... that's huge."
4065,That’s generous.
4066,"Two major factors people in this thread seem to be completely ignoring right now:

1. Taylor's audience stretches far, *far* beyond the US and it's not like the link she included is region locked.
2. There's no way to factor how many already registered voters clicked on that link. 

Don't get me wrong, her endorsement pulls a ton of weight into the Kamala camp, and every new registered voter is a good thing, but realistically the number of people who actually registered to vote within the states as a result of her post is likely a fraction of a fraction of that 300k."
4067,That number was from 2 PM ET. Very impressive.
4068,I just hope and want these new registered voters to actually get up and go vote for real.
4069,Technically you are right.
4070,Does birtherism extend even to T-Swift now?!
4071,"Interestingly enough trumps core support is men 25-55, people over 65 are net positive for Harris"
4072,"“If the Lord had a ring cam, Joe Biden would be on that thang”"
4073,"To be fair, if they live in a seriously solid red/blue state I can't exactly blame them if they decide not to vote in the presidential race. 

But they are fucking morons for thinking ""I don't like either candidate in one of the many elections happening that day"" is a good reason not to vote at all."
4074,Gen Z women are WAY more left leaning than previous generations.  I have a feeling that a lot of these men will come back around if they don't want to die a virgin.
4075,Host a series of concerts in swing states immediately following the election where an 'I Voted' sticker is required to get in the door.
4076,Yeah I know but I’m being serious. I have no idea how she’s processing the constant cognitive dissonance because she *knows*. It’s weird.
4077,"She doesn't sue for money, she sues on principle."
4078,"I don't think so. He sells gold sneakers, assassination branded gold sneakers, bobble heads, pins, shirts, NFTs, he will still make money from DJT, I believe he is planning a crypto, he solicits donations, he can make bundles on speaking, books, his daughter and son in law are set for life with 2 billion. Sadly I don't think he will ever see financial peril.   His money comes from his brand and licensing his name.  People pay for his shit."
4079,Yeah. I saw an article earlier 337k clicks on her voter registration link.  So lots of Gen X and it’s hasn’t even been 24 hours.
4080,Was talking to this lady in line telling me how she bought tickets for the upcoming show in New Orleans for 3k. She's going to fly to see her and sit front row area and has to be in her 60s.  The enthusiasm is staggering across decades.
4081,Political orientation formed at an early age is exceedingly difficult to change later on.  Especially when the party seeking to change it is a bunch of assholes.
4082,"No she thought he was genuinely intelligent. She hung portraits of him and his family members in her office at work with little quotes and slogans under each one. Her argument was ""im a democrat socialy, but a republican financially"" which fucking tracks now that I look back at it because she tanked every single business she has ever tried to run."
4083,"I know at least 3 older women (50s to 60s) who hate trump but ""just couldn't bring myself to vote for Hillary"""
4084,"The fact that Trump won in 2016 shows that we're approaching Idiocracy.  That a mega celebrity has some impact on voter registrations is a baby step towards civic responsibility and is a good sign, not a worrying one.  There are many mega celebrities who don't want to dirty their hands by touching politics and that's the real shame.

Politics matters and people who remain silent are essentially saying it's unimportant, no need to get involved.  Granted every election is described as being ultra important but this one really is.  This is no time to be on the sidelines."
4085,"Tell Trump that. He has been begging Swift throughout this campaign for an endorsement.  I was wondering if the grift would try to buy her endorsement. 

**HARRIS/WATZ 2024!**"
4086,You really shouldn’t be surprised or concerned. It’s been a key driver of the cultural evolution of humans since the beginning. It’s called prestige bias. It serves an important purpose in the success of our species.
4087,"Trump's margin of victory was 70,000 when he technically won 2016.  300,000 new voters is significant."
4088,That's all it takes for you to not want to vote for the left? And you're disgusted by people being motivated to register to vote because of a celebrity endorsement?
4089,Thanks for the correction.  Appreciate it.
4090,"Sarcastically, of course."
4091,"""I said that?"""
4092,"When he loses there won't be any whiskers left to lose by, they'll have all been eaten by the trans illegals."
4093,A cat whisker?
4094,But only the Presidental votes. Down ballot votes that go Republican would still be accepted.
4095,Gen Z and Millennials (of which I am one) under performed in polls compared to their actual turnout in 2022. Hoping that continues to be the case. I have no doubt that this endorsement will absolutely positively impact Harris's chances in November though.
4096,She is having a concert in Florida like right before the election… and abortion is on the ballot there… just sayin
4097,"She should do a concert in every swing state during their early voting period, and end in PA. Call it the ""Get out and vote"" tour. Sadly, I'd imagine it's too late in the game to plan something like that, but it would definitely move the needle if she had."
4098,celebrities getting together for a movement is really impactful
4099,Then that would have been unscheduled and not what the website claims
4100,Which is just slightly above average for a Taylor Swift post. The last time she had more likes was 10m on June 22nd with a photo of her and Prince William. Before that was 10m in April and 15m in  February announcing her new album. She regularly gets 7m or 8m on many of her posts.
4101,"Just keeping it real as clicks do not automatically equal registration. Hopefully, those clicks actually did lead to completed registration."
4102,"In 2000, Florida (and because of that the rest of the country) was “won” by a little over 500 votes."
4103,"Trump's core support is dudebros who watch too many podcasts and still think they just need to find the right get rich quick scheme and they'll totally be a billionaire. The guys who go through a hundred 'girlfriends' because they're such chodes that they get dumped within a week, and might singlehandedly be responsible for the result of that man vs bear debate a few months ago. Misogynistic, protein-powder brained, sheltered-ass easily manipulated 'alphas' with multiple DUIs, porn addictions, and 3 crypto accounts that have a dollar between them.

I can't wait for that expired orange lump of lard to get off the political stage and take those pricks with him. The only representation those guys deserve is at their family court trials."
4104,"This was me. I live in a deep blue state, was uneducated about the process, and was thinking about other things when I was a teenager. It also wasn't exactly encouraging when people on the internet would insult and shame people like me. I realized later that I was wrong and now vote in every election. Plus between the memes, the feeling of hope and joy, people generally being encouraging instead of mean, and a candidate I'm actually excited about, I'm pretty hype this time."
4105,"That probably isn’t legal. It’s essentially paying for votes.

These anti-voter intimidation laws have very good reasons for existing, too."
4106,"I work with someone who is crazy smart.  Like doing fractions in their head.  Able to draw out plans to build a deck, shed, whatever.  Good ideas when it comes to fixing things. 

Otherwise a joy to be around. 

MAGAtrumper and racist at times.  It's boggling."
4107,The answer is to make him owe so much that any money he makes is forfeit. The Steve Bannon treatment.
4108,"I'd assume nearly all Gen X have registered. Gen Z, now, they're the ones who are most likely not to have registered."
4109,"Well, now they have an out."
4110,Wild to me that anyone would be on the sidelines in the last 3 elections.
4111,I'm not suprised at all. Just concerned.
4112,Yeah. I don’t want to be a part of a massive group of people that thinks they know what’s best for everyone and is more than willing to use force to obtain their end goals. I don’t support people that act superior to others. As a collective the left are a bunch of people who act like they are doing society a favor when in fact they are authoritarian to the max just like the right are a bunch of fascists. I refuse to lick either boot.
4113,He'd let Cruz go. nobody like Cruz
4114,As is recreational weed
4115,Nah 1 week advance notice pop up concerts would have fans calling out of work and driving hundreds of miles. Plenty of time.
4116,"1 Live streamed /televised event,  say.....halloween weekend.  

Big registration push till local deadlines close out, then a nationwide get out the vote effort. Not just getting swifties to vote, but making sure they get friends and family out as well. TS has the ability to appeal to a large demographic while not exposing Harris to some of the attacks that could come from pandering to TS fans.  Then add all the dudes trying to gain favor with Swifties.  

This is a blue leaning group that tends not to vote consistently- and maybe not one easily and effectively reached by traditional campaigns.

You're going to see the most lopsided popular vote run up in modern history.  The challenge is going to be getting that into the 270 + electoral college votes.  

The GOP has not won the popular vote since 2004 in a presidential election.  

The other trend is turn out - 66% voted in 2020 - which was the highest % since 1900.  If that is exceeded in 2024 people will point to Swift. 

Did Tump not know that AI meme was fake and unauthorized?  Seriously- not the guy who should have the nuke codes if he didn't, and a testament to an epic ego takedown if he did.  

She has the power to take the media off of anything that even looks like a Trump turnaround.  Money can't buy that, at this point, it's the most powerful piece on the board.  If used sparingly and strategically it's game over."
4117,Scheduled maintenance sounds better than are we getting DDOSed??
4118,Can't discredit the fact that 9 million people liked an endorsement of a president candidate.
4119,"Yes. There is a funnel:

* W clicks * c1% =
* X registrations * c2% =
* Y votes cast * c3% =
* Z votes for Harris

It’s still important, but just eyeballing it I’d be surprised if the total conversion was more than 30%. Still huge! Still important! But some people won’t vote, some found they were already registered, etc."
4120,"Ok, but also 1. not everyone who registers to vote as a result of the post will use the link and 2. many people may also be persuaded to vote for Harris by it who are already registered"
4121,Yes exactly. Thanks for the backup.
4122,No one is saying it is
4123,"Hey I’ll have you know people who chug protein, view porn and dream of getting rich quick totally still vote for Harris! 

I am one of them. In my defense, I don’t give a shit about alpha nonsense and I don’t objectify women or quickly go through relationships, and my btc account has thousands in it. 

Maybe it’s my ADHD that has me like this, a twisted amalgamation of gymbro, nerd and theatre kid, but I’ve been voting Democrat since my first election in 2016 and baffled how anyone could see Trump as a possible *solution* to anything at all. 

Can’t wait to see an election without the orange fuckface on the ballot… literally haven’t experienced it once in my adult life :("
4124,">Trump's core support is dudebros

Trumps core support is non-college educated white people."
4125,Might be ok if the requirement is just a sticker since that could be from a voter of either candidate.
4126,Lawyer disagrees.  Strongly.
4127,How can you tolerate being around such a person?  I have ended friendships over their support for Trump and I don't miss those people one bit.
4128,"Sounds like you consider yourself pretty superior to people who ""lick either boot""."
4129,hell yeah
4130,absotutely
4131,"Just because i think this is relevant - a lot of states voter registration is way before halloween, including some important swing states. She'd need to do this early October. 

Just to specify a few states that people might care about as swing states or states where politicians pull de-registering crap: Arizona, Georgia, Ohio, Florida, Texas - october 7th. 
Pennsylvania - october 21.
Nevada and Wisconsin allow same day in person registration. North Carolina allows in person during early voting which typically goes through the day before election day.

ETA source: https://vote.gov/register"
4132,"It’s not that surprising that 9 million people like Harris enough to tap a button while they scroll social media, especially since people outside the USA can also like the post. "
4133,"It's not an ad for something you buy, the dynamics of it may be different."

So with a presidential election year I'm sure it's a big number. Feels good"
4135,"I was replying to the person who said ""Ok. And?"" with a realist perspective. I'm all for Taylor endorsing Kamala and hoping Swifties mobilize to get out and vote, but that comment was warranted a reality check."
4136,They see Trump as a possible *final solution* which is why they're voting for him.
4137,Right answer.  Would absolutely be OK.
4138,Because 95% of our work relationship has nothing to do with any of that stuff.
4139,I’m not superior to anyone. You asked though so I’ll be more clear. I refuse to vote for people who are willing to throw away our freedoms for safety. I refuse to vote for people who support more state intervention and I refuse to vote for people who think they know what’s best for me while acting morally superior to others.
4140,"IL resident here.

dispensaries are a godsend. no more fukin around hunting for weed."
4141,Free admission for fans who registered to vote this year.
4142,"But by not voting you're essentially forfeiting your right to complain about the results regardless of who wins. Choosing not to participate in the process (and no, 3rd party voting doesn't count until there exists a legitimate chance a 3rd party candidate could win) just means you're fine with either party winning."

I’m tired of our tax dollars going to Illinois and Michigan because our fucked up state legislature refuses to be sensible."
4144,"“Wait wtf is going on with the Texas vote this year""

""Taylor is doing a four-city tour there in October""

""Blue Texas it is."""
4145,You’re a genius. It’s an awesome idea.
4146,"Sadly that's illegal:

https://votescount.santacruzcountyca.gov/NoIncentives.aspx

(That link is to a county in California, but it refers to federal law, and I thought it was a good link because it specifically refers to ""admission of an entertainment event"" as being an illegal incentive).

I think there are some valid arguments for why it should be legal to reward someone for registering to vote or voting, so long as you aren't encouraging them to vote for a specific person or party, and rewarding them regardless of how they vote. But as it stands now, it's not legal (and though many restaurants do it anyways with treats to people who wear an ""I Voted"" sticker, and everyone looks the other way, I doubt the GOP will let Taylor Swift get away with it)."

Those are your 3 things, huh? And you need more info on the candidates?

My goodness, the 2024 undecided voter is a confounding thing."
4150,"I just can't with these ""undecided voter"" articles at this point. Yes, it's good that they're giving Harris a look, but it's just so freaking demoralizing that THIS is the caliber of decision making that determines who becomes President.  In the 60's and 70's etc, this degree of uncertainty might be excusable.  Back then, you had two parties that overlapped on maybe 40-50% of topics and disagreed on other issues of varying importance.   

These days, one party wants a democracy, and one wants a christian nationalist authoritarian regime.  The two are both so very far apart that if you don't favor one or the other already, you're either catastrophically uninformed and disinterested, or suffering from some kind of mental illness."
4151,The dumbest people decide the fate of this country and it's beyond depressing.
4152,">She said her taxes were lower when Trump was in office and recalled the sting of COVID-19 shutdowns.

No. No they weren't. The tax code is essentially the same. No one has raised taxes.

This person ""thinks"" or ""feels"" like their taxes went up, when in actuality there are other factors at play, such as they made more money during the Biden administration so they paid more in tax, or they paid less in during the year so they had to pay more in with their tax return.

This article was so frustrating to read, but as a CPA this bit at the end boiled my blood."
4153,"The folks that are acting like Kamala Harris has been the president and not just the VP these past 4 years are fucking annoying. I’ve heard more than one of these “undecided voters” say “she’s been there for four years, why hasn’t she done any of these things?” 

by their line of logic anything “good” they believe Donald Trump did in his term should be attributed to Mike Pence"
4154,This is the thing about undecided votes. They are stupid. Incredibly so.
4155,"At this point ""Undecideds"" are just embarrassed and lying about the fact that they plan to vote for Trump for a third time."
4156,"I really don't get it why it's a question at all. Come, Trump and his kids were convicted to not participating or starting charities again, because they stole from a charity for kids with cancer. A civil court found him guilty of rape. He was found guilty for 34 felonies, several trials are still going on. He broke the record for telling lies as a president, the only thing he successfully managed as he president was giving himself and the rest of 1% a tax break, for which the rest of the population is still paying.



Jee wiz, who ever should I vote for?"
4157,"Being that I live in a neighboring county of Bucks, I understand the sentiment of the people interview in the article.  Bucks County used to be a strong Republican turnout in past elections until 1992.  Since then, the county has been a ""lean Democrat"" within 5 percent lead.  In 2016, Hillary won the county by less than 1 percent.  In 2020, Biden won the county by 4.4 percent.  If Kamala can get a similar margin as when Obama did in 2008 (he won by 9 percent over McCain), then that will be great.  But I am not expecting that.

The people who were interviewed are unfortunately not as educated on economics and politics as they should be.  I know of some who live in that county that think that way.  It is really hard to convince those people that no, things weren't all great when Trump was President."
4158,">  I think if someone would say, you know, this is what I’m going to do to improve life in the United States, I definitely would vote for them.

Kamala: *Mothafucka*, have you not been listening?!"
4159,"This feels like they’re just arbitrarily moving goal post around.

I’m starting to think these “undecided” voters already decided on trump."
4160,Without more context I’m guessing she means someone who can freeze time and put in place her percetption of those “rosy” values. Ignoring that those values never existed and more likely then not penalized others.
4161,"> this is what I’m going to do to improve life in the United States, I definitely would vote for them

Did Kamala not mention anything about a $50,000 tax deduction to start-up small businesses or $6,000 child tax credit?

Funny how all the undecideds tune her out any time she mentions something that will improve their life"
4162,"Gotta say, I’ve seen a lot of interviews with undecided voters and they are all bad listeners (to put it lightly). Harris will say she’ll restore RvW and they’ll say “she dodged the question of abortion” or she’ll lay out a couple solid policies on how to help the American people and they’ll say “she still hasn’t talked at all about policies”. They seem to be undecided not because it’s a toss up but because they’re incapable of making a decision."
4163,"This nonsense narrative has gotten so strong, I think sharing kamalaharris.com/issues as much as possible to get people to visit would be a great move. Put that to bed and take away the excuse a lot of people have to waiver."
4164,"The Democrats are not doing a good enough job of engaging these people. It could cost them the election again just like it did in 2016. All they do is show them graphs about how great the economy is doing, and ignore the fact that none of that is having any impact on the people that are struggling the most. These are the voters that are going to decide the election, and Harris has no idea how to connect with them on their level and talk with them in a way that resonates with them.


Meanwhile you've got Trump saying that he's going to fix everything and make their lives great again. How is he going to do it? No one knows. Is he going to do it? Almost certainly not. But he's acknowledging that things are hard for them, and they *love* him for that. I don't think the Democrats realise how much their constant ""look at the economy"" is actually hurting them because of how insulting it comes across to the voters living in the key swing states. "
4165,"But the price of eggs!!!! 

Let’s be real, there’s a HUGEEEE gender component at play here."
4166,It’s wild to think that the fate of the country is gonna be decided by these people.
4167,"This is why I'd much rather pander to disenchanted people on the left, since they outnumber these idiots in the middle by millions. We wouldn't lose a bunch of reliable Democratic voters by running on a platform that includes Medicare for All, for example, and what we'd gain with new voters would more than make up for the loss of a few percentage points of people in the middle. 

Maybe the Democratic Party will figure that out at some point and make the Republican Party politically irrelevant."
4168,"Apparently you and I are kindred spirits because the same part got the biggest rise out of me. I immediately said ""no they weren't"" out loud."
4169,They’re acting like any legislation that would benefit the country hasn’t been deliberately blocked by the senate to avoid the Dems having a “win”
4170,They’re just racists who are unwilling to admit it and miss the attention they got in 2016 for their “economic anxiety”
4171,"Kamala: ... *Former president*, have you not been listening!?"
4172,"Most of these people, no. They're not. 

The average american has almost no exposure to actual political news. At most, they'll hear a couple headlines on the nightly news, *if* they even bother to watch it. My parents, being the rural conservatives they, watch the news every single night. Local and national. Surprisingly enough it's usually ABC. Even so, they don't know the first thing about either candidate's platform or the real issues at stake.

And my parents are traditionally intelligent people. Both are college educated. One of them worked at Microsoft for all of the 80's and 90's and retired from a regional management position. But they're old. They don't follow any social media and they don't seek any information past what they hear in passing. They're willingly ignorant, and that's the issue for a large portion of the voting population."
4173,It’s coming from the mouth of a black woman…they won’t look for her message so she has to make sure they hear it half a dozen times before it sinks in.
4174,Bingo
4175,"From the debate;

>I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people. And that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity economy. Because here's the thing. We know that we have a shortage of homes and housing, and the cost of housing is too expensive for far too many people. We know that young families need support to raise their children. And I intend on extending a tax cut for those families of $6,000, which is the largest child tax credit that we have given in a long time. So that those young families can afford to buy a crib, buy a car seat, buy clothes for their children. My passion, one of them, is small businesses. I was actually -- my mother raised my sister and me but there was a woman who helped raise us. We call her our second mother. She was a small business owner. I love our small businesses. My plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction to start-up small businesses, knowing they are part of the backbone of America's economy.

This is just one example. They are proposing things and it's not just graphs. I don't buy the ""they're not reaching out to these people"". These people aren't listening or simply don't want to."
4176,"The economy _is_ doing better, numbers-wise.  They're close to achieving the coveted “soft landing” and inflation and unemployment is about where it was 4 years ago.  Its important for them to highlight that to combat the noise about the economy being terrible.

The issue is the inflation spike drive prices sky high, and they aren't going to go down much without a recession.  Harris numerous times outlined plans to grow the middle class, introduce tax credits, build new housing, and control price gouging.  Those are actual plans to help people.  She repeats this at every campaign event."
4177,"What do you think would be an effective message?

Personally, I these people are fundamentally dishonest. They WANT to be lied to. That’s why they listen to Trump.

Look, what politician out there is pushing policies that would materially help the working class more than Bernie Sanders? And these are the kind of people that would call Sanders a communist that’s out to destroy America. The sad fact is that these people are victims of a scam, and like most all victims of a scam, they do not want to hear the truth."
4178,"I do wonder demographically though if a lot of these disenchanted left leaning voters are in the swing states or not. 

And I think the youth vote can never be heavily relied upon. Generation after generation youth turnout is just notoriously bad."
4179,Now I want a Sam Jackson movie where the TV dub for ‘mother fucker’ is ‘former president.’
4180,"No. That is not targeted at this specific type of person. Harris doesn't even acknowledge that this type of person exists, and neither does Reddit apparently. 


Houses aren't an issue for them, they live in places where houses are dirt cheap. It's quality of life, jobs and improvement of their environment that they want. Trump promises them that, Harris talks as if every poor person in the USA is a young city dweller who can't afford an apartment. That's not a strategy that's going to work because the lowest class in the USA are also the ones in the most competitive parts of the swing states. "
4181,"Okay, but these people don't care about any of that, it's not even relevant to most of them, and they are the people that are going to decide the election. 


This complete refusal to even acknowledge the existence of the poorest class in the USA cost Hillary in 2016, and it could do it again. Maybe some of Harris's policies will trickle down and help them, but they don't think they will and that's all that matters. Trump actually goes to these places and talks to them like equals, and they believe and trust him. That's something the Democrats can't seem to do. "
4182,"As I said. It was one example. Also, it was not only about cost of housing. It mentioned the $6k tax cut for families, which if anyone in the group you're referring to have children it would benefit.

She also said:

>...what we can do that is about giving hard-working folks a break in bringing down the cost of living. 

She has also brought up how she wants to make rent more affordable many times. It's one of the first two points of her way forward [platform on her website.](https://kamalaharris.com/issues/?utm_medium=ads&utm_source=Google&utm_content=Search-Issues-PH-KH-Ad1&utm_campaign=EVG&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwooq3BhB3EiwAYqYoEnhSD_-OFljNnmeUM-Ybq9k7BvbJ2_ZspkJXqIt2Zj-WG2BD_CitqxoC_PAQAvD_BwE) In addition, she's discussed how she wants to eliminate price gouging which has increased the cost of living which would improve everyone's quality of life.

My point is that these things are discussed, quite often in fact, and they're also available to see on her website. I'm not sure what else she needs to do to reach out to the voters as your saying. I guess she should just say ""I'm going to fix that"" like Trump is?"

4184,This campaign really is doing the hard work and I love them for it!
4185,"They need a way to reach the rural areas. Because Fox news isn't going to mention these things or any Sinclair station. My parents still live on a gravel road in BFE, while they aren't voting for Trump they complain that Harris doesn't have a platform. They never see it.

Edit: I need to clarify obviously, before someone else sends me a link to email my parents. My parents are anecdotal evidence. And I can't email them because their Internet connection works about 5% of the year since it's bounced off 2 different satellites receiver on neighboring farms to even get it that much. 


The point is. There is a lot of the country with no internet, and when when they do have it, they aren't going to seek it out.

But they can get fox news and they can get Sinclair owned stations and news papers, and guess who's using those means to reach people. It ain't the Dems. 


Harris needs to spread her info passively better. Mailers, News interviews down ballot needs to be out talking and canvassing."

4193,"Are you expecting them to release the text of Congressional bills?  White papers and one-pagers are much more normal to explain plans to the electorate vs. complex legalese and text of bills.

Just a few examples of shorter descriptions of what will obviously be very complex bills, exec orders and project plans.

>The Harris-Walz Administration will expand the Rural
Partners Network nationwide to all states and territories
by building on the pilot Rural Partners Network to help rural
communities access resources from the federal government right
in their communities. This will help entrepreneurs and economic
development projects identify and apply for federal funds.

They are going to expand the Rural Partners Network so people can apply for federal funds.  That is a policy even if it isn't the specific text and a thousand line project plan on how they will implement it.

>. Vice President Harris will work to re-capitalize and expand the groundbreaking
small business financing program, the State Small Business
Credit Initiative—which lifts up entrepreneurs and founders
in rural America and underserved communities—and increase
the capacity of lenders like Community Development Financial
Institutions to provide new financing to small businesses

Increase funding to SBCI and CCDFI for additional funding to entrepreneurs.  That's complicated so better to keep it simple here."

4196,"That's neat, but what happens to the rural areas that have no/unreliable Internet connection? 

Also people have to seek that out. It doesn't show up on newspapers they are reading to get the local news. 

There's a reason rural is red. GOP know how to spread their propaganda."
4197,"Thanks i saw that.  you got to admit its a bit light on plans.  more cheerleading  than anything else. 

not saying trump and gop has better ideas or plans just saying its kind of what i bitch about trump doing.  hot air and no real policly or proposals."
4198,"I also love letting liberals off the hook. Yay for trump lowering the bar lol /s

Kamala is pandering, as all politicians do. She is no different. Trump sucks. Kamala sucks."
4199,"I agree with you about the propaganda.  

This was from 2023. [Biden to fund more rural broadband](https://apnews.com/article/broadband-internet-access-federal-grants-cdcfb6f53b05107f0bfe02d5d366a39d)

4200,"Print it out and mail it to them, unless this comment isn’t about your parents specifically."

4203,"You clearly don’t understand how campaigns work. She will, when it’s time to make it happen after being elected, get with experts and pour over data to figure out the best way to do it. 

Give me ONE example of a plan Trump has detailed to that degree that isn’t just some tax thing (which are easy to detail and Harris has many of those). Like how the fuck does she get this much scrutiny on this when, unless you admit the horrible P2025 is Trump’s plan, Trump has even less concrete plans shared. He just has concepts of a plan…"
4204,"Great, go vote for RFK Jr. then for all I care. "
4205,"Ya, it's a great bill. But unfortunately it hasn't hit most places yet."
4206,"It's a generalization. Luckily my parents are pretty liberal, but all the farms surrounding them are not."
4207,"thanks. i know how to google.  the point was the headline is Harris campaign releases rural plans ahead of battleground barnstorm yet the article is very light on plans (there is link to one two page general idea but not really plans........

i guesse i am the only who sees a diff between plans and a rough outline or wish list.  its one of the things i cant stand about trump.  i got plans plans and plans yet its always short on any real detaisl,  its a wish list or basic outline."
4208,"you clearly dont understand my issue.  its more about the bs headline than her lack of substance in plans.  I do think she or the dnc are missing a chance to use tim walz and go more in depth on some more rural issues i bet he has a better grasp of and is able to convey better.  

Unles i admit?   uh look at my post history and see me hang 2025 on trump more than once.   you clearly got a reading problem"
4209,"I would, but just like Bernie… the Dems won’t let me."
4210,"The issues page is still fairly recent and I didn't know if you had seen it.  

Harris has accelerated this campaign from nothing to successful in record time without recklessly getting ahead of herself and without committing unforced errors. 

My read on her is she works hard but is a bit of a perfectionist.  So far every time people have complained that she isn't doing something, she does it a bit later than expected and has done a decent job.  

Trump is a lazy so and so who only has a concept of a plan for health care after nearly nine years of promises."
4211,"You’re a moron if you think the guy who endorsed Trump was actually going to be good for the environment, is a democrat, or is a worthwhile candidate at all."
4212,"wonderful     

now to my point again.   did you see the headline and the look at the article?  my point is the headline is about plans and the article is anything but that and the one link is just kind of wishes and dreams not actul detailed plans on anything.  i read it and took away there are not any real plans other than expanding some already in place program"
4213,"Ok.  Sorry I am unfortunately awake at 4 am 

I used to work in a news room.  Headlines are written by editors to gain clicks and have a loose relationship to the article.  But yes the journalist who wrote this article really exaggerated what is simply a noteworthy attempt by the campaign to reach people who other blue campaigns have written off. 

Hillary had plans on top of plans written up in detail and people thought she was annoyingly wonkish and measured the drapes for the white house before winning the election. 

I hope and expect that Harris and Walz will follow up this campaign promise with action if they win but whether it works, whether congress cooperates, whether they get it right, who knows.  

I do think walz is motivated to try to benefit towns like he grew up in but I am just reading tea leaves and making guestimates just like everyone else.  Trump is the guy with a clear record and pattern of behavior in office."
4214,"Looks like Politico is paying attention. The headline now says ""details rural push"" instead of ""releases rural plans"".

Also from the article:

> Harris has yet to release a full policy platform for rural communities, as some Democrats are pressing the campaign to do. Her campaign said the new document isn't a whole new policy plan for rural America, but is part of their aggressive rural organizing efforts.

Last week Harris hired Matt Hildreth from RuralOrganizing.org and I am hoping to hear a lot more about her rural push and plans."
4215,"> I do think walz is motivated to try to benefit towns like he grew up in 

thats kind of why i went to read the article.  Knowing walz is more rural i was thinking i was gonna read how they were gonna use him and his insight and what kind of plans they had come up with to reach more rural areas.  I was way off base."
4216,"Oh thank god it wasnt just me!


thanks."
4217,"Did you see Walz' interview with Ezra Klein?  It's on YouTube.  I'm hoping for more content like that.  

But that interview is not related to this announcement other than Walz being the same guy.  

Journalists are just spinning campaign horse race stories.  Sorry I misread you."

4223,It wasn't Kamala that motivated Taylor.  It was trump's using AI to claim that Taylor had endorsed him.  She realized that her values would be misrepresented and undermined if she allowed that lie to go unanswered.  Good for her.

4231,"Did Flint, MI ever get fully remediated?"
4232,">Today, September 6, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced the availability of $7.5 billion of Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) funding. The WIFIA program offers long-term loans to help communities implement critical water infrastructure projects, which protect public health, deliver environmental benefits, create over 60,000 good-paying jobs, protect waterways including drinking water sources, and support local economies, at a lower cost.  
...  
The WIFIA program provides its borrowers with creative, affordable financing options. It can fund the planning, design, and construction of a wide range of water infrastructure projects and offers the ability to combine multiple projects into a single loan. By streamlining the funding process, communities can accelerate their infrastructure projects. The WIFIA program offers interest rate resets, debt structuring, and fast disbursements, benefits not traditionally offered with other financing sources. For example, borrowers may defer repayment for up to five years following construction completion, and then customize their repayment schedule through the 35-year loan term. This flexibility provides borrowers with immediate funding to implement projects while helping to keep rates more affordable.

>This is the eighth round of funding available, and it includes $6.5 billion available through WIFIA and $1 billion available through the State Water Infrastructure Financing Authority, known as SWIFIA. EPA is accepting letters of interest for WIFIA and SWIFIA loans. To date, EPA’s WIFIA program has closed loans totaling more than $20 billion to help finance $44 billion in projects across the country. More than 100 borrowers nationwide are utilizing WIFIA loan to finance projects that benefit over 64 million Americans. Completed WIFIA-financed projects show positive health and environmental outcomes, as well as the advantages of financing with WIFIA loans. For example:

>* Orange County Water District (California) customers have a more drought-proof drinking water supply and are less reliant on imported water due to the completion of the Groundwater Replenishment System Expansion project. When interest rates lowered in 2020, the district was able to lower its interest rate, saving it an additional $75 million in financing costs.
* City of Wichita (Kansas) residents benefit from more reliable drinking water because of its new Northwest Water Treatment Facility. Due to WIFIA financing, the project was initiated seven years sooner than originally planned and now delivers clean drinking water to the community.
* City of Tacoma Sewer Utility (Washington) customers have a more reliable, resilient wastewater treatment system because of the completion of the Electrical Distribution System Replacement Project, which modernized the treatment plant’s electrical system. By deferring WIFIA loan repayment for four years after construction completion, the city can pay off existing state-revolving fund (SRF) loans prior to repaying their WIFIA loan. 

>The funding announcement demonstrates EPA’s continued commitment to water infrastructure improvements that ensure all communities have access to clean and safe drinking water. For this round of funding, EPA has identified the following priority areas:

>* Increasing investment in disadvantaged communities and improving health and livability.
* Making rapid progress on lead service line replacement.
* Addressing PFAS – known as “forever chemicals” – and emerging contaminants.
* Strengthening climate resilience in the water sector.
* Supporting water innovation and resilience.

>...

List of recipients for this latest round of funding can be found in a link towards the bottom of the press release. Statement from EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan:

>“Good infrastructure is the foundation for delivering clean, safe water to people across the country,” said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan. “The Biden-Harris administration has prioritized water infrastructure investment with this $7.5 billion infrastructure funding through WIFIA, on top of the unprecedented $50 billion in funding the Biden-Harris Administration secured under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. With these resources, communities will keep building on progress to replace lead pipes, cut PFAS pollution, and protect people from climate change.”"
4233,"The vast majority of Flint has had clean water since 2021, yes. However, the trust of the residents is something that will take a long time, if ever, to rebuild:

[Flint water crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis)

>As of July 16, 2021, 27,133 water service lines had been excavated and inspected, resulting in the replacement of 10,059 lead pipes.^[27] After $400 million in state and federal spending, Flint has secured a clean water source, distributed filters to all who want them, and laid modern, safe, copper pipes to nearly every home in the city. Politico declared that its water is ""just as good as any city's in Michigan."" However, a legacy of distrust remains, so residents often refuse to drink the tap water.^[28]"

4245,"The reason why Republicans attack celebrities so often is because they are afraid of exactly this kind of support rallied against them.

Celebrities, a good portion of them, are public figures that are ***usually*** more in-tuned with the average American than most Republicans.

They often come from poor or middle class backgrounds. They are, in some cases, quite nice people that do philanthropic stuff. They're more relatable than your JD Vances of the world. 

They often embody the American dream. The idea that you can reach for something you want to achieve, and then can make it if you work hard and have a bit of luck. 

It's why Republicans lash out and try to downplay celebrities so much. This is free press for Democrats. It's easy support for Democrats.

And it makes Republicans absolutely furious."

They aren’t the silent majority they think they are. No, the vast majority don’t believe you should be stuck in a marriage with an abusive spouse (I’m pretty even the most conservative forms of sharia law and pre-1950s divorce law allowed for it under that condition and infidelity). No, the vast majority of people aren’t worried it’s a buffet on our furry friends out there. Hell, while many may be personally opposed to gay marriage and abortion, it’s by far and away not the popular belief they should be outright banned."
4277,"Am I eligible yet for a child tax credit for my ‘alternative’ children that I fostered then adopted no less yet? And by alternative, I dually mean the types of pets that are traditionally overlooked (camels, pigs, mice, geckos). Justice for Gerbils!"
4278,The two sides of my personality both endorsing Kamala as childless cat ladies is really a nice moment for me
4279,She's smiling???
4280,"Childless cat lady is a Democrat, just as Vance said, more breaking news at 11"
4281,Here come the hotties endorsing Kamala nice 😊
4282,"It’s funny to see women with their cats and say I endorse Kamala Harris 

More than eight years ago, women wear cat hats after Trump said he took women by their pussies"
4283,Who
4284,[deleted]
4285,Well this is does it for me
4286,Every time I think this woman can't possibly get any more based she does something even cooler.
4287,Leslie Knope would be proud!
4288,And now Harris has the Wood Milk industry behind her
4289,Better this than the weird attack ad against plant based milk she made recently
4290,"Grumpy Cat is dead. 

***HEY EVERYONE. THIS GUYS A BIG PHONEY! A BIG FAT PHONEY!***"
4291,"More endorsements not bad, but this really isn't going to make a substantial difference.  Celebrity endorsements can matter, and Swift is one of the few where it really likely matters, with depending on one's estimate it plausibly adding somewhere between 20,000 and about 100,000 votes in swing states. Plaza's fans are a drop in the bucket compared to the Swifties. (This isn't a criticism of Plaza; she's clearly very talented.)"
4292,Whew. Now I know who to vote for.
4293,I fucking hate Aubrey plaza; more like Aubrey Gaza am I right??!??!
4294,Do these celebrity endorsements do anything? It’s preaching to the converted. For ordinary folk it’s a rich Hollywood actor lecturing you. Not sure it helps.
4295,"no worries, there are more than enough Kirk Cameron epics to keep them entertained for the forseeable future, amirite righties?"
4296,"Kevin Sorbo, Tim Allen, and Kirk Cameron in roles that will absolutely not surprise you.


In a secular world. Where Christians are constantly under attack. A group of cancelled heros decides that enough is enough. 


With Rob Schneider and Roseanne Barr.


The Chick-fil-A Network presents: The Deplorables.


(https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/chick-fil-a-cooking-up-new-family-friendly-video-streaming-service/)"
4297,"They already lock themselves out of so many videogames. Look at this [woke video game list.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1AVTZPJij5PQmlWAkYdDahBrxDiwqWMGsWEcEnpdKTa4/htmlview?pli=1)

Star Wars Battle Front is on there because if player accidentally kills themselves, it says “{player} kills themself” rather than “{player} kills himself”"
4298,"I had an online conversation with someone who said they are now throwing out all their Taylor Swift stuff since she's supporting Harris. I said, ""so you paid for the merchandise and are throwing it out, is that supposed to teach a lesson? You paid for it already guy"". Their response? ""Are you angry little guy?"" Like...you are a grown man throwing away merchandise while throwing a tantrum on a public forum, and thats the best retort? I don't expect much from Trump supporters, but their lack of awareness is just boggling."
4299,"My friend’s husband refused to watch *the Olympics* because of how “woke” it is. The fucking Olympics! Okay, just go ahead and miss out on the world’s biggest sporting event that everyone talked about nonstop for a month and only happens every 4 years."
4300,"Yeah, but this is so sad when it's someone you love. 

I have a close family member who has gone full Maga, and they won't watch, listen or talk about most things now. They're a completely different person from a few years ago. 

We shared a big love for scifi together, but I mentioned Mark Hamill a few months back and they went on a full out rant. It's sad."
4301,They get mad and cry about “disconnected billionaires & celebrities giving useless input in politics” and I’m just reading that dumbfounded at how close they are to being self-aware wolves.
4302,I think it's funny that all the MAGA cult follower celebrities are all D list has beens
4303,"They thought Colbert and Nick Offerman were conservative for a long time.


These people are not Smart "
4304,"Though I love to see them reap the consequences they have so frivolously sown, I'm not sure even greater isolation of these extremist nutjobs is going to be a long-term net benefit to society. It isn't like they stay isolated and just go away....they tend to get all stochastic after a while."
4305,"Just like I can no longer enjoy Kid Rock, Scott Baio or that guy that played Hercules in the 1990's.

Somehow, I still muddle through."
4306,Their safe place swiftly shirks down to an area smaller that a plaza.
4307,They’ll bury their faces in Tim Pool YouTube clips like one of my buddies from childhood.
4308,All these people watch are re runs of gunsmoke and Andy Griffith.
4309,"That’s exactly how my dad is, can’t watch anything with De Niro and the like without going on about political bullshit"
4310,"I noticed this type of anger at the TV happened to one of my friends during Obama’s 2nd term. I’d visit him to watch football or basketball games and he would start yelling at the TV during commercials anytime he’d see one with a majority of minorities or women. He’d be pissed as hell if they ever showed a gay couple. He’d rage at almost every movie trailer that had a woman or minority as a super hero or lead role. When the commercials ended he’d mumble on about “the jews” ruining everything.

It came to a head after Trump was elected and he basically laid all his hateful cards on the table. I told him we no longer shared the same values and had to move on from him as a friend."
4311,">They're not going to be able to watch movies or tv, listen to music, play video games, or anything, without getting mad at whoever is part of it.

Nah, they'll keep playing or watching, but spend hours on reddit posting vitriol"
4312,It’s going to come down to watching shitty Steven Seagal movies only.
4313,"They’ll always have Kevin Sorbo and Roseanne… you know, the cream of the Hollywood A-list."
4314,Sounds exhausting.
4315,"Weirdly, I can still watch *Videodrome* or *Lois & Clark* or *Hercules* with enjoyment. Of course, there’s nothing that any of the lead actors in those has done lately that is worth watching. It’s almost like the far right are too sensitive and are clinging to their archaic ideals over progress or acceptance or even the joy of connection with others."
4316,Hulk hogan and kid rock aren't good enough for them?
4317,I miss Grumpy.
4318,Not always. I used to really enjoy Hercules: The Legendary Journey :( Ah well at least we still have Xena. Was the better show anyway.
4319,Lol true
4320," It's kind of wild how much celebrity endorsements resonate with people. Some might scoff, but they can seriously mobilize certain demographics. Given people's emotional ties to these figures, it makes sense. Let's see if this cat endorsement trend genuinely influences voter turnout."
4321,"Sleep!

On fox news comments whenever google news takes me to their garbage site, you can see people in the comments complaining about football/everything. I stopped watching in 2016, followed by I stopped watching in 1986, then 1974 for reasons anywhere from kneeling to dancing celebrations. Think of how miserable they have to be to hate it when people express themselves and have fun. And they never quit, they are still commenting on an article about a 2024 week 1 game between arguably two of the worst 12 teams in the league…"
4322,"I think they’ll be okay, they’ve just been watching Sound of Freedom over and over again "
4323,"On my morning commute yesterday I could have sworn that one of the radio stations was playing nothing but Taylor Swift in response to her endorsement.  Not a huge fan of her music, but couldn't be happier about her endorsement and the trolling done by the local broadcast team."
4324,They still have all these classic James Woods and Scott Baio movies like....ummmm.....errr...
4325,And they just get angrier and angrier.  You 'Mericans need to solve the root cause of the problem.  Evangelical Christianity is destroying your country.
4326,The only thing being lost is respect for these “celebrities”.
4327,I want to see Dr. Evil do one…
4328,"[Linda Ronstadt](https://www.instagram.com/lindaronstadtmusic/p/C_zE5anv8UO/) has joined the party. [Stevie Nicks](https://www.instagram.com/p/C_yK-Bdv0mB/) did not endorse a particular candidate but did echo Swift's message to research the candidates and register to vote, and signed off as ""childless dog lady""."
4329,"If my cat could vote she would totally vote for Harris/Walz.  Luckily, her childless cat parents will be voting for them."
4330,It is karma - at the beginning there was pussy grabbing and that was just a locker talk
4331,My 22 lb. and very fluffy cat is locked in and ready.  He’s a good boy.
4332,Childless Cat people are united more than ever!
4333,Finally something to energize us millennials
4334,My cat is officially old enough to vote this year. She wholeheartedly supports Harris. She also wants her first  I voted sticker this year.
4335,Tell Trump Nugget sends his regards.
4336,"I've got nothing against cats personally, I mean some of my best friends are cats."
4337,Cats decide everything already.  MAGA made the mistake of being in their way.
4338,Not if “they” EAT THEM ALL!
4339,Finally!
4340,Trump cant win with these cats
4341,Republicans simply figured everyone hates women as much as they do.
4342,"I feel like there are more childless cat and dog owners today than ever before in history just because people are scraping by due to housing costs and minimum wage being shit and cannot commit to raising children, childless people we shall rise up and vote out these dumbass bullies"
4343,"> They have sown the wind, now they will reap the whirlwind.

I did not have Liberals quoting Hosea on my 2024 Bingo Card, but I am so here for it."
4344,"Republicans: Keep searching for: ""How do you delete something from the internet?"" And all that comes up is this image 

https://i.imgur.com/auHQKE5.jpeg"
4345,I guess they're gonna get hit by a cat 6 tornado.
4346,"I wonder if it is a bad idea, politically, to attack people more likely to have money and time on their hands?"
4347,Based Arthur Harris
4348,Being a cat lady just means that you are done tolerating toxic bullshit from anyone who isn't a fluffy little baby. A few scratches are fine. A few comments devaluing my humanity and intelligence? I'm over that shit 
4349,Don’t forget Kid Rock!
4350,"Every time I hear ""Scott Baio"", I have flashbacks to Can't Hardly Wait with Jenna Elfman in that angel stripper outfit, lol."
4351,Can I join as a childless cat dad?
4352,Vance picked the wrong enemy.
4353,[deleted]
4354,I would be pleasantly shocked. 🫢
4355,Waiting on Mahomes
4356,I want Mahomes to endorse her...and then see what happens in that household lol
4357,Also…just cause Wife Mahomes likes Trump doesn’t mean Husband Mahomes does…
4358,That man is a treasure.
4359,And yet two of the last four Republican Presidents were celebrities. 
4360,Aubrey Plaza was basically playing herself in Parks and Rec.
4361,Died in 2019.  This picture is from when they did the movie.
4362,Her inteligence will always make her attractive
4363,"I don’t follow politicians.  I’m voting for Harris and voting against trump.   
I’m not famous; I have kids and a dog."
4364,It is an old photo
4365,Obviously. Its almost like pictures survive
4366,It must be an old pic cause I'm pretty sure Grumpy Cat died a few years ago
4367,No mine!
4368,"If Dolly Parton endorsed Kamala, it would be even more epic."
4369,"I think it's more about voter turnout than changing people's minds. And Taylor Swift is probably a special case because she's so popular and many of her fans are very very big fans. Apparently over 300,000 people have already registered to vote through the link she shared last night."
4370,They can always listen to Stranglehold and the shitty version of Sweet Home Alabama while watching Charles in Charge.
4371,Somewhere out there [Hulk Hogan](https://youtu.be/lZcQZTOeSLc?si=vgMZpcYJ95vnX9-4) is tuning up his racism.
4372,You forgot Sensei Steven Seagal. He’s got delusional action with a side of cognitive dissonance on lock for MAGAts. 
4373,"you motherfucker.

Fireproof was my absolute favorite movie back in my Preacher days. I haven't thought about that clown in years."
4374,There's a new God's Not Dead movie hitting theaters this week. Which means they can do a double feature along with Reagan.
4375,"To be watched while enjoying God’s perfectly designed, totally not influenced by selective breeding fruit, the banana"
4376,Ha ha ha ! Good gawd mahn !
4377,I guess they can’t still watch those terrible hallmark movies lol
4378,Don’t forget about Kevin Sorbo.
4379,"Is he a MAGA guy, or just your run-of-the-mill Christian grifter? I know they can be one-in-the-same, but I hadn’t heard much about him since, well, since everyone else has."
4380,They can entertain themselves with all of the quality films that Kevin Sorbo stars in. I have included a full list of his masterpieces here:
4381,Chachi in Charge
4382,Chachi in Charge
4383,Kevin Sorbo has entered the chat
4384,Don't forget reruns of Hercules!
4385,"*look at this banana, perfect for the human hand*"
4386,Enough for a rapture-thon.
4387,"The Tim Allen one is the only one that makes me sad because growing up in the 90s, he *WAS* Santa Claus to me. The real Santa Claus would kick Trump’s ass."
4388,Tim Allen is still getting major Disney roles. Not sure why you felt the need to throw him in there compared to the other two.
4389,Soundtrack by Lee Greenwood and Kid Rock?
4390,"You joke, but I bet it’s more popular and successful than you’d think it would be. There tons of weird, hyper evangelical families out there that won’t watch or allow their children to watch tv or movies due to “satanic” and “demonic” messaging and imagery. Those people will all latch onto something like this, as it will probably be full biblical themed shows and movies. A kid I grew up with and went to church with couldn’t play with certain LEGO sets due to some of them having wizards and monsters. They couldn’t watch anything on TV (which was locked in their parents closet) without the parents watching it first and then comparing it to religious reviews that would get each month in some sort of weird christian newsletter. There multiple families like that at our church. And I grew up in a town of 2,000 people.

If they can get it off the ground, that streaming service will be successful."
4391,"Good god, that must be exhausting. 

Just enraged all day, every day, not truly sure why, and nowhere to put all that hate except down inside."
4392,"I like that this implies that all video game players identify as a male, as if Star Wars doesn't have some of the most famous Heroines that would draw players that identify as female."
4393,"That list is hilarious. Overcooked and it's iterations are listed as informational because you can play as a wheelchair bound raccoon.

It must be one hell of an existence that they occupy to feel their way of life is just under constant assault from all angles that they need to keep doing all this work to create safer and safer spaces for themselves to not be exposed to reality."
4394,The video game woke list is both nuts and hilarious. Imagine living your life this way? How exhausting!
4395,"That's the funniest fucking thing I've read all day.  God, what losers."
4396,"Funny enough they call Hogwarts Legacy woke, and they use the correct pronouns for Bridget Guilty Gear. Half of me wants to believe it's an elaborate troll, but they're contradictory anyway (and spending that much time and effort on a troll list is still kinda pathetic)"
4397,"That might be one of the dumbest fucking reasons to quit a game you like. What if the video game maker was just lazy and didn’t want to do both “himself/herself” ?


Also doesn’t it make grammatically sense to say “themself” than the other?"
4398,What if you're a droid
4399,Dark souls being on there is just... what?
4400,"They always ask ""are you angry???"" And it cracks me up."
4401,"> Are you angry little guy

It's always projection"
4402,It caused conservative outrage over the opening ceremony
4403,"The Olympics are woke tho, they have so many different people from different countries for ""diversity"" 


/s in case"
4404,Love when the camera cut to a beheaded figurine of Marie Antoinette.  Gojira just triggered all the conservatives in america.
4405,"It really is. 

I reconnected with one of my better friends after many years, only for him to just then be getting brainwashed, and to try and convince me the earth is flat. I tried to get him out of it, but he was already gone. 

Now he drives a huge truck, which he used to actively make fun of people for. The depth of the brainwash is startling"
4406,"Many look at a person, see the anger and hate and stop looking any deeper. I think that the hate may just be a symptom. Look deeper than that and you may find the underlying cause is *fear*.  

Fear of change. Fear of different, of the unknown. Fear of the perceived loss of power, prestige and money compared to the perception of others.  

Fear is *incredibly* powerful.  

There were some very strict deeply religious people in one nice, quiet area that believed they were living in the equivalent of a lawless war zone. It was hammered into them every day by their religious leaders to fear the world around them. So they lived in fear, despite living in a very quiet low crime area. It kept them locked into that religion. That was the only safe place where they would be protected. It also kept the donations coming in to their leaders...  

I think many people throughout the world can relate to what you and many other Americans are going through. You really are not alone.  

I'm in the UK. I had an uncle that actually ranted and raved about foreigners invading *his* village and destroying it. He once let slip that they were actually white British people, just like him.  

He also utterly loathed every sick and disabled person. We're all destroying his once great nation and for that we all needed to be harshly punished. He had memorised a long list of every sick and disabled person in his area that he wanted punishing.  

He would have voted for the first party that promised to deport all the sick and disabled people. He thought the sick and disabled were as bad as, if not worse, than all the foreigners.  

Yet he too was sick and disabled. He hadn't worked for decades. He had also lived in Europe for some time doing a job that any of the locals could have done.  

His life sucked. He was stuck at home in pain. His friends were growing old and dying. The village was growing and changing over the years. He was stuck at home with plenty of time to dwell on all that.  

He feared the changes, his life, the new people and the changing world around him. He wanted to turn back the clock and return to an idealised happy safe time that only existed in his dreams.  

The newspapers and politicians redirected his fears and bitter hatred away from them. They gave him a powerless vague group to blame. They gave him a name to pin all his problems on, much like a rally cry. *Foreigners*.  

We stopped visiting him as he would not talk about anything else. He was uncontrollably ranting and raving about all the imaginary foreigners invading his village. He was listing all the sick and disabled he so badly wanted to be punished. He *really* did want to hurt them.  

It's actually quite sad. Once he was a nice funny person. It was like he died. Gone was the uncle I once knew. My dad said that he had never seen his brother like that before. He was like a stranger. He'd lost his brother."
4407,What about Hulk Hogan?
4408,Really? Their safe place Taylor Swiftly shirks down to an area smaller than A. Plaza?
4409,Don’t besmirch Andy Griffith with that.
4410,"Hey now, all of my elderly liberal clients also love them some Grit!"
4411,Did you know Andy Griffith did an ad for Barack Obama?
4412,I see you knew my father. 
4413,"Gunsmoke and the Andy Griffith Show are awesome, though."
4414,Hey don't forget Rob Schneider
4415,"Mike Myers should do two: one as Doctor Evil with the cat, and one as The Cat in the Hat."
4416,I thought Cheney endorsed last week?
4417,"We do not gnaw on kitty. We stroke him, love him"
4418,Idk my cat is an evil little shit and might secretly be MAGA.
4419,"I think my cat would write in Dick Cheney. Love her, but she's an asshole."
4420,I feel like my cat is very anti-fascist unless the fascist in question is her and it’s 3 minutes past breakfast time.
4421,Same here.
4422,"My elderly lady cat would definitely support Harris, even though she would probably think she’s “a bit much”. My big orange doofus would 100% be a MAGA shithead. Not a single thought behind his beady little eyes, ruthlessly mean to the old lady cat, and completely dependent on the “government” for food and support but doesn’t want anyone else to get it"
4423,"I have three cats. I think I should get 3 extra votes, because they can't do it themselves.

We will ignore my cat status because it is unauthorized."
4424,karma is a cat purring in my lap
4425,May i join you with my pair of 20+lb Norwegian Forest cats? 
4426,"I am neither childless nor a lady, but I think anyone who sees me interact with my cats would say that I have childless cat lady enthusiasm"
4427,"lol exactly, they're so used to attacking women behind their backs, they didn't figure out it wouldn't be so easy face to face"
4428,"I was more so quoting Sir Arthur Harris who was quoting Hosea, so it's kind of a quoteception"
4429,Who?
4430,"Cats, dogs, what have you. All furry friend parents are welcome! Bonus points if you happen to be an immigrant of Haitian descent and, you know, aren't actively eating your pet."
4431,Yes
4432,"I already joined as a childful, catless dad. They’ll take literally anyone."
4433,If they come after Aubrey she'll scoop out their eyeballs with a melon baller and eat them.
4434,He also picked the wrong enema but that’s a whole other story.
4435,Harrison Butker won’t like it very much but fuck him
4436,A bunch of members of Kelces management team and agency have already come out in support of Taylor’s endorsement so I wouldn’t be surprised if Kelce says something in the coming days
4437,Mahomes did a press conference and said he doesn’t like telling people who to vote for and just likes to remind people to do their research before their decision and even said to make sure you’re registered. He’s always been like this. He’s fairly apolitical
4438,I wouldn't really lump Trump or Reagan in with the celebrities I am talking about. Talking like A-list celebrities.
4439,How insufferable
4440,Parton is probably on the very short list of endorsements that (like Swift) could have a real impact on an election.
4441,"Don’t forget the amazing cinematic masterpiece “Duece Bigalow:Male Gigalo”

/s"
4442,I think Perfect Strangers may also still be on the table.
4443,Gawd just set myself on fire. That sounds like an infinite nightmare.
4444,"Ronnie Van Zandt and the og skynyrd band were Dixiecrats campaigning for Jimmy Carter. 
 I reckon ole Ronnie is rollin over in his grave disappointed that his lil brother is a bootlicker to a scumbag NY conman."
4445,"Meanwhile in the multiverse Hulk Hogan is the worst Darth Vader ever. 

I’m your father, brother."
4446,"Hulk Hogan usually makes the wrong decisions on anything that doesn't involve wrestling.

He could have been the spokesperson for the George Foreman Grill

Hogan Knows Best (it led to his divorce amongst other things).

Choking out Belzer

Using the N word and getting recorded like the racist he is

His stupid beer and associated racism

Endorsing the wrong side of history

It just keeps going. 

I'm not even going to get into the time he turned on Macho Man Randy Savage, Sting and Lex Luger at Bash at the Beach 96."
4447,I read “out” as up and briefly thought he had died
4448,"NOOOO Steven Seagal is a trumper? Honestly I'm not surprised whatsoever, but that doesn't mean I'm not heartbroken."
4449,"What about Kevin Sorbo, TV's Hercules? That guy must be in all kinds of great projects!"
4450,"When I was a teenager I went to the movies with a girl I liked, for her birthday. I thought we were seeing Twilight. She pivoted to Fireproof at the ticket booth.   

Yeah, we didn’t happen after sitting through a two hour commercial for some pastor’s shitty marriage counseling book. "
4451,Hell they would throw a massive fit if the Dinotopia miniseries came out today
4452,"Not based on employment.     
Based on assholisity."
4453,"Tim Allen is still a great actor. I mean yea he was a drug trafficker, but that was forty years ago. "
4454,And Ariel Pink
4455,"Don't give them too much credit, they also take it out on service workers"
4456,"Agreed. What a miserable and awful way to live. In a way though I'm actually impressed that some of them can maintain that level of the rage for years, if not decades, without burning out and eventually giving up."
4457,"Some of them are pretty out there.

One of the reasons Starfield is on there is because it has an unrealistically diverse mix of people…. Even though it takes it place in 2330.

And Darkest Dungeon was on there because some of the strong frontline characters are women lol"
4458,"no see, there can be (a few) female star wars fans, but there can never be a female video game player, that's absolute sacrilege 

somehow"
4459,Now I kind of want to devote energy to getting every single video game listed. I am sure there is some tenuous rationale for pretty much anything.
4460,"What I like most about that one is that isn’t even a “woke” use of the “singular they”.

Like, if one of their friends said to them, “Last night, I saw this person in rain coat do the weirdest thing.” The people making this list very well may respond, “What? What did **they** do?” without realizing it.

Because that’s not woke. That’s just how you speak English when you don’t know the gender of the third party"
4461,"They also have Morrowind as a border case. 

They have other games that are woke because of anti-imperialist themes, which are definitely present in Morrowind, and also one of the major characters is a hermaphroditic, pansexual, all powerful god"
4462,"No no, it's fucking funny. Dark Souls is on that list due to ""subtly pro LGBTQ messaging"". Like...a god being ""born male"" but raised in a traditionally female role, and hence has feminine clothing. And there's a coffin that you can lie in that will change your character's body to its opposite, seemingly as a joke, as you can just swap it right back. 

Meanwhile Bioshock 2, a game that takes place in a broken, collapsing city meant as a warning against humanity's hubris, where you are a father-figure whose only purpose is to find and rescue your daughter, AND the cast is racially diverse, is...""non woke"". Ok guys whatever you say. Yall know it's fine to just say you enjoyed Bioshock 2. You don't have to pretend it isn't a dystopian narrative meant to critique the existing system."
4463,"If I see the... Hulk Hogan or the Donald Trump, I break their back - make them humble.

The Iron Sheik"
4464,Hulk Hogan was already known to be an a-hole before that Trump endorsement.
4465,/r/yourjokebutworse
4466,"I did not, but I am [delighted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOPf_UQRmuw)"
4467,"Mike Myers is Canadian, so, idk if he could really do that without causing problems."
4468,He’s Darth Vader 😝
4469,"That is possible.

But yeah, Halo and Tomb Raider, as well as their sequels were surprisingly absent.  I'm unsure if that's because something would result in the games being considered ""woke,"" and so they omitted them, or just somehow missed some *decades old* established IPs.


Horizon Forbidden West also oddly got a pass as ""informational"" despite an openly trans NPC quest, and an openly lesbian main character romance."

4552,takes about 2 weeks for the polls to move
4553,WHY is this race so narrow? Are there \*that\* many stupid men in this nation?
4554,This isn't much to go off of being that the poll was released on the morning of the 11th so to say it is after the debate is false.
4555,"> A new survey conducted by Red Eagle Politics as well as SoCal Strategies and On Point Politics shows that Harris is 3 points ahead of Trump, on 48 percent to his 45 percent. It questioned 719 likely voters nationally and had a margin of error of +/-3.7 percent."
4556,"I'm curious how Theil-boy Nate handles his predictions after post-debate polling starts rolling in.

Next week should be interesting."
4557,Least surprising headline.
4558,"No one is buying the mainstream media narrative anymore, well maybe most Democrats are, but intelligent people know these are made up polls. Trump absolutely brought policy and truth to the debate stage and Kamala just said ""I'm a woman, I'm black and that's all I need."" 

Inflation can't afford another 4 years of the Obama and Biden nonsense, if this does end up happening, we could see a stock market crash that's 10 times worse than the 2008 financial crisis. Normal Americans are not caring about identity politics and games, actual livelihoods and a future is at stake here and the Democrats will put this country into an additional $60 trillion or $80 trillion in debt.

See you all November 5th! I will be banned because this is a left centric sub reddit. Trump is going to win and serve his last term as president; You can all enjoy war criminal Dick Cheney's endorsement of your puppet candidate."
4559,"Yeah, I agree. The right wing pollsters are showing a +3 Harris advantage without the debate performance. There is a chance even these polls show a 4-5 point Harris advantage in the coming weeks."
4560,To many churches.
4561,A lot of stupid people period. White women have gone for Trump and are polling for Trump the last three elections. Propaganda and patriarchy is a powerful damn thing.
4562,"I’m just convinced the polls aren’t accounting for the excitement of Gen z, women, and black people have to vote for Harris. Maybe that’s cope but at least I realize lol"
4563,The cost of living is too high. People are panicking and seem to believe a dictator is a better option. They’re wrong but that’s a huge reason why it’s so narrow.
4564,"He's going to claim Kamala will have a post debate bump, therefore he needs to scale her down, and mark Trump as most likely to win."
4565,This comment right here is a cautionary tale for the rest of us! Rejecting facts and reason in favor of Russian pushed propaganda is likely to make you vomit your insecurities on the election in post form.
4566,"[Amazing, every word of what you just said was wrong.](https://youtu.be/2sRS1dwCotw?si=a9FT-AQE_PpAEdoC)"
4567,"> Trump absolutely brought policy and truth to the debate stage and Kamala just said ""I'm a woman, I'm black and that's all I need.""

Say you didn't watch the debate without saying you didn't watch the debate."
4568,What a weird rant.  I'm worried about you.  Screeds like yours can often be an indication of a carbon monoxide leak.
4569,what fucking debate did you watch.
4570,"> ""I'm a woman, I'm black and that's all I need.""

I think you're confused.  The only time Harris' race came up was when Trump said he read she wasn't black and then later read that she was black.

In Harris' response, she didn't even talk about her own race, she talked about Trump's constant need to divide the country over race.  The only person on that stage obsessed with race was Trump."
4571,">Trump absolutely brought policy and truth to the debate stage

Policy like ""I have a concept of a plan""? Or... actually, no. That's the closest he got to any policy, and even that wasn't really about it. The rest was all angry bluster and bullshit."
4572,"Nice to see a substantive comment that makes a clear statement, then cites credible sources to back up the statement. Of course I'm not talking about your comment, just that it's nice to see rational, well prepared comments elsewhere."
4573,When he arguing with the moderators about immigrants eating pets in Ohio because he “saw it on TV” was that him bringing policy or truth?
4574,Young voters are historically one of the lowest turnout groups.  There’s always a big asterisk every election *if we could get young voters to engage we’d kill it!
4575,"And after that it'll be because of the VP debate. And then maybe a second Prez debate or if that doesn't happen, an ""October surprise correction"".

I wonder what it'll be after the election (hoping Harris pulls this off, of course)."
4576,"Who sends AIPAC checks to your house? I would be more worried about Israel than Russia and China. Ukraine is a corrupt country and they're a huge liability like Taiwan. Ukraine and Taiwan are like Megadeath, just a cheap knockoff of Metallica. Ukraine is Russian territory, doesn't matter what western war criminals pump and dump into your brain. US wants Ukraine to join NATO so we can stuff nuclear installations on site to wipe Russia out in 2 minutes instead of 30 minutes."
4577,"Except the part about Dick Cheney being a war criminal. That part is true. 

But it goes to show that Trump is too extreme even for war criminals"
4578,"I make good money and know the value of money, unlike Democrats who think we can give infinite resources of mostly lazy migrants mooching off the system. The cool Democrats existed during the Bush administration, it's amazing how fast things can change."
4579,stay in school kids. this is a cautionary tale that can happen to you too.
4580,Cheney knows Kamala will serve his interests. Kamala will push for bombing Iran and expanding into conflicts with Taiwan.
4581,Being a weirdo makes money?
4582,But it was Biden who raised the minimum wage. He literally gave you a raise!
4583,"You resort to empty comments, I have yet to see any policy talk here. Democrats are now the pro war party and you could give a fuck less."
4584,"You have a poor understanding of inflation vs buying power. My 401k has significantly declined these past 4 years, under Trump I was stacking it high. Wages have not kept up with inflation in 30 years, but Trump balanced the budget out better."
4585,there’s nothing to say to someone as wrong as you are on every fundamental thing. detached from reality is not accurate since it would suggest that you were attached to reality at some point.
4586,If this is true then whoever is managing your 401k absolutely sucks. Market indexes are up like 30% since Biden took office. Did you invest your 401k in Trump Media or what?
4587,"> ...Trump balanced the budget out better.

This is an outrageously insane lie. Wow. Yeah, you're not debating in good faith *at all*. The facts are not on your side. 

The fact is, for anyone reading this who cares about facts, Trump inherited a stellar economy from Obama. He then tanked it, with both his utterly incompetent economic polices such as tax cuts for the insanely wealthy as well as ill-advised tariffs, and with his disastrous pandemic response. Biden thankfully has subsequently righted that ship."
4588,When you say 401K... is it like a bus route in your town? If you are talking about investment stuff you really don't need to worry about it. Probably not for a very long time.
4589,"what is your 401k in?  

* the NASDAQ is up 63% from 4 years ago
* SP500 is up 67%
* DJI is up 48%
* Total market indexes like VTSAX are up 47%

It would be nearly impossible to lose money over 4 year"
4590,"Maybe you need to reevaluate your 401k's management, mine has not been performing that way. I've got a 9% return so far just this year.

I have had to start having extra money taken out of my check to avoid owing the IRS, thanks to Trump's tax plan, though. Started owing despite no change in household income."
4591,"Bro, my 401k peaked at 97% back in 2018, during the prime years of the Trump administration."
4592,"It was four years of Trump's financial genius. I mean for fuck's sake, Obama had higher deficits than Bush. Obama hid most of the national debt in FDIC accounts for junk bonds and stock. Trump deficits have been lower than any president we have had in the 21srt century."
4593,the stock market has nothing to do with normal everyday people. You need to be in the 1 or %5 just to even have a chance of turning a profit on Wall Street.
4594,"Your 401k is bad, quit lying. You think it is booming when millions of migrants come in and the IRS waives their tax free income? You're deluded."
4595,Repeating lies does not make them true.
4596,Got some sources?
4597,"Those goalposts are moving faster than the stock market!

You said:

>401k has significantly declined these past 4 years

So were you lying? If you would lie about something so trivial why should anyone believe anything else you post?"
4598,The fuck are you on about? Can your brain not follow a thread. These are actual numbers. The Dow Jones was at 31k the day Biden took office. Today it’s at 40.3k.
4599,"actually, historically an influx of immigration helps economies."
4600,"Immigrants that want to be Americans, not people looking to take money and go back home. Also not immigrants that eat cats and dogs and leave trash in the street. Mexicans have proven to be hard working immigrants, can't say the same for Haitians."
4601,"You're repeating lies, again and again. Nothing else."
4602,"you clearly don’t actually want to have a productive conversation. there are very few immigrants who come to america to “take money and go back home”. I don’t even know how one could rebute that because it’s such an outlandish claim. Immigrants are not eating cats and dogs, that’s literally not happening lmfao. “mexicans have proven to be hard working” = “one of the good ones” mentality. 

just say you’re racist, my guy. 

Historically, immigrants in any capacity helps the economy, even if they aren’t paying taxes. I don’t know how to get that through your head, taxes are not the only way to stimulate an economy, far from it.

how do you feel about a measurable influx in violence against Haitians in Springfield since Vance and Trump spouted this lie? (yes, it’s a lie.) Because i’ll get you will make an excuse like “they are committing crimes and people are protecting themselves”"
4603,"Bro, I was pooping at work and reading your contributions to this thread and cracking up in the stall. I’m sharing this with my friends so they can laugh at you too."

4607,Man Leon is really speed running this villain thing.
4608,"Leon the Heinous...

>Also, yes, I saw ""the tweet"". Heinous incel nonsense is in fact heinous incel nonsense. I don't really have anything to add to it, it's just abhorrent. That much is obvious and if you don't see how then you're part of the problem. I would just like to say to my audience members, don't let people talk to you like that. It's disgusting, it's belittling and incredibly sexist. You deserve better."
4609,Honestly sounded like Elon was threatening to rape her
4610,"Slightly off-topic but isn’t it insane that someone like Musk, who up to a few years ago had a pretty decent public image and obviously shitloads of money, went this far right? Usually that move is reserved for washed up celebrities & other public figures trying to get one last payday or cling to relevance."
4611,This freak needs to be deported

Uppity billionaires need to be regulated out of existence on general principle, especially foreign ones meddling in our democracy."

4615,Lay off the ketamine Leon....
4616,"Musk is already too far gone but this is just a whole new level of pathetic and weird. 

Big head ass freak should be exiled to the Arctic or something, world would be a better place."
4617,Travis Kelce should offer to rattle Elon's cage since he just hit on his girlfriend by offering to put a baby in her.

4619,Elon gives rape vibes. He's a creep.
4620,"In the comics I was all ‘lex luthor is such a piece of shit…surely in the real world someone would have taken him out by now’, but here we are"
4621,It’s surprising to see someone so high-profile get publicly called out by their own child.
4622,"Elon wishes he could be with someone like Swift, but it would require him to be something his piles of money can never afford, that his influence and power can never give him: To be likable and pleasant.

Instead he has how many kids, how many child support payments, and the people in his life only give a shit about him because he is a Ceo and he signs the paychecks. Nobody cares about him unless they can have access to his money. And he knows this too, so he pushes away everyone on principle because they only tolerate him at the bare minimum. This includes his own family, kids, all of it. I mean ffs Hes begging trump, of all people, for attention. Thats how bottom of the barrel hes at right now. He has nothing except the little numbers under his twitter posts.

He has all the time and money in the world and all he can do all day is sit in solitude and post on twitter. And his lack of social grace shows; he really thought his r-pe cat lady tweet would be a home run hit, but its going viral for all the wrong reasons.

Anyone ever play ‘The Curse of Strahd’ from DnD? Im getting those kinds of vibes here"
4623,Swift needs to obtain a restraining order.
4624,"Remember this is the guy whose first thought about white men in Thailand was that they went there for sex tourism with underage children. 

Because that’s how racist billionaires think 

How can I get billions in government aid, or how can I get sexually serviced?

No one, and I mean no one matters to this person except as they can provide things to him. "
4625,So creepy. Dude must do a lot of coke to think that post was okay. Da fuq is he doing
4626,"I really want to wish he thought he was on a burner account…

BUT ITS STILL UP"
4627,He always goes for women who would be taken in by his $$$ so he has no clue how to react when he so desperately wants a woman who doesn't care and doesn't need the only thing he can provide. That's what happens when you not only live in an echo chamber but when you buy one.
4628,Leeeeooon
4629,Elon is just white Kanye
4630,"I’m convinced he has a “breeding”’or “pregnancy” fetish. Not sure what it’s called. 

Basically getting off on the fact you’re impregnating someone."

4633,lonE skuM
4634,The fact that this guy uses motherhood as a threat sort of tells you how he really feels about motherhood
4635,"The comment was intentionally posted soon after her endorsement post to take attention away from hers, overtake her on search engine/trending and ultimately to stop so many people viewing her message. It's also one of the main reasons twitter was purchased and why the extremely wealthy own media companies even when they aren't profitable. As weird as the guy is this was calculated."
4636,"Creepy as fuck. Weird. And nobody fucking asked, Elon."
4637,"I’ve told him this a thousand times…”Elon, never post high”."
4638,If he has any conviction he will say it right to her face. In front of Travis Kelce
4639,"Fucking billionaire attention seeker, so sad"
4640,"He's a Richie Rich kid just like his Orange Daddy Whorebucks. Elong Mulch is also a son of Apartheid. He believes in keeping the riff raff away from the Space Elite like himself. He is, by all objectives accounts, a steaming POS."
4641,Elon’s father has two kids with his former stepdaughter (who he’s known since she was 4). Elon is just trying to live up to his father’s level of weirdness. I think he might’ve surpassed him a while ago tbh.
4642,It really is disgusting. Major date rape vibes.

4649,"I told my girlfriend Leon said something really creepy, and asked she wanted to hear it, and then asked if she was sure because it was really really creepy, and then read the tweet and she was physically repulsed. 

It’s the grossest most tone deaf thing I’ve ever seen in writing from someone of his stature. It’s essentially like Harvey Weinstein writing “I’ll take you back to my hotel if you really want a job” 

Very, very, very brutally disgusting thing."

4653,I wouldn't be surprised if his part of a cult where they raped women.
4654,"At first I thought it was satire until more people said this is an actual post by Elon. 

Imo: more celebs need normal friends to help keep them grounded."
4655,"This dude is the richest man alive, can do anything he wants and decides to become a weird internet troll."
4656,"This is disgusting, but Idk why we give Elon such a big platform. This doesn't even fit politics, because he's not a politician. Just a creepy pervert who should be shunned by society."
4657,"How is the fact that he's a creepy weirdo a surprise to anyone.

The guy has had 12 kids (that are even known of) with fuck knows how many women.

He's a narccistic shithouse who thinks the world revolves around him, and that he's funny and charming so why wouldn't he think people would find him wonderful and hilarious for posting such drivel?"

4659,Maybe it was that specific daughter that he wanted to gift to Swift?
4660,What a turd.
4661,Maybe he meant he'd literally give her one of his many kids? 🤔
4662,Leon the Unprofessional
4663,"Leon Musk is an idiot to/for humanity, he is making humanity look worse just by perspiring and opening that decadent mouth he incoherently moves. The day the earth is not stepped on by this individual will be a happy day."
4664,"Holy shit, that post was *real?!* How could he think it would be OK to post something like that!?"
4665,Advocate is probably not the best name for a paper that has to qualify his daughter as trans.
4666,A trans daughter. This is great and almost never never fails to happen in the household of bigots. JD is next.
4667,Oh that’s the only place it’s going after that post... whoops
4668,"I say this with sincere apologies to Musk's daughter  


But I would expect a post like Elon Musk's to come from a 13-year old that is about to be expelled from middle school and/or spend time in juvie for sexual assault."
4669,"To be fair to Elon, I think he was offering to give her one of his 12 children because he has no love for them. Get your minds out of the gutter, folks. "
4670,What does her boyfriend say about this?
4671,This is rich clique gossip. I don’t give a shit about what these performative human corporations are saying about each other.
4672,"Wait, a daughter calling their dad an incel is paradoxical."

4675,"Elmo definitely gives off ""cover your drink around this guy"" vibes. 

He's really tanked his reputation over the past decade. Probably some sort of mid-life crisis that's spiraling into a true mental health issue. Wouldn't be surprised if he has jars of his own toenails."
4676,"He didn’t. He knew it was diminishing and demeaning. 

Let that sink in: He _knew_ the way to diminish this talented, rich and famous woman was to introduce the idea of her being inseminated by him. 

It’s an amazingly rapey, self-own. It’d be hilarious if it wasn’t so gross.

And he has every reason to believe his adherents hate women as much as he does.

Unrelated/yet totally related, how do we all think his child custody case is going?"
4677,"I think even when he's not using it, he's still stuck waist deep in the K hole."
4678,He’s such a gross creep
4679,Right? I always thought he was a fucking creep but  I didn’t have “impregnate Taylor Swift” on my bingo card. Wow.
4680,Some people just shouldn’t own social media
4681,"""Social/Moral acceptability"" is not a quality he evaluates before taking an action."
4682,"> Like, I dont know how far down the K-hole he had to be to think that posting that would socially/morally acceptable.

It’s because there will be no consequences. SpaceX will get more contracts; Tesla will likely get another round of EV credits by a bipartisan group likely led by dems; hell with Harris saying she would consider a Republican in her cabinet and secretary of Commerce tends to go to billionaires then he might even become that"
4683,"Untreated narcissism often gets worse with age. 

https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/lifetime-connections/202404/what-does-research-say-about-older-adult-narcissists"
4684,Musks entire personality is based on 15 year old racist edgelords on 4chan. It’s very obvious that he’s obsessed with early 2000s 4chan and similar communities and his entire online personality is based on that.
4685,Elon is just like Trump. Rich boy who has no consequences and therefore thinks it's fine to say the subtext out loud.
4686,More like just showing his true colours and not caring who sees it.
4687,"His mask slipped a bit.  He’s probably accustomed to gold diggers want his baby and it’s normalized behavior in his brain to a degree.  

The backlash will hurt him because it’s a reminder to him he’s only desired like that by some women because of his money.

If Taylor boycotts twitter that would be a emotionally painful blow to musks ego"
4688,I would expect a 13 year old to be more mature than that. How in heaven's name do you say something like that as an adult???
4689,"Delete your Twitter account if you have one, folks!"
4690,"He did travel to Epstein’s island and made a lot of calls to what’s her name, about martial arts or some bs."
4691,"Honestly agreed. He always came off as kinda scummy at least, but I legitimately felt like i was going to vomit seeing it"
4692,"I thought (somewhat naively) when he said ""give you a child"" he meant he would literally give her one of his 12 kids"
4693,I think we should call him Leon Skum.
4694,Is this the African migrant sexually harassing white American girls that the GOP is always on about?
4695,"""pedo guy"" was it for me. I was shocked, and it *instantly* changed how I saw Leon."
4696,Leon Skum* FTFY
4697,I’m loving how people are running with the whole “Leon” Musk thing.
4698,How long do you think it will take before he post some creepy AI generated pictures of Taylor Swift
4699,lol why everyone calling him Leon???
4700,He's been a low-key stalking swift on Twitter for a while now. She's never responded to him. This last tweet is over the top. She should finally reply to him with a copy of a restraining order against him.
4701," It's kind of wild to see how he's gone from being this visionary billionaire to this chaotic figure who just keeps stepping in it. I mean, there used to be a time when the name Musk brought up all sorts of positive associations, and now it’s just cringe. Maybe he just needs a break from social media and, like, some serious PR help, or not—who cares?"
4702,"I currently prefer Lone Skum for my anagram.



Edit:   But there’s also Ekon Slum"
4703,"Me too. I actually physically got an ick reading his tweet. What a gross, creepy, weirdo."
4704,I’m out of the loop on the Leon name
4705,Remember the black trench coat?  OG edgelord supreme.
4706,Leon Tesla. Friends with Tim Apple.
4707,"I mean in no world would that ever be consensual, so basically yeah."
4708,If this was done in work place this would definitely waranted a sexual harrasment suit
4709,I just assumed he was going to give her one of the 11(?) kids he has that he doesn't give a shit about.
4710,"People should just call him what he is, a sick fuck"
4711,Yes. That’s what we’re all talking about
4712,"~~Gary Busey~~ levels of swerve to crazy or Randy Quaid?

forgot about Gary's motorcycle accident / TBI. Randy was definitely radicalized tho"
4713,"He fired his PR team and now is aiming for elections, that explains it in a nutshell"
4714,"It feels like it's always due to either being credibly accused of sexual assault, or money "
4715,The creator of Minecraft did the same thing. 
4716,When has Elon Musk ever had a decent public image in his life?
4717,It would be funny to see him get deported back to South Africa and then be charged for all the crimes he and his family committed during the apartheid in South Africa
4718,"Definitely. As far as SpaceX, I think Shotwell is pretty much running that company. Leon just tweets out mission updates and obsesses over his Mars base (which will never happen until we can establish a moon base). If they can force him out on account of him being a massive national security risk, I think the company would do much better."
4719,"Twitter died the day he took over.  Let X burn, it will cost more in PR and life support than it would to start something from scratch.  The stink will never go away from it."
4720,"> Nationalize … Twitter

That would be doing him a favor. Thats been a money pit. Although its been cancelled out by Tesla investors and Vanguard giving him a huge bonus"
4721,I predict he'll eventually do a McAffee and go insane in some foreign country one day
4722,"The fact he ""jokingly"" commented about raping someone on top of it being revealed he may very well be a Russian asset makes him a threat to this country. America needs to take action and strip him not only of his property and resources, but arrest him for treason and lock him up or ban him from ever setting foot in America again."
4723,The weirdest thing is that if she wanted a baby wouldn't she just have it with her bf Kelce? What lol
4724,Musk doesn’t have any relationship with his children. He’s too busy running Tesla and X into the ground.
4725,He's weird about pronouns BECAUSE his daughter is Trans. She completely disowned him.
4726,"He said that ""wokeness killed my son"" in reference to her."
4727,"Hard to believe such a dork like Elon could have a cool as fuck daughter like Vivian. Definitely worth following on threads.

https://www.threads.net/@vivllainous"
4728,"He only wanted sons as an extension of self, cus he’s a sociopathic egomaniac. His trans kid threw him into some kind of mental spin as he got more and more addicted to ketamine, I’m sure."
4729,He deadnames her.
4730,"He has publicly said that his son was “infected and killed by the woke mind virus.” 

I’m not kidding."
4731,"Don't read too much into it. I'd be surprised if he has any strong feelings about his progeny, one way or the other. He is just producing more human beings, because in his incel mind, it's his duty. He doesn't really care for or generate an emotional response to his ""children."""
4732,"No, no, he needs more."
4733,Don’t do the Arctic like that. Polar bears are struggling as it is.
4734,Moscow ?
4735,Send him to Mars with one of his boring machines
4736,"The Arctic, while remote, is far from a land of exile. It's relatively populous, with some 4 million people living there.

He's clearly working on some space ark nonsense, I say we just expedite that and fire the sad-sack into the sun."
4737,Travis should try to impregnate Leon by snapping his big toe in his ass
4738,That’s the last thing any rational human would want to do.
4739,eww
4740,We Just gonna shit on Lex like that? Put some respek on the man’s name…
4741,"He's reported to do micro-dosed LSD nearly daily; otherwise, coke, pot & nootropics. He's always on some kind of drug."
4742,I think it matters here. The context is important because of his reaction to it.
4743,The Advocate has been THE American LGBT+ magazine since the 60s.
4744,"I would agree except the context is relevant here.

If Elon has embraced her and respected her, then we’d all be free to say daughter, but that’s not why her response is newsworthy."
4745,"Elon has proven time and time again he doesn't deserve benefit of the doubt. So there is no ""to be fair to elon""."
4746,"I'd say she's more attacking what he said with that line (since she called out ""the tweet"" specifically), which absolutely is something a little bitch incel would say."
4747,"Since several of Elbow's children are known to have been born through egg donation, surrogates & sperm donation, I question whether he likes sex with actual human women at all."
4748,"Most recent comment in history is ""most women would love to be impregnated by elon musk""



Please tell us more about ""credible judgement."""
4749,"What made you so full of hate toward people who are different from you?  She’s certainly more articulate than you are, why should we question her judgement, based on her gender?"
4750,"It's really kind of impressive how much self-inflicted damage he's brought upon himself, starting with his bizarre reaction to the Thai diver situation.

Before that, he was thought of quite highly by most people, and owning a Tesla was something of a status symbol on the left. He was one of the good ones, driving down the cost of the space economy while leading the charge at electrifying the auto sector.

How times have changed."
4751,He's a narcissist who wants his kids as extension of himself. He lost it when one of them came out as trans
4752,"I think he gives off “drink in a different location” vibes. A different continent, for preference."
4753,You are talking about a man who believes we live in a simulation AND that he is the center of the simulation.
4754,Let's not bring people who collect their own toenails into this. At least their hobby is harmless to society.
4755,I'm so sick of people saying that having jars of toenails is gross or weird! Maybe they're for crafts! Maybe people ingest them ground-up as a health supplement! Maybe they're for lots of things! Why do you care? I wish people could just mind their own business!
4756,"Listen here Jordan Peterson, you better leave Elmo alone, he's just a little guy, he doesn't mean any harm and he's not the embodiment of everything wrong with America"
4757,I have been feeling like all this is going to end with him in Vegas storing jars of piss in his apartment.
4758,He fired the person who was in charge of his PR when she wanted a raise and it's been downhill from there.
4759,I've been following Elon for a very long time now. I'm convinced he has a severe drug problem. His entire personality has changed including the way he speaks.
4760,"All he had to do was shut up and rice SpaceX all the way to Mars colonization and he could have gone down in the history books as a pioneer for the human race.


Instead, he's just made his life into a series of things somebody hates him for, and most of those things are pretty well justified."
4761,I mean they wouldn’t even let him into berghain 😂
4762,"Did he? Or was he just repeating a 8chan level joke 


I feel like you give him too much credit"
4763,"Probably, the whole point of it fighting depression and anxiety long term is that it's changing paths in your Brain.


I have very little doubt it can be overdone


Though he's also on track to be the first trillionare"
4764,"Somewhat of a required trait for a guy seemingly considering himself a template to be ""spread"" by having as much offspring as possible.

This sort of stuff was mentioned in our history classes..."
4765,"Yep, it slipped with the Thai cave rescue thing and him immediately connecting Thailand and raping kids, now it's him talking about raping a famous woman."
4766,I don't think he knows what real love is. Narcissist don't know what that is.
4767,"Nah Musk only has kids with his employees. Don’t want woman with the ability to reject me and still be financially independent /s

As if I couldn’t hate this guy any more, he becomes all the more detestable."
4768,*he's only desired by women brainwashed into his cult. FTFY
4769,Or...if Taylor launches a new social media app that emulates Twitter of the past and makes X obsolete
4770,He’d just sue her for not using his platform
4771,"He's going through the billionaire troll that owns a social media platform equivalent of what popular Twitch streamers go through: once you get that big following of sycophants it puts you in an echo chamber and you become utterly incapable of self-reflection. Not that the privileged billionaire thing didn't do that for him already, but it's magnified with his twitter use.

He can't even comprehend he could be a massive cringe loser/creep, and all the fellow losers who pile on to jerk him off help him hand-wave criticism from everyone else. And so the behavior just worsens and as you say, everything gets normalized to the point he doesn't think he has to hide anything at all or filter himself in any way."
4772,"I feel like if there were so many gold-diggers wanting his childr- I mean his money, he'd have a heck of a lot more children. For someone who has so much money and thinks it is his duty as a mega-rich superhuman to father as many children as possible, he doesn't seem to actually have that many children."
4773,I did that the minute he bought it.
4774,‘Kung-Fu lessons’!
4775,"Given how much he seems to care about money and how little he seems to care about his kids, he might consider it!"
4776,Omg I'm glad I wasn't the only one
4777,Their mom would care!
4778,That's perfect lol
4779,they’re eating the pets
4780,Elno. Rhymes with *Hell No*.
4781,Leon Must
4782,I saw Elmo Musk and I liked that one too.
4783,"Because Trump mispoke, he called Elon by ""Leon"""
4784,"That's DonOld's new name for him:

https://www.yahoo.com/news/donald-trump-mistakenly-calls-elon-200022622.html"
4785,"It's what his genius bestie, orangeman, called him in a speech last week."
4786,What do you mean? His name is Leon. CEO of Tesla. What’s not to know?
4787,"Given he owns Twitter, it kind-of was."
4788,I think 12
4789,Busey could at least blame the motorcycle accident TBI. idk about Quaid.
4790,I smell an iceberg chart....
4791,Being addicted to ketamine and Twitter also rots your brain a lot.
4792,"Funny how people used to suddenly find god when they were accused of doing some shady stuff, now it’s easier (and more profitable) to go crying to some right wing outlet whining about how you are actually the victim of a conspiracy"
4793,"Broadly speaking he wasn’t hugely unpopular around the time Tesla was breaking through. To clarify I’m not suggesting he ever wasn’t a piece of shit, just that his public image used to be generally more positive than it is now"
4794,Pretty much from when he bought into Tesla until he called the diver trying to rescue kids in Thailand a pedophile. Hell they even name dropped him in Star Trek Discovery because of his work promoting space travel and innovation. 
4795,"He had guest spots on The Simpsons and Rick & Morty, and a fairly decent amount of PR as a brilliant genius solving hard problems around electric vehicles and space travel.

Honestly, I realized he was a complete idiot and dipshit when he had that mini-sub built to ""save"" the youth soccer team caught in a flooded cave, and then called an actual expert in those sorts of rescues a pedophile because they dared question his genius."
4796,">As far as SpaceX, I think Shotwell is pretty much running that company.

I mean, maybe? She certainly is managing it day-to-day. However, it seems to me that Elon's misogynistic mindset has him putting women in charge of his companies (Robyn Denholm, Gwynne Shotwell, and now Linda Yaccario) because he feels like he can dominate them and neutralize them has threats to his power."
4797,She personally approved the $250k hush money payment to a flight attendant that Musk exposed himself to.
4798,He's from South Africa. He's currently doing the McAffee thing where he goes insane in a foreign country. Unfortunately we're that country
4799,"Her bf the handsome and sociable NFL player?  That’s crazy talk, who’d want a kid with someone like that?"
4800,and Grimes left him for someone who's trans too
4801,"lol, what a nutcase; wokeness comes and goes but families are forever, Musk."
4802,He clearly had no part in her upbringing
4803,"No, he deadnamed his trans daughter and said that “the woke mind virus killed my son.”

His transphobic hatred is directly tied to his daughter coming out."
4804,Right.  He's got 12 that we know about already.
4805,She did outright say he was a completely absent father.
4806,"I mean, the dude went on podcasts crying that his trans daughter (who he misgendered as his son) is dead, and all this anti-trans activism started after she came out.

We could say he doesn't care *for* his children, but he cares deeply, *so deeply*, that one of them had the nerve to make a major life choice he disagrees with and then reject him for not accepting her. Like all narcissists, that kind of thing cuts him down to his core."
4807,">feelings about his **progeny**



> in his incel mind


Incel is not the correct word here. How does an incel have 12 kids with like multiple women? Elon is many things (misogynist, chauvinist, probable rapist), but he is not an incel."
4808,But maybe he'd impregnate the polar bears and reverse their population loss?
4809,Bears gotta eat. Just send some Tumms along  too so they don't get sick.
4810,Refs would still look the other way
4811,you are correct sir :)
4812,"Yeah, Lex stole 40 cakes once.  That is not nice.  But its nothing compared to what Musk does."
4813,"Ketamine, not LSD. He’s fairly deep in the K-hole. And Desoxyn (d-methamphetamine) when he stays awake for days at a time.

But drugs don’t make you an asshole. He’s always been an asshole. Now he just broadcasts his assholiness."
4814,It also matters because he thinks he’s gods gift to the planet who needs to spread his seed as widely as possible but not connect to his progeny. So we need to know which kid is criticizing him.
4815,"She also isn't his only daughter, so it's a way of distinguishing. Although I'll also grant that his other daughter is only 4, so this being Vivian was implied"
4816,She is commenting on Musk's comment about Taylor Swift.  How does her gender have any impact on this at all?
4817,I know what the advocate is.
4818,You must have missed the part where I said he doesn’t love his children. 
4819,"I'm beginning to think his true life goal is to take the saying ""any publicity is good publicity"" and burn it to cinders so that no one utters it again for another millenium."
4820,He could have even kept up being a douche like this in private and just shut up on social media and he would have a shitload of fans. I don't know how Tesla can continue to function when he has made their product toxic to the population that cares about electric cars mostly through his douchery.
4821,Musk calling that one diver a ‘pedo guy’ started me on my journey towards my current opinion of him. At first I thought there must be some reason behind that comment but then — enlightenment found me.
4822,Marvel literally based a good chunk of Tony’s factories and stuff around him and even had a cringy scene in IM2 where Tony bumps into Musk. He was thought of so highly and then he went and became a lunatic. Someone should check him for brain worms.
4823,He was always an asshole according to his biographers. He just hid it better and/or wasn't addicted to drugs and attention yet.
4824,"Jeez, what a mental picture I now have of a pantry full of mason jars filled with…..toenail clippings. I did not expect my day to start with this. Well, and creepily, done?"
4825,"I remember reading an article in Wired about him as he was just coming up with Solar City. Man, it was such a good article and then when I started hearing his name more and more, I was genuinely excited as cuz here’s this tech billionaire who was legitimately trying to make better products for the sake of our future. 

Turns out he was just sheep in wolves clothing and became another rich boy fuckwad who’s only focused on himself…"
4826,"Hes literally becoming Vilos Cohaagen from Total recall! I know everyone hates chatgpt but i asked it to compare them and heres its response:

 Certainly! Here’s a summary of the comparisons between Vilos Cohaagen from Total Recall and Elon Musk’s real-life business ventures:

	1.	Mars Colonization and Space Exploration:
	•	Cohaagen controls Mars and exploits its resources for personal gain, suppressing access to life-sustaining resources (oxygen).
	•	Musk aims to colonize Mars through SpaceX, though his vision is centered on ensuring humanity’s survival and making life multiplanetary. He sees Mars as a future home for humans, similar to how Cohaagen governs Mars, though without the exploitation.
	2.	Monopolistic Control Over Resources:
	•	Cohaagen maintains control over Mars by monopolizing the planet’s air supply, using it to manipulate and oppress the population.
	•	Musk has a dominant influence in sectors like electric vehicles (Tesla), space infrastructure (SpaceX), and potentially energy (solar/batteries). While Musk’s ventures are positioned as progressive, some critics raise concerns about potential monopolistic power and over-centralization in these industries.
	3.	Tunneling Projects:
	•	Cohaagen digs tunnels beneath Mars, revealing an ancient alien reactor that could terraform the planet. He keeps this technology hidden to maintain his grip on power.
	•	Musk’s Boring Company digs tunnels on Earth to create underground transportation systems, aiming to solve urban congestion. Though focused on Earth rather than Mars, the large-scale underground infrastructure project draws parallels to Cohaagen’s operations beneath Mars.
	4.	Johnnycabs and Tesla’s Autonomous Vehicles:
	•	Johnnycabs are self-driving, AI-controlled taxis that transport people across Mars, replacing human drivers with automation.
	•	Tesla’s autonomous vehicles and robotaxi concept aim to create a fleet of self-driving cars, similarly replacing human drivers with AI-powered vehicles. This technological advancement is directly comparable to the Johnnycab concept from Total Recall.

These parallels highlight how modern technological advances and business ventures, particularly those of Elon Musk, can echo the futuristic and dystopian themes seen in Total Recall. While Musk’s intentions are centered around innovation and progress, certain aspects of his ventures—such as monopolistic control and automation—can draw comparisons to Cohaagen’s more authoritarian and exploitative methods in the film.


Im just joking around but its so fucking weird how similar they are 🤣🫠😛"
4827,"He lost it when she came out as trans because he told his wife that he would only have boys. 6 boys in a row wasn't an accident, it was by design."
4828,Unggue is a legitimate religion!
4829,You're all being very silly. We use them to build forts.
4830,I agree. He sounds like he's hopped up on Special K most of the time.
4831,So then I ask her “Do you like Thigh food?” Then I see if she corrects me or not.
4832,Oh….
4833,Was grimes his employee?
4834,He needs a power dynamic
4835,"Most women know Republicans are unfuckable; only losers could admire or desire Elon Musk.

He's hideous for one, then he opens his mouth and it gets even worse. "
4836,"Unfortunately as long as he has all that money he can’t be a loser creep in all social circles.  Only in the ones that don’t care for his money.  

Elon has a lot more sycophantic people in his orbit than a twitch streamer.  

So functionally he has a bunch of women that want his baby, a bunch of fake friends who pump his ego, a family who doesn’t like him, and the only remaining authentic things in his life are his businesses and his ego.   Add in drug abuse to cloud his mental health.  

Seems to be the formula of a megalomaniac billionaire whose only real purpose is boosting his businesses.  And aligning with the party that wants to be authoritarian he has a real possibility to become a billionaire lord with his own feif.  So from that angle I say do not underestimate him at all, he may be acting a fool, but he’s still got a laser focused will and enough intelligence/money to move the needle in trumps favor.  

If trump wins, Elon musk will gain a lot more power and influence.   And one thing he’s proven his talent in is building organizations like spacex and Tesla using government assistance.   His wet dream is to have no government restrictions on what he can do and even more subsidies 

Register to vote and do what you can to support Kamala"
4837,We don’t know how many he has but his official number of kids is high
4838,"The alternative is too repulsive, so I also thought that at first."
4839,"For me, *Apartheid Edison* is the winning moniker."
4840,lol great
4841,"lol, nice. Thank you."
4842,*stable genius
4843,No way! I missed that! Hilarious!
4844,"Y’know, Leon Tesla. Friends with Tim Apple."
4845,Teshla Moltars
4846,"11 living, 1 passed away. Though there are rumors he has more secret kids running around including Amber Heard’s daughter"
4847,"Yeah i had forgotten about that, now I feel i've punched down. :("
4848,Russell Brand did both.
4849,Exact same story for me. I firmly believe billionaires should be regulated out of existence but used to think there was a couple doing some good. The sub was the beginning of the end!
4850,"Good point! Definitely seems like he’d be threatened by a male CEO. And she doesn’t seem like a bag of shit in interviews but she is a cutthroat corporate exec who works for a misogynistic nazi…yeah, get rid of the whole gang and fold it into NASA."
4851,"Damn, I didn’t know that. Fuck the whole bunch of em."
4852,How culty is SpaceX?
4853,Little rich boy incel with paper-thin ego making disgusting comments at hot girl dating football star. What even is this high school bullshit.
4854,"He makes sure to use IVF to avoid having daughters, perhaps due to seeing daughters as weak and only having sons a sign of his power and masculinity. Her transitioning directly attacked his self image, causing him to voice his transphobic thoughts. He feels having a child that is t masculine destroys his masculinity. He is a weak narcissist."
4855,He has TWELVE kids?!?!
4856,"He does use IVF for a lot of the kids, but no he's not an incel in fact. Just in spirit. "
4857,"I see you're right. It's been mentioned in the NYT & New Yorker, as well as discussed on YC: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38052135](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38052135)"
4858,She's his only daughter besides the one that's literally an infant. The creepy fuck hates women and prunes all the female embryos when he does IVF.
4859,An additional little knife twist ?
4860,I meant it's okay to think the worst of the guy.
4861,Are you some sort of poet laureate? That’s outstanding!
4862,"Dude *had* a great PR team... And then, like many wealthy people I've dealt with, the wealth went straight to his head and he figures fuck it, he has enough fuck you money to do or say anything and did away with them and is unfiltered."
4863,"For me, it was Musk's appearance on the Big Bang Theory, and his reaction to the 2016 election that started me on my current opinion of him.  I also think he did or said something around that time that made me think, ""wow, Musk doesn't really care about climate change."" The Thai Cave Diving incident is what nailed that coffin shut.

A few years ago I would have said yes it's possible for Musk to rescue his reputation in my eyes, though I would have never expected him to do so. But then he bought Twitter, and buried that coffin in concrete."
4864,I feel like that was the tipping point for a lot of people. Who knew throwing a tantrum because someone helped people and your plan wasn't feasible would cause people to take a closer look...
4865,Don’t tell Elon about his kung fu lessons
4866,"One of the new Star Trek shows called him out by name as a space flight visionary.

I think it took mere months before it aged like milk.

Then again, the person who says this >!turned out to be a mirror universe psychopath!<.  \*Shrug\*"
4867,That’s the start of an awesome villain origin story.
4868,">Marvel literally based a good chunk of Tony’s factories and stuff around him [Musk] ....

Are you sure about that? Iron Man/Stark has been around since 1963."
4869,I didn't know that! Did his broodmares have abortions or is there some high-tech way of IVF that can be sex-specific?
4870,Meatball Ron with the weirdest dating tactic the world has ever seen
4871,I hate that I know about this. Ron cleaned up at the Weirdo Awards that year.
4872,She's his slave now.
4873,Honestly we gotta make sure no one fucks republicans anymore until they kinda die off since ideology is usually spread through the family unit. We just gotta survive the incel mass shooting wave that precedes their downfall.
4874,Greed is one of the seven deadliest sins for a reason.
4875,"Hindsight 20/20.

A lot of y’all were really into this guy a couple of years ago."
4876,except this is like the teacher talking shit to the students..because he's 20+years older than the two of them
4877,"At least, yes. All of them are IVF, which is strange all on its own. Almost like he doesn’t like having sex, at least not with women. IVF also allows him to make sure that only males are born. His one daughter is trans. IVF also happens to often result in twins, which is another reason he has so damn many."
4878,"Same as Nick Cannon, a Cannon of kids as it were."
4879,Gotta be honest with you… I want to maintain the indifference of not knowing any more about Leon than necessary.
4880,I was doing that when I suggested he would give his child away. Unless you think that’s actually fair lol but thanks for letting me know 
4881,"Thank you for the unexpected compliment, it warms my non-native speaker's heart as I was just trying to throw together a coherent sentence in English!"
4882,"> Dude had a great PR team... 

Then I suggest he thought ""Why am I listening to those guys? I'm way smarter than they are!"""
4883,Still waiting on you responding to being a simp asshole.
4884,"It’s been so long I’d forgotten that little detail. That actually redeems the line and makes it make perfect sense.

When he says that, everyone else is probably thinking, “Wait, who?”"
4885,"God that was cringe. Even when musk was generally well thought of. ""Do you want to end up amongst the ranks of people like [the guy who discovered relativity], [the guy who invented the warp drive] and [the guy who used his dotcom boom money to buy a car company]?"" Jesus wept"
4886,I’m talking about the movies. There’s a reason musk shows up in IM2. You can even find commentary videos online where RDJ talks about all that. My point is musk was seen as this genius philanthropist by everyone and then it turns out he’s an idiot and a creep. Go figure.
4887,The article I read didn't specify how it was done. I expect a little of both. I read the article a long time ago or I would link it. That is the only part of the article that stood out to me because making sure your 6 kids aren't girls is creepy af.
4888,"Yes, you can spin sperm in a centrifuge and separate x-bearing and y-bearing sperm."
4889,"IVF can definitely be sex specific. It's been a hot minute since I learned about the process, but I believe they can do a dna test on the embryo and that's how they can  scan for hereditary diseases and the sex of the possible future child."
4890,"X chromosome is bigger than the Y chromosome. So if you centrifuge your jizz, you can suck up the floaters with an improved chance of a Y chromosome. Or sex screen and abort post conception. I’m not an IVF specialist, but I did stay in a Holiday Inn last night."
4891,"it’s not even that high tech. you can have genetic screening done on the embryos to look for abnormalities. we did. that screening includes gender. from there, you could choose which embryo to implant."
4892,"I remain convinced he actually pronounced it ""Thigh food"" for a while and then got embarrassed when called out and *then* decided it was a ""test""."
4893,The likes of which have never been seen...
4894,"I also liked Kelly from the office.

""The new receptionist is also named Kelly.  So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk so that she can run into Charle's office every time he says Kelly.  She thinks that if she says 'you wanted me' enough he will in fact want her."""
4895,As soon as he changed political sides he was the devil
4896,"IVF because when he was married, he told his wife that he only wanted boys. I don't know what made him mellow with his other baby mamma's, but those first 6 boys were by design. That makes having a trans daughter that much worse for him. He paid for a son and feels cheated because he got a daughter."
4897,"He also has a naming problem.  X Æ A-XII Musk, Exa Dark Sideræl Musk, and Techno Mechanicus Musk."
4898,All except the first who died as a baby. He does have a few daughters but most are male
4899,Let's just shake hands and say fuck elon
4900,"To be fair, despite Musk being an absolute shitty human being, SpaceX has revitalized and revolutionized space access.

He was crucial to their foundation and success, but that dude having control of a rocket company is a national security risk on multiple fronts. I hope to god the government is tracking SpaceX's work carefully, and I hope even more hes forced to remove himself from their operations. I also wouldn't lose any sleep if they were nationalized."
4901,"The more I hear about him, the more I find him despicable human being. It's honestly incredible that such virulent misogynist and racist and borderline nazi could have held a facade of modern genius for so long. Especially since he grew up in segregated South Africa. This guy was featured in The Simpsons as one of Lisa's heroes, FFS."
4902,He probably just wants to make sure he doesn’t marry his daughter like his father did.  It runs in the family
4903,Science is nuts
4904,I suspect his sperm was already pretty dizzy.
4905,"Holy shit, I was going to ignorantly say theres no way they can do a dna test on an unimplanted embryo. Too few cells to start with, sequencing the few they get, etc, etc.

Turns out they absolutely can test 5 day old embryos, and its routine enough that they (can) test all of them in the current batch without impacting their viability. Absolutely nuts.

Back when we did IVF you could test a fetus pretty early- 6 weeks maybe?). It had a reasonable chance at miscarriage, and no reputable doctor was going to do it for gender reasons."
4906,Oh I don’t think he changed sides. I think he just hid his views and then one day he let the intrusive thoughts win and now here we are.
4907,The kids will fix that on their own later.
4908,"He's definitely leaning more and more into Nazi territory as time goes on. He's almost certainly a eugenicist, given his obsession with ""depopulation"" and his recent 4Chan inspired argument that only ""high T alpha males and aneurotypical people"" should be allowed to vote. He's absolutely out of his gourd. I wouldn't be shocked in he winds up as the next John Mcafee, at this rate."
4909," > facade of modern genius

I'm glad more people are talking about it. I've said for years, he's not half as smart as he wants people to think."
4910,He has admitted multiple times publicly that he has changed sides
4911,With a lot of therapy.
4912,"He brought back nazis to Twitter and props them up by responding to their deranged posts. He's straight up nazi.

I didn't think I'll ever see the day where I'm routinely getting Hitler apologia memes on my social media wall."
4913,He was always a libertarian so I don’t think he necessarily changed sides. Maybe he votes more to the right now because he doesn’t want to pay taxes and voters on the right are far more likely to be gullible enough to fall for BS that benefits him. Seems like he got super extra greedy and is willing to sell us all out.
4914,"From Apartheid South African to... American Republican..  to libertarian.. to MAGA? 


We're not talking about a Torrie becoming Labour becoming Lib Dem or whatever. He's literally an Apartheid wealth Baron."
4915,At least they might have the money for it
4916,"""might"" is right. Elon Musk is dumb enough to try to cryogenically freeze himself to live forever, or some other dumb sci-fi thing."

4918,">The second caveat is that, even if Harris did turn in the better performance, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the debate will give her a significant boost in the polls. In the CNN/SSRS poll, only 4 percent of debate watchers said the event changed their mind about whom they were voting for. An additional 14 percent said it made them reconsider but not change their mind, while a whopping 82 percent said it did not affect their choice.

I mean…4% changing their mind is absolutely huge in the context of the election"
4919,Even the Fox spin room acknowledged a victor afterwards. She walked him like a dog.
4920,"the amount of people mentioning they saw the pets being eaten on social media is insane. Russian bots are in full swing to convince people that this does happen.

TikTok algoritm is crazy to push propaganda to certain people. Once followed 5 minutes of Trump his speech on tiktok and suddenly got MAGA gabrage on my feed.

Don't assume all the 4% swing from Trump to Kamala. Some people will believe this garbage."
4921,lol.. no shit.
4922,"The Polls:

4923,A 6 year old could've told you that
4924,We needed a poll?
4925,4% changing their minds and 14% being moved some is pretty significant since that almost all has to be towards Harris.
4926,No shit.
4927,Loaves of bread have enough sentience to realise this.
4928,So did my eyes and ears.
4929,Do we really need polls to show who won the debate? 
4930,Why do polls on it? Maga will never doubt their brainless leader. The divide won’t be changing until he’s…..gone
4931,Anyone with more than two brain cells say that also
4932,31 percent of people in the YouGov poll don’t live in reality.
4933,Where the hell have you been? Duh!
4934,"That's a 8% win for Harris, assuming no Harris voter saw this and decided to switch to trump."
4935,Especially if it’s in a swing state right?
4936,"Just some quick math but with roughly 67 million people (probably more if you consider streaming) watching the debate that’s 2.7 million people who changed their mind. 

So yeah, that’s quite a substantial amount."
4937,"They are definitely doing their best to minimize the value of that 4% shift. That's like changing 50-50 to 54-46 or, to use the FiveThirtyEight average, 47-44.4 to 51-40.4. 

It's too much to be so hopeful that the end result would be a 11 point difference on election day, because the only poll that matters is the one you show up for and cast the ballot in. To echo the sentiments of everyone I've seen with a similar statement on Reddit, VOTE!\~

When elections come around in Canada, I tell as many people as possible to go vote. I don't care what their political affiliations are, their vote is the most important thing they have and refusing to use it is the dumbest possible move."
4938,4% is like RFK's entire support pre dropping out.
4939,"It could be important but we’re talking 4% of debate watchers. Not 4% of the voters. So a much smaller number. Then spread that out over the entire country, perhaps in states that don’t matter."
4940,"That's not a fucking caveat lol, 4% of the 63 million people who watched is easily enough to turn the election into a landslide for Harris in swing states. That debate could hardly have gone better."
4941,"There’s not too much you can take away from the poll, honestly. The margin of error is 5.3%, overall. But in the more specific demographic breakdowns that margin of error ranges from 6.5% to over 10%. 

For example, on the breakdown of who is changing their vote, 2% of Harris supporters said it made them change their vote vs 6% of Trump voters. But the margin for error for both those groups was 7.8% and 7.6% respectively. So the poll is basically telling us of those who watched the debate that anywhere between 0 and 9.8% of Harris supporters had their mind changed, and anywhere between 0 and 13.6% of Trump supporters changed their mind. And overall somewhere between 0 and 9.3% are changing their votes. Which is fairly useless data. Because anyone could easily and confidently say that any debate will lead to somewhere between 0 and 10% of voters changing their vote. It’s almost a certainty that assertion would be correct."
4942,At least she didn’t eat him.
4943,My exact thoughts when I read that headline. No polls needed here. We all witnessed it.
4944,The Trafalgar one is an outlier but don’t they have a reputation for being R leaning?
4945,"Trump could eat their pet on 5th Avenue and they would still vote for him, because they like his policies."
4946,It's entirely possible that there are people that fell directly onto their head while watching the debate.
4947,"Not all debate watchers will be registered voters, but it's still guaranteed to work out to a number in at least the hundreds of thousands.

So yeah, pretty ridiculous to put the word ""only"" in front of ""4% of debate watchers""."
4948,Exactly. And we don’t know which way they switched. 1/3 thought Trump won so say 1.3% go to Trump and 2.7 go to Harris that a net of 1.4% of the debate watchers. Which is nice but not a guarantee.
4949,"Yea, all these don't actually say that much about anything. Trafalgar is ranked 273 on 538 (republican leaning)."
4950,"Even if that’s true, that makes that poll in some ways more important, not less.  Especially since it’s the trend we need to see.  If the poll shows people switching you know it’s real.

Kind of like HuffPo telling me Trump did something stupid really doesn’t mean anything.  Fox News saying so does."
4951,"Trafalgar made news in 2016 by being really accurate, and touted that for 4 years then laid a massive egg in 2020 (they predicted Trump would win).  They are very proud to tout they find the hidden Trump votes which helped them in 2016 but screwed them over in 2020.  I assume they use the same methodology or similar so keep that in mind.  They very much assume there is a hidden Trump base not shown in other polls and take that into account.

I don't think they are super biased by nature but they do use some special sauce when dealing with Trump that gives him a bump in their polls."
4952,Concepts of policies.
4953,"There was a poll from Rasmussen (LOL Rasmussen) that showed Trump up by 1%.

In most polls, this would be meaningless. For Rasmussen, this is huge."
4954,"

4955,Even the guy who illegally authorized torture of detainees thinks Trump is too extreme and dangerous.
4956,"I forgot who I heard this analogy from, but as with Dick Cheney, Gonzalez isn't endorsing Harris because he agrees with her positions. He's doing it because Trump is a fucking rabid animal and Harris happens to be the one holding the tranquilizer gun."
4957,"So now we have both the Vice President and the Attorney General from the George W. Bush administration.

Weird."
4958,"I mean, fuck this guy, but just shows how bad Trump is."
4959,"Guys who've been around the block ALL see through Don the Con. Even republicans.

If you still think Don’s focus is the country’s greatness, I have a cheap Trump University doctorate to sell you. The only thing he cares about is himself. Always has!"
4960,I'm not surprised that a main-line republican pre-Trump would endorse his opponent.
4961,"Evil Republicans keep saying they think Trump is dangerous, doesn't that mean the party itself needs to get a little more moderate and not support the crazy guy who wants to be a dictator?"
4962,I remember that bastard. He sucks
4963,"The problem is that this doesn’t break the spell for MAGA supporters. We’re seeing endorsements from all across the political spectrum and instead of seeing that Donald
is that bad, they buy into the rhetoric that he is a “victim” being unfairly persecuted by the “establishment”. "
4964,This is another endorsement we could have done without. War criminals endorsing cam is really not a good look. Sorry to say.
4965,"Gonzales, Cheney, and Bush just want to get their entire cadre of war criminals and traitors moved down to #2 on the worst American traitors list."
4966,"Yes, Dick Cheney and Alberto Gonzales have always had Americas best interest at heart"
4967,"The most horrible members of the bush administration are all supporting your candidate, it must be because trump is horrible.

Edit: [Vote.org](http://Vote.org) says 300,000 new voters have ~~registered through~~ visited her link"
4978,"The likes aren’t the most important part, it’s the shares. This post has one of her highest number of shares, around 1.4 million (I think recently only her album announcement had more)."
4979,I popped on to see how many of my mutuals liked the post and my fucking boyfriend had liked the post. My bf is not a Taylor Swift fan. But he couldn’t resist the dog pile.
4980,2 million of those likes were within the first hour of her posting.
4981,I just love that’s it’s driving Trump even crazier than he already is
4982,Pretty ridiculous of how the GOP spends an inordinate amount of time removing voters from rolls or just making it more difficult to vote whereas the Democrats strive to register more voters and make it easier to vote.  Which party then is more patriotic then . . . I forget
4983,"She’s the most popular celebrity in the world. Her endorsement carries weight. It can only help. Thank you, Taylor, for doing what is right even if it was dangerous."
4984,"That's really good, but consider that this may not represent a lot of people who a) were not already planning to vote blue b) are old enough to vote c) are US based. I'm sure she will have garnered some new votes - some beats the hell out of none - but it's likely to represent only a fraction of that 9 million likes

4994,She's had registration booths at her shows for months now.
4995,"New votes are incredibly important. If even a small percentage of these are in battleground states, this was a great thing for her to do. There has been some back and forth about this, but personally I think her timing here is impeccable.

5004,"I doubt it will change many votes, but I might increase the excitement to vote, which is huge. At this point, Kamala needs to get the momentum going for another 8 weeks. Get Taylor Swift’s endorsement, appear on SNL, go on Hot Ones with Tim Walz. Anything to keep her in the spotlight and show how much different she is than Trump. Voters want someone normal so she needs to keep sharing that and keep people excited to vote. The biggest issue isn’t Republicans or independents, it’s the people that don’t care enough to vote"
5005,"I don’t think there’s any need to pour cold water on this. First, many of her fans are indeed of voting age. Second, young people typically vote in pathetic numbers. Summoning a legion of them with an enthusiastic endorsement, a reminder to register and encouragement to vote early is enormous. It won’t do anything crazy like double Harris’ support, but it absolutely will make a difference."
5006,"Taylor is 34 years old and has been in music since 2006. 18 years. Simple math tells you her supporters are more than old enough to vote. Most of her fans are in the 20's-30's demographic, but also go above and below. Are there some underage? Sure. But they are not the majority of her fans. She's a US born and based musician with immense name recognition. She's also been openly supporting the blue ticket for the last 3 election cycles. I dunno what you're trying to get at. You're making claims but you clearly didn't bother to research. 45% of her fans are millennial. 21% are Gen X. 25% are boomers. That means about half of her fans are her age, and about half of the others *are older than her.*

5007,Yes I’m hoping it translates into either actual new votes or causes some trump voters to stay home. I’d be curious about the actual impact it has….if any. Regardless just good for current media headlines I suppose!
5008,"Even if the 9 million were all votes, it is possible that the elections results would remain unchanged. 

And it is possible that just one vote could change who wins the election. 

Her tweet helped, for sure. 

We need more. We need to obliterate Trump at the voting booth. It can't be close. Every thing like this helps. We need to keep pushing. There are many states that will be red no matter what. 

The swing states will be key. Trump has powerful friends in key places. They will cheat. We can't become complacent. 

Every vote counts."
5009,When’s the Messi endorsement?!
5010,"Her instagram post included that, and links, and a suggestion to vote early."
5011,Because they’re salty and coping. Yesterday was not a good day for them
5012,Because they're brainwashed cultists who have been divorced from reality for nearly a decade.
5013,Who cares about that? Data about those who weren’t going to vote before due to general apathy but will now is much more relevant
5014,Aww someone hurt your feelings and made you spam the same post over and over. 
5015,"It’s more about **activating** voters. There could be a lot of her fans who already lean left/agree with the same policies, but for whatever reason don’t care about voting. 

If this gets them registered and to the booth, that’s great."
5016,Oh shit. For real? That’s is a strong move. Respect.
5017,She should do a free concert in PA for people who show proof of voter registration. Set it up next to ballot boxes
5018,I went to a Maren Morris concert last week and they were giving out cute glow in the dark pins just for checking your voter registration!
5019,Saw green day in philly about a month ago and they also had registration booths. They were giving out free American Idiot style pins to anyone who registered or proved they were.
5020,Even a few ten thousand registrations is above the margin that Biden won by in some swing states
5021,Or split it- go to Penn state as well. Dead center of the state. Stadium holds 110k and is the fourth largest one in the world.
5022,An appearance at a random small town rally would be fantastic.
5023,Oh no. Well…guess we know where they stand 🙄
5024,We love to see it
5025,Yep. It’s always a turnout game.
5026,If it wasnt going to make a difference MAGAts wouldn't be freaking out about it
5027,"Like I say, some beats none"
5028,"It’s been excellent for donations so that’s great and Kamala is sharing the wealth with downstream battles especially Montana, Texas, and Florida so the Swift endorsement does translate into big things just maybe not a 1:1 vote conversion."
5029,I agree. They’ll do anything to steal power.
5030,The walls of Mar-a-Lago were Messi last night.
5031,"Do not get your hopes up man. The dude lives in Trumpland Florida (bet he loves the tax breaks supported by right wing policies, dude never paid his taxes in Spain) he is Argentine (most racist Latin Americans), would also not doubt him loving Javier Milei. Yeah his endorsement might suprise you unfortunately."
5032,Is that what coping looks like?  New one on me!
5033,Exactly this. There are a lot of disenfranchised could-be voters out there. Getting them registered and interested in politics gives them a voice and in large enough voting blocks gives them power.
5034,"It's not, her last concert in the US was more than a year ago and since then she played in Mexico, South America, Asia and Europe. OP was probably thinking of other artists; I think Olivia Rodrigo is one example."
5035,"*If you’re good at something, never do it for free…”*"
5036,Turnouts have always helped democrats.
5037,I know i was just joking
5038,Even people on the MAGA reddit clone are in full cope mode. Trump managed to beat Biden for worst debate performance of all time. MAGAs watched Trump shit the bed all the way through to the floor for 100 whole minutes.
5039,"Yes, that is exactly what coping looks like."
5040,"Not all the time: but sometimes you can, if it benefits others. Not everything has to be about money all the time."
5041,Maybe this one time from democracy?
5042,Democracy isn't free though.
5043,Making the anti-billionaire class not resent you for being a billionaire is something.
5044,It's an investment into a better future
5045,freedom costs a buck o' five
5046,I spent 20 years in the military. I know.
5047,"I’ll never chide someone for being a billionaire. You won life, good for you. What I *will* chide people for is having the means to help and choose to hoard wealth instead."
5048,Isn't that the nature of being a billionaire tho? Hoarding enough until you reach the next zero in your net worth?
5049,You can’t stay rich without also being a tad selfish and greedy.
5050,Precisely.
5051,I don’t know. Maybe? I’m nowhere close to a billionaire so I have no idea.
5052,"Yes. They say there is a correlation between being grotesquely successful/wealthy and also being a sociopath / psychopath. Its usually a combination of fear, morality and an ingrained sense of justice/fairness that holds back most people from stepping on others to get what they want. Unfortunately, psychopathy is a true super power as they are utterly unencumbered by this. I want to point out too that being a psychopath doesn't mean you are a bad person. Many people realize they have some degree of this condition and choose to do something good with it, like become a surgeon."

5054,"> She could mobilize 1st-time and younger voters given her intense fandom, and she hails from a swing state"
5055,"Swift has millions of fans who'll do anything for her. Trump thought it was funny to use AI to falsely claim that Swift supported him.

These millions of fans are donating MILLIONS of $$$ b/c they want to show Swift their never-ending love and support for her. Trump poked the proverbial bear and now it's awake!

Trump has always been his own worst enemy. The Dems couldn't have a better ally than him."
5056,"By all means, MAGA, please keep slapping the Swiftie hornets' nest with a stick.


Fuck around with Swifties and find out..."
5057,Please tell me Harris retweeted her statement and then responded “I accept!”
5058,That’s so bizarre to me but bring it on!
5059,"My take: Swift’s endorsement is great and will move some people to vote

But…. the endorsement itself won’t move the needle significantly. Swift needs to reiterate her message repeatedly, if not campaign directly, for the most impact. Granted, Swift is under no obligation to do any of that.

Young people have historically low voting rates, and changing that will need more than one message posted to IG"
5060,They’re probably going to double down on their tone deaf idiocy and poke the bey hive next.

Please check your registration status at:

We are not going back!"

5064,"If they're mostly from Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Georgia that would be great."

5066,"She would blow this thing open with a free, broadcast on national tv, 'register to vote' concert"
5067,"She's the biggest influencer on the planet. She could have told everybody what she thinks they should do, but she didn't. She said, ""Here's what I'm doing. Do your homework and come to your own conclusion."" Much respect."
5068,Let's hope most of those people actually go and vote.
5069,How many of these visitors register to vote?
5070,"337,000….so far…"
5071,Yes! Ms. God has spoken!
5072,That’s sad. People should vote for who they think is the best person to represent them and their interest. They should read about the candidates and make their own minds up. Instead they are going off of what a celebrity does. 
5073,Made sure to confirm mine a month ago. It’s all set!
5074,"I check mine every so often just incase. 

Get registered. 

Make sure you're still registered!

Ask your friends and family if they are registered!

Be a voter!"
5075,I'm in NJ and still check my registration status every few weeks
5076,"Cringe, we know how to register. Youre on Reddit"
5077,"If you're in Texas, you have to print the form out and physically send it in. Better yet, physically take it to the voter registration office and personally hand it to the clerk. One might even want to take it one step further and ask them to enter your information into the system while you wait. Seriously, Paxton is working overtime to keep democrats from being able to vote in November."
5078,"Too fucking bad. There are millions of Texans who don't vote. If she can get 10% of them to register and vote blue, we're flipping Texas. I know it's a very low chance but one can dream!"
5079,Then they can gtfo. 49 stars is easier to put on the flag. 7x7 all day.
5080,It would be amazing. Remember we won GA by fewer than 12k votes. This endorsement and getting people to register (and hopefully actually show up to vote) could decide some of these states!
5081,Even if it’s just couple thousand from each battleground state that could easily be the margin for this election.
5082,Oh I like the way you think. They used to do these back in the 90 I think. Rock the vote?
5083,Free ticket with proof of first time registration.
5084,"Yeah. I don’t particularly care for her music or how frequently she uses her private jet, but I cannot deny she’s popular and advocated for critical thinking this election, which I’m always a fan of."
5085,I guess we’ll find out.
5086,"Read her endorsement. She literally tells people to do exactly that. Research the candidates and vote based on their values and interests. For her, it's Harris."
5087,This is so dumb it must be satire. All Taylor says is she is voting for Kamala and that you should do research and decide on your own but that you should vote.
5088,That is not what she said.  She encourages everyone to do their own research and vote what best fits them.  Don’t spread misinformation.
5089,Did you not read what she wrote?
5090,"> you have to print the form out and send it in

Jesus Christ, we should just give that state back."
5091,"Nah, we'll just replace them with Puerto Rico and/or DC anyway."

5095,"David Sedaris describes the dilemma:

A flight attendant tells her hungry passengers that they have a choice of two entrees for dinner, chicken or a pile of excrement laced with ground glass. A passenger raises his hand and asks, “How was the chicken prepared?”"
5096,"I somewhat wonder the question about some of these ""focus group"" people who claim she doesn't talk enough about policy/her positions. I say ""somewhat"" because, with as much as she very passionately harps on abortion and now helping people get homes, entrepreneurship and price gouging combined with being repeatedly asked about things like Israel and fracking...it's obvious she can't say anything to these people to get their vote. Especially if they're thinking of voting for Trump and all they have to say against her is they don't know enough about her/her positions. What do you know about Trump's positions from what he has actually said? ""Drill, baby, drill""?"
5097,"There is only one thing that I want from her. 


And that is to accept my apologies for being down on her when Biden stepped aside. I didn't think she had the recognition or the charisma. 


Never been happier to have been so wrong."
5098,Shes great. The media could start reporting on Trump like they did Biden after the debate. That would be cool.
5099,Undecided voters are the dumbest group of people this side of trump voters.
5100,"It's not Kamala vs Donald.  It's Kamala vs about a decade of propaganda spam.  The Trump she's fighting isn't real.  The Trump she's fighting isn't even there.  No, she's fighting a manufactured idea of Trump AND a manufactured idea of Democrats that have been marketed to a large swath of the gullible nation through media empires that have no ethical regulation or accountability.

Everything she does is solely an attempt to break down a decade of brainwashing.

This is why Trump can be the guy he is, act the way he does, and debate the way he did, and it's STILL a ""close race.""

It's not a campaign.  It's battling very real, very literal fucked up brains.

Worse yet, she can be absolutely EXCEPTIONAL, and it barely matters.

There is no fast fix to this.  Well, there is, but that adolescent kid missed on his fast fix.  It's also definitely not the way you want to martyr Trump.  You want him to fail spectacularly live, repeatedly, and fade away as a stain on this nation.  That takes time.

This is a battle of inches.  This is getting a few people, just a few, here and there to switch or at least become indifferent and not vote.  It's a slow, slow battle.

And yes, this seems insane.  That's because it is.  There is no normalcy to this, not at all.  There is no normalcy to the last 10 years of media.  Millions of Americans are now fucked in the head.  They're broken.  And they are very much going to stay that way for the rest of their lives.  That's the burden we face for letting media run without accountability towards professionalism, towards ethics, and no one holding anyone accountable.  We are now stuck with that mess.  Kamala is stuck with that mess.  Yes, it is incredibly insane, but...that's kind of what propaganda does.  It works.  It really works.  This is proof of when this kind of thing is systematically turn upon its own nation.  That's our burden to carry for decades.  And that's a burden Kamala needs to fight against, arduously, to gain just a few scant votes here and there.  But maybe, maybe they might be enough."
5101,I want her to beat that shit con man Donald Trump
5102,"I'm reminded of the joke about the Jewish mother who gives her son two ties for his birthday.  The following week he comes over to have dinner with her and is wearing one of the ties.  The mother says...""what's the matter, you didn't like the other one?"""
5103,"They want her to be male, white and mean. "
5104,"2 candidates on stage. One lead with their plan, the other lead with lying about people eating pets."
5105,"She didn't say that she'd dump considerable resources into developing keto pizza and ice cream that are indiscernible from the real thing.  Nor did she say that she'd dump $50 million into my personal retirement account.  So I'm not sure she really cares about my needs, honestly."
5106,"If America doesn't elect her over the wannabe facist boomer, then America is the problem."
5107,"I find it humorous and irritating, the media keeps asking “Where’s the beef?” at Harris.  The debates, especially with Trump, is not the venue to get all wonky and detailed because IT WILL BORE THE AUDIENCE.  She did enough for now."
5108,Seriously. This debate was the final test. Kamala Harris has not missed a step since she first started campaigning. From her first speech in Delaware to now every single move has been near perfect. Not one error. If this isn’t good enough for America I don’t know what could be.
5109,"Her whole campaign could be one sentence. "",My brain works"". And that ought to be sufficient."
5110,NO ONE is undecided…. They are just too chicken shit to admit that they are voting for a loser😆😂🙄🤣
5111,Women have to be everything all at once.
5112,A viable design for a perpetual motion machine might capture the interest of some independents.
5113,The media keeps treating Trump with soft loving arms that can do no wrong. Which is part of the reason we got here
5114,Apparently many want her to be white and male before they can consider her.
5115,"Federally legalize Marijuana . Not decriminalized, legalize."
5116,"I’m convinced that because people have been conditioned to believe she is a far leftist, they’re looking for far leftist policies. Since she hasn’t given a radical ‘Marxist’ policy, people are just still going “she hasn’t explained or shown us ANY POLICIES”."
5117,"White, male and over 70."
5118,"I think they want her to be a male, white, racist, misogynist, homophobe, ableist, anti-intellectual john and so on. His weaknesses are seen as strengths by far too many."
5119,To become President. And Roe reinstated plus fixing SCOTUS.
5120,Trump in Jail
5121,"Such bullshit at this point from undecided. On character alone
the orange turd should not even be there. The real question is how do they support the worse human race has to offer. Voting for Trump and the gop is voting against your own best interest."
5122,Will we ever really get progressive policies? Last progressive president Woodrow Wilson 1929. I just would like somebody to stand up to the corporations.
5123,"It’s crazy I just had a conversation at an outing and was asked about the debate. These ppl said yea Trump did so bad but I’m still voting for him, Kamala is just so dumb and I don’t like her. Like what?? Did you really even listen"
5124,"She exceeded my expectations. I was extremely nervous going into it because Trump loves the cameras with decades of experience speaking/bullshitting to viewing audiences of millions of people. Plus she has the pressure of actually wanting to be a good president and representing the country as a whole, not just a MAGA-like base.    


  But once Trump started taking the bait, you could tell she was having a good time. She had him in the palm of her hand. Dumbass just could not stop setting himself up to look rattled and defensive. Had he kept the calm and smooth demeanor of the first few minutes, it might have been closer to a 50/50 debate where no one would really move the needle."
5125,"I want her to make cigars $2.00 a piece, have a pecan pie shop on every corner, and give all Americans a “French fry Friday” once a month where we get off work early and eat French fries."
5126,"Yup. I don't know how anyone could be undecided at this point and say ""well, I still don't know her policies."" That's what her web site is for! The information you want is out there for the taking! And isn't it enough that she's not Trump?? 

I suspect people just can't bring themselves to vote for a woman, a POC, or both. And it's easier to say ""she lacks experience"" or ""she doesn't seem serious."" C'mon!"
5127,"Well, she could be a white man…"
5128,"I am voting for Kamala, but she needs to own up to our country taking a harder landing than this soft landing. Many people I know cannot afford to live life in a basic sense right now. And she should have addressed the CCP tariffs and not avoid hard questions. I know the public may seem to have the attention span of a gnat, but truth and transparency wins over voters in the long run."
5129,"She needs to be out there. Be in shows (daily show, Colbert, etc), do town halls, interviews, podcasts. And of course, continue with rallies, etc. it should be 1000% effort from now till Election Day"
5130,"I was reading one of those post debate interviews with undecided voters, I think it was the WaPo one, and the people there said Trump was stronger about the economy than Harris during the debate.

Did we watch the same debate? I couldn't even understand what he was rambling about, much less a coherent economic policy."
5131,I trust Kamala's choices to change her mind over Trumps failing mind.
5132,Her to win
5133,"Fox and the other right wing media would be wise to cut their losses betting on Trump, endorse Harris and hope that in four years they could find a sane gop candidate. I'm not holding my breath though, they are not that suicidal I guess."
5134,"Most of the moderates or liberals who oppose her are simply wrapped in brainwashing. 

She has no real positions or programs. Her program is, “I’m a liberal, sane grownup who’s loyal to the United States and will listen to experts.”

But, given who her opponent is, that should be enough."
5135,"I want a lot of things I know the Dems will never do. 


But I hate Trump more so I guess it doesn't matter. "
5136,Majority of those claiming to be undecided are just desperate for attention. They want to feel special and have people fawn over them.
5137,"They want her to be a man, not a person of color, and definitely trans/homophobic and for her to blame everything on immigrants, because after all it is all their fault that white people aren't all rich/S.  Seriously though at this point people have already decided who they are going to vote for, some people just haven't decided if either of them are who they want as president. It's baffling to me (as a Canadian) that Harris isn't expected to win in a landslide and that the senate and house aren't both going to be heavily won by Democrats, but ignorance and blind hatred is still driving too many people to vote against their own best interests."
5138,Im good beloved just waiting for my mail in ballot so I can do the fall out of a coconut tree challenge
5139,For her not to be Trump
5140,"8 years of productive, stable, boring governance would be nice."
5141,"The polls that make the race at 50/50, are manipulated? It should be closer to 62/38, for sure!!"
5142,"To answer the question in the headline, a concrete plan on achieving a ceasefire in Gaza or at least not having American weapons be used in a genocide.

To dive deeper in, I do ***not*** want, as point 2 describes Harris as, [""a centrist, Biden Democrat.""](https://i.redd.it/wlvmhd4ls1h41.png) Finally, the tagline of the article references Hamilton, which is just kind of cringe at this point."
5143,A change in policy towards Israel would help.
5144,Not being a Republican would be a nice start. It's truly mindblowing how far the Overton window has shifted. She's literally running a Republican platform and libs just open wide and gleefully swallow.
5145,This is exactly the situation we're in right now.
5146,"And, billions of dollars are spent to market the pile of excrement nationally as a somewhat weird but totally legitimate meal option, even if it does lead to massive internal hemhorraging. And chicken has bones. "
5147,Nail on the head
5148,"He’s so fucking awesome. I was lucky enough to see him at a reading several years ago. There was a huge thunderstorm and the power went out, so he read to the auditorium using a flashlight and no microphone.

The power eventually came back on, and after the event he did a meet and greet. Me and my at the time girlfriend were last in line, and because of the thunderstorm we decided to wait until it subsided before we walked home.

David Sedaris stayed with us for about 30 minutes, chatted with us, and insisted that we share his catered food with him because the venue had provided way more than he could eat. So we got to have an impromptu private dinner with this guy, one of my favorite authors, during a rain storm, in the hall of a beautiful auditorium.

One of my favorite memories."
5149,Nothing as incomprehensible as the undecided voter; they think they are special for their special questions.  I can’t stand them.
5150,“I need more information on Harris before I can decide.”
5151,Love him. Spot on.
5152,I heard that in his voice
5153,So you think people should just be content? Then how will things get better?
5154,"Honestly, after this debate if you're still saying ""I don't know enough about Kamala Harris"" I am just going to assume that's code for ""I don't want to vote for a woman."" It's basically the new ""there is just something about her I don't like...""

She's been doing rallies, her speech from the DNC, she's done radio interviews, and she has published her policy platform. There is no excuse for not being able to educate yourself on her at this point."
5155,"It’s definitely coded sexism and anti-Democrat sentiment. No one knows Trumps policies aside from Project 2025. But it doesn’t matter because he’s a man and a Republican so they overlook it because they assume he’s for the same things every Republican since Reagan has supported. Meanwhile, Harris makes her policy positions pretty damn clear and very clear if you’ve followed her at all since she won the nomination. Not to mention she’s basically running on a moderate platform compared to Trump’s far right platform. There really is no excuse for these voters."
5156,The former prosecutor vs a convicted felon/traitor always for sale to the highest bidder. What else do people need to make a decision?
5157,"What do you know about Trumps plan? Oh sorry, concepts for a plan"
5158,That's just the conservative media barrage right now. Those people are brainwashed. I hope they escape.
5159,"I know 2020 was a wildly different time, but I also remember that she was not at all charismatic in that primary. I think she's found her footing and gotten ridiculously more confident since then. I was also concerned about her prospects when Biden stepped aside, but less than a month later I found myself thinking ""oh shit we had another candidate as powerful as Obama this whole time, right under our noses?!""

Tl;dr strong agree with every vibe you're describing"
5160,Same. I was down on her for the first day or so after Biden dropped out and I said we should have an open primary. Then I heard her speak and I did a 180. I remembered her from 2020 but not super well and I was obviously sleeping on how much of a badass she is.
5161,"I was so pissed when I got the news. The Democrats barely avoided a Trump second term in 2020, and then apparently did nothing to prepare for 2024. It felt so rushed and weak to have Biden step down and I seriously thought that Harris wouldn't be able to recover from that. But man was I wrong. I had already been warming up to her, but she absolutely demolished Trump at the debate. I genuinely breathed a sigh of relief when I saw her bait him into rambling about his rallies."
5162,"Same, but my objections were logistics and financial,  with 90 days to the election I wouldn't think it would be possible to put together a national campaign and get the finances together to make a dent in Trump's lead, if anything that she did it makes it clear that she is an incredible executive and/or has several people loyal to her capable of such a feat, remember Trump has been running non stop for nine years. 

Kudos to the Democrats that didn't wasted time in internal squabbles but instead put their support behind her immediately."
5163,"With you.  Was super pissed the media and party big wigs made Biden step aside.   
Pretty delicious crow actually ;)"
5164,"I was never too skeptical about Harris herself, but I was definitely concerned that the ""she wasn't chosen in the primary"" / ""the Democratic Party is throwing out the will of the voters"" line of attack was going to have greater traction than has come to pass.  And I'm glad my concerns weren't warranted."
5165,She got mad rizz it’s brat summer no cap
5166,"The media is best served by a tight race up to election day, then Nov and Dec turmoil and chaos, and finally, a January coronation. 

It's all clicks, views, upvotes, and new subscribers. 

I'm afraid this integrity thing has mostly slipped away."
5167,I'm really hope last night marks the turn of the media finally realizing not only can they do that but they have to do that.
5168,"I feel like its very slowly…
Getting a little better.  Npr did a segment about sane washing.   Doesnt make up for it. But a start"
5169,Right? Trump doesn’t even know who won the 2020 election. I wish that the press would characterize that as cognitive decline or just plain stupidity
5170,"I came to the conclusion that since they are unwilling to listen or learn, they must simply be ignored and left to slowly rot away and die cold and alone, either that or quickly and efficiently removed.

It hurts my heart to say that, but sometimes you must amputate a limb to save the body. We need to amputate it now and within a couple of years. The way we do that is part making education better, part making sure MAGA is defanged. Idk how to defang them without speaking their language (Violence) but maybe Kamala does. 

These people are beyond saving, but our country is not."
5171,Well said
5172,A Concept of a Trump
5173,"And they’d still vote for the stupid, mean, orange male"
5174,They both lied like crazy. Kamala also avoided most questions as well. Kamala won the debate but neither did all that great 
5175,No universal pet insurance?? She lost my vote for sure  /s
5176,Exactly. “Undecided” voters are trump supporters who like trolling.
5177,"i sent this to someone who called her a Marxist today:

a far more compelling case can be made that trump is a Marxist:

1. said he'd be a dictator on day 1.
2. supports russia in the Ukraine war
3. wants to leave nato
4. supports book bans
5. incited and defended an insurrection. aka attempted to overthrow our democracy to stay in power.
6. has and will double down on replacing the government with loyalists
7. says he wants to weaponize the justice department against political enemies
8. attacks the press
9. wants to manipulate interest rates for political gain
10. literally gave away money during his presidency using checks that had his signature.
12. thinks the government should have a role in woman's healthcare 
13. thinks the government should decide who is allowed to get marred

conservatives are the embodiment of all their cataclysmic warnings about far left democrats

maduro would be proud!"
5178,That’s a really good point. “Where are the policies I can disagree with”
5179,"Exactly, for Trumpists policy = half-baked absolutes. Walls and bans are nice and concrete, while x numbers of dollars and to this and that require context and study."
5180,That has to be an act of congress. Both democrats and republicans are at fault for that. They have had 50 years to do something and neither have. 
5181,"
Neither presidential candidate will have any impact on Roe v Wade. 

Weird how people have no problem showing up to vote for marijuana legalization within their state, yet suddenly they whine about voting to legalize abortions within their state. 

It’s a state issue now. 

Whether you’re pro-life, or pro-choice, you have to vote for that **in your state** government.

Don’t like the laws in your state? Vote or Move to another state.

5187,Gotta give her lots of help in the congress. That's just the reality of how our government works.
5188,"Three types, needy for attention, stupid and oblivious, ashamed to be voting for Trump."
5189,"I get it, but this is from the Bulwark. I like that group, but understand that they want a centrist. They hate Trump, but they are still conservatives. And their current job is trying to convince other conservatives to vote for Kamala. That means they're going to lean into the centrism stuff and downplay anything that looks progressive."
5190,"But will you vote? That's the main question. 

Voting for a candidate is like catching a bus, instead of an Uber. It will get you close, but may not get you to your exact destination. But if you don't at least try to catch your closest bus, you will be left standing out in the rain. Or worse, picked up by some random crazy person who leaves you out in the woods where you have to eat squirrels to stay alive. 

Don't miss the bus by waiting for an Uber that's never showing up."
5191,"Sure, but your choice is between a centrist Biden democrat who will work towards a ceasefire

Or a guy who will give Isreal the green light to act without  any prohibitions.

Unless your real goal is to let the Israeli's wipe out the Palestinians, there is only one choice. 

On climate change you might argue that democrats won't do enough, and their half measures are worse economically than doing nothing, so might as well do nothing (still silly, but argueable).  However, on Palestine there is ONE alternative that is not horrible."
5192,"This isn’t going to be a foreign policy election. Or, rather, the fopo that matters is going to be “stopping Putin and saving Ukraine.” Gaza is way down on the list of things that people who are not extremely online care deeply about."
5193,A centrist Democrat is as far left as you're likely to get in the current environment here. Gaza is not of concern to most US voters. Those that are concerned are pro Israel.
5194,How should she achieve a ceasefire? Hamas turns down the offers and Israel turns down the counter offers. Even if they do manage to agree to one I doubt it’d last long

They think all of us that have decided are of low IQ—that they are better than everyone else, not realizing they are dumb as hell.  All these people take hours to choose between brown or black socks. They cannot decide what to pick from a menu at a restaurant or what shade of lipstick to buy. It is so irritating to watch them. When I see them talk, they look and sound ignorant."

I felt much the same way on all of this, but will add that in addition to 2020 being a wildly different time, the primaries really did not show her to advantage because she was competing against fellow Democrats rather than the actual enemy. Those other candidates would still be important and valuable allies no matter what the outcome, and distinguishing yourself in a crowded field of friends and colleagues takes a way different (and more delicate) approach than opposing the GOP.


So yeah: a lot of the strength she's now showing may have been there the whole time -- but now, thank goodness, she has no reason to hold back."
5208,"We did have an open primary.   She won it in 24 hours. 

I was one of the ones calling for an open primary because didn’t want a repeat of 2016, when the party elders anointed H. Clinton despite massive evidence that Sanders was onto something.   I could see them doing it again and souring the base again.  

Thankfully, the party elders didn’t impose their will.  Biden’s electors made the choice in record time.  Disaster averted."

5213,"> Idk how to defang them without speaking their language (Violence)


I don't have a full solution either, but here are two possibilities (though the second will take extraordinary effort and a bit of time):


1. Cut the far right capture of public institutions off at the source by actively challenging them in all these small local elections they keep winning, sometimes functionally unopposed. Everything happening now is enabled and worsened by all these ""patriots"" and ""concerned parents"" and other dupes / frauds fucking things up on the ground floor from their positions as county clerks or school board members or zoning committee members. The impact of these positions being filled by right wing extremists is already obvious, so consider what could be done when they're filled by people with integrity and real public spirit.


2. Colonize small states. There's probably a better word for this, but consider the comparatively miniscule populations of places like Wyoming and the two Dakotas. You still have freedom of movement in your country, yeah? A few million Democrats need to move to these states ASAP and start gentrifying. They don't count for a lot of electoral votes, and effective gerrymandering may still make it tough to pick up new Congressional seats there, but if you can shift the demographics enough to get those six senators (or even just most of them) turned blue you can functionally ensure that there will never be a GOP-controlled Senate ever again. The impact that could have on judicial appointments, cabinet confirmations, committee investigations, and many other things would be profound, and a step towards real checks and balances once again. I concede at once that this option is much easier described than achieved, as the people moving in will face considerable challenges and probably a distinct lack of options when it comes to employment and education, but maybe you can resurrect your pioneering spirit on this one in the name of the nation's good."
5214,Can I get a short list of things Kamala lied about? I watched the debate but if you could provide specific references to things she's lied about in the debate I would appreciate that.
5215,"Yeah that debate was going on in your head, bub. No one was invited to that one except you."
5216,Yeah no
5217,"I would say that accusing his enemies of being Marxists (as well as most of the things on your list) is another check in the column of him being a fascist. Although, I guess it's horseshoe theory at play."
5218,"So neither of you know what Marxism is, got it."
5219,"> It’s a state issue now.

It doesn't have to be. Knock this off."
5220,It’s like taking away the freedom of owning a gun and then asked to vote to get it back in your own state.
5221,"Trump simply cannot be believed that he will not sign a federal abortion ban. He will. He may feel personally different about abortions but he will sign a federal ban. 

Aside from that, extremist states are putting the lives of women at risk. In Idaho, OBGYN are leaving in droves because of fear of treating women properly and facing criminal charges. Life flights to Washington are increasing so pregnant women who are on the brink of death can be treated. This is not okay.

Aside from that, it's none of the states business what women do with their bodies. It should be between them and their doctors.

And you are incredibly naive if you think Republicans won't come after birth control next. They've already said they will.

That's what the abortion debate is really about.

And in my opinion even states like Idaho secretly don't want a national ban because their plan is to use liberal neighbor states to allow their women to get abortions and medical care while banning it in their own state to pretend to be on the right side of the issue.

But wait, there's more. Texas wants to violate medical privacy and stop Texans from traveling to other states to get medical care. And if they win on that issue they won't stop there.

Edit: re: voting to legalize abortion. I believe abortion rights have won in every state it's been on the ballot yet 20 states have total bans right now. Those states either don't have referendum or the state legislature has done everything in their power to stop the vote from getting on the ballot because they know they will lose. DeSantis literally sent police to petition signers homes to confirm they actually signed the petition because he knows he will lose on that issue. So many BS shenanigans from Republicans to keep people from voting it's gross."
5222,"I mean, I think she has plenty of concrete proposals in mind. She’s just trying to be the candidate for the coalition of the sane and loyal."

So gotta try and be a president for them as well and convince them you're on their side. It's like if democrats focus too much on identity politics, but not on class like working class, then the working class gets put off. Only marxist/leftists who are working class and understand class consciousness and rights for minorities will be on their side. It's unfortunate but this is the reality of the country."
5227,"*If* Harris outlines a plan to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza or not have U.S. weapons be used for genocide, I would agree with you completely. However, as the situation currently stands with both candidates poised to allow Israel to continue to operate with no red lines, I think the outcome in Gaza will be similar regardless of who wins in November."
5228,"It's an interesting juxtaposition that Ukraine is something worthy of caring about, but a genocide in Gaza is only something people ""extremely online"" care about. Why? Because Ukraine is white?

I hate to break it to you, but to the wider public Ukraine and Gaza are about equal in terms of importance. So if caring about one is ""extremely online,"" then so is caring about the other."
5229,"Anyone who is a single-issue voter on Israel is already voting Republican, while single-issue Palestine voters are a voting bloc the Democrats could easily capture if they made an effort."
5230,"I mean, let's be real, if the U.S. did threaten an arms embargo, Israel would accept any ceasefire deal that was put in front of them. We provide 15% of their defense budget and are vital in maintaining their national defense.

However, Harris has dismissed this possibility, so I'll leave it to *her* policy advisors to figure out an alternative."

I have more if you need them. Project 2025 is real. Its goal is to turn the United States into an extremist Christian nationalist homogenized ethnostate, entirely under the unitary control of a single individual. 

Supporting that plan is just about as anti-American as joining the south in the civil war, or being one of the Americans at the pro-nazi rallies of 1930s America."
5238,"This.  ^

In the 2020 primary Biden was the safe one and she was the smart one. That’s the takeaway."
5239,"2020 was an extremely crowded Democratic field, with a lot of very good candidates duking it out for the “lanes.” One can’t say we have a shallow bench."
5240,"That was a bold and strategic move for a senator just coming onto the national awareness. That primary catapulted her career by several steps, so it obviously worked and here we are. It’s an amazing story, IMO."
5241,"Great point. Really makes me wonder about the current primary system, given that it eventually led to the Biden/Trump rematch that nobody actually wanted. I know that our current primary system only dates back to 1968 or something, but I don't know much about the system in place before. But yeah, considering we essentially bypassed the primary and seemingly ended up with one of our best candidates in a generation, just makes you think."
5242,"It didn't hurt that all of the other main Dems who were being spoken of as possible contenders very quickly chose to endorse her instead.  Holding a lightning primary between only Kamala Harris, Dean Phillips, and Marianne Williamson would have been ridiculous.

Perhaps someday we'll find out whether those other Dem contenders were talking about the possibility in the weeks leading up to Biden dropping out, or whether they each made their own decision based on various factors.  I think it's easy enough to make a guess about why they decided to stand back for this election, and I'm not aware of anyone really pushing any conspiracy theories about it. But it really took the idea of an open primary off the table very quickly, which worked out in the end.

(I personally was of the mind that at least Kamala had been voted for in the primaries, as part of the ticket with Biden, and with the understanding on the part of the voters that they were okay with selecting her as Biden's replacement should something happen to him in a second term.)"

5247,"So if they don't outline it you don't vote. So in effect you are risking a Trump victory, which would put the Palestinians at even greater risk, as he has been clear in his support of an unconstrained Netanyahu. How does that help the Palestinian people? 

You can sit and feel morally superior because you didn't get exactly what you wanted, or you can do as much as you can to help move the needle toward a more peaceful outcome."
5248,"No, this is an obvious falsehood that means your real position is that you want Harris to attempt to meet your ever moving goalposts so that it alienates the maximum number of people possible.

We *know* Harris and the democrats position, it is that Isreal's actions against the Palestinians and the settlements are wrong, but we won't do something that limits Isreal's ability to defend itself from its hostile neighbors.

Now, I think the Isreali's have become a theocratic oligarchy, and am not happy we support that. However, unless one of Isreal's neighbors becomes radically more pro U.S., I don't see us changing."

5259,"The difference is that in 2016 our confidence was about ""theres no way he will win"" but noone liked Hillary. Now our confidence is about Kamala.

5261,"If the Harris campaign is unwilling to come up with a strategy to stop Israel, they are showing that they will continue the same ""no red lines"" policy as the Biden administration, at which point I don't think there will be a substantive material difference between Harris and Trump when it comes to Gaza."

Months ago it was a ceasefire *by* Election Day for Biden to receive my vote, now it's just ""Harris needs to have a plan outlined."" Seeing as the issue at hand is a U.S.-backed genocide, my position is *literally* asking for the bare minimum.

So you're not the voter I was describing... in the future I would recommend fully reading posts before making rebuttals.

> Do you think there are so many single issue pro-palestinian voters that will vote democratic instead of republican that it's worthwhile to customize policy to them?

""Uncommitted"" was the second place finisher in the primary, with enough votes in states like Michigan to virtually erase a potential Democrat lead. So yes."
5265,His plan is to have no real plan & have some bullshit thrown at us telling us to be grateful.
5266,"I imagine they’re happier than me for it.

I know I’d be happier if I spent the entire election cycle scrolling through cat pictures only checking on the candidates positions a week before the election and wondering why Trump is ranting about eating dogs."
5267,"Nope. Not married. 

My girlfriend is pretty cool tho. (And like you she’s from Ohio!)

And thank you! I probably get too much pleasure out of poking trolls who are incapable of admitting they are wrong, but it’s good practice for me to get my points down more concisely lmao"
5268,"Yeah; I was dreading the possible infighting, and lost time, and possible ""hurt feelings"" of that process interfering with the necessary work of making up for lost time in a now-shortened campaign.

I was also relieved that it seemed like all the VP candidates were mature about it, and understand they still need to work hard to get that ticket elected even if they weren't selected as VP."
5269,"Yes, this.  I was thinking more about Newsom and Whitmer, but this goes for anyone who might have thought about running in a truly open primary.  Sure, add Kelly, Beshear, Buttigieg, Shapiro, etc. too.

They all have every reason to want her to win, thus coalescing behind her quickly.  Because if Trump is elected, I'm really NOT sanguine about how free and open the 2028 elections will be.

Now, of course, if she wins, and there isn't a disaster of some kind, 2028 is \*probably\* off the table for any of them to really run.  (Despite what a lot of people were saying about ""we should have held a really open primary this time"", that would have gone against REALLY long-standing precedent of ""the incumbent is the presumptive nominee, unless he chooses not to run"". AND, it would have been an early signal of the Dems lacking faith in their own president, which frankly would not have been a good look, even if it was true.)

But most of them are pretty young, and 2032 is not the worst election for most of them to aim for. Most of the major contenders amongst the Dems are young enough that 2032 is perfectly doable.  (I just looked up Newsom; I didn't realize he was only 56. Good lord, he's my age. What have I been doing with my life?)

Buttigieg really needs to get elected to a federal office, and show some governing chops on a bigger stage.  Him moving to Michigan was a good move, as he wasn't going to become a rep or senator from Indiana, but he might in Michigan.  (Or, succeed Whitmer as governor?)

Newsom and Whitmer are both in their second terms as governor.  If they can't move into the Senate (depending on what seats are likely to be open or contestable at what times), then they could plausibly be given Secretary roles that would bolster their experience and set them up for a presidential run.  Shapiro is in his first term and can retain his position until 2030, if my math is correct.  (Or jump to a Senate seat if that comes open or makes sense.)

This speculation is just on top of the idea that Harris as VP was best-positioned to seamlessly slide into the Biden reelection effort, war-chest and all. And I think the idea that ""the VP is there to succeed the president, if necessary"" played into the acceptance of her doing that, albeit in the role of candidate.  

Otherwise, after being VP... in THEORY, she could at some point go for the Senate again, I guess.  The other big option would be a federal judge position (hell, even a SCOTUS position; the model there is Pres. Taft, who went on to be the chief justice of the SCOTUS after his presidency)."
5270,"Exactly.  We knew that when we voted in 2020.  We SUPER knew that when we were voting in the primary this spring.  The Dems were hearing concern from a lot of voters about Biden's age.  I don't recall anyone saying there was a groundswell amongst voters expressing concern that Kamala wasn't who we wanted to become president in the event Biden was reelected but had to step down (or god forbid, died in office).  

(Yes, there were some rumblings about ""gotta replace Kamala as VP in this round"", but I never felt like that gained much traction and I was never sure where that was coming from -- the pundits, other Dems, or voters.  Whereas, despite some people thinking that the concerns about Biden's age only turned up after the debate, and that it was only Dem leadership who then wanted him out, it was pretty clear that \*voters\* had been expressing concerns for quite a while before the debate.)"
5271,"I respectfully disagree with you on that point. Harris' position on Isreal is somewhat dictated by the fact that at the end of the day she is still the sitting Vice President, and will not publicly state a difference of position against the President.  If she wins, the handcuffs can come off and therein lies an opportunity for change. 

Trump on the other hand has shown us exactly who he is, telling Netanyahu to ""get your victory and get it over with."" You don't think he will give his buddy Ben anything he needs to accomplish that?

Eta : I think Harris has also shown more empathy to the Palestinian people than either her boss or Trump. That gives me hope."
5272,"Ok, that's more fair.  I have seen a lot of people who I think are little more than provacateurs that basically have wanted the U.S. to totally reverse course on our policies with Isreal."
5273,How many single issue voters are we talking about? I read the post and found it disingenuous. There are few actual single issue voters.Uncommitted doesn't say much. Did they disapprove of Biden's age? Does this mean they won't vote at all? Will they vote Trump? I don't buy that Gaza is a decisive issue in this election.
5274,Tell her I said hi from Cornhole Hell!!
5275,"I see the notion a lot that Biden is constraining Harris's position on Palestine, and to be frank I think that dog won't hunt.

I don't think that Biden, who was willing to drop re-election in order to give his party a better chance of winning, would be forcing Harris to keep votes on the table in crucial states like Michigan. If it was truly Biden constraining Harris, I think he would have opened his position up to the degree that Harris could outline a policy to win those voters.

But, hypothetically, if Biden is remaining hard-lined about funding genocide regardless of what would be best for the Harris campaign, why is that campaign behaving the way it is? Why would the campaign repeatedly and vigorously oppose an arms embargo, the most effective way to achieve a ceasefire, when they could just...not? If Biden was truly constraining Harris into following his Gaza policy when she wished to be less genocidal, why not give an open-ended non-answer to the arms embargo question (such as ""at this stage we're looking at a number of possibilities and will not be getting into specifics"") rather than a repeated rejection?"
5276,"Don't get me wrong, I'd love nothing more than for Israel to be treated as the rogue state it is, but I'm realistic on what is achievable."
5277,"I think current policy is also constrained by the actions of Iran. Due to so many previous missteps in foreign policy, Iran has become empowered and it's attacks on Israel in May are evidence of this. It's why they continue to support Hamas. If an arms embargo were to be put in place, Israel would be exposed not just to Hamas, but to Iran, and it's proxies in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. 

There's a reason mid-east foreign policy is a nightmare. However at the end of the day for me, even if both Harris and Trump did nothing, there are so many other domestic reasons I will never support Trump or his surrogates. 

Thanks for the chat."
5278,"First off, thanks for your inputs in this discussion. One thing I wanted to respond in your post:

> If an arms embargo were to be put in place, Israel would be exposed not just to Hamas, but to Iran, and it's proxies in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen.

If Israel is in direct violation of the Leahy Law (which according to Patrick Leahy who wrote the bill Israel has violated it), I’m not sure why that is our problem and not simply Israel’s. We have democratically decided that we will condition weapons sales and defense funds if the recipient is committing human rights violation. Why should we disregard our laws because Israel decided to disregard our conditions and put *themselves* at risk? Besides, I’m not in favor of completely cutting off Israel but I do want us to pursue banning offensive weaponry. I do believe Israeli’s have a right to live just as much as the Palestinians.

And this isn’t an unpopular move. There have been polls showing that at least 70% of Democrats support a permanent ceasefire. A May poll even showed that number being up to 83% for Democrats. Is there any other issues Democrats would not act on with that kind of approval? A Gallup poll from May showed that 72% of Democrats find changing genders morally acceptable and the D’s have no problem supporting and platforming trans rights with that level of support (which I am in support of). 

As for the overall uncommitted movement and undecided, I have a lot of mixed thoughts. I don’t think there are people under the illusion that somehow Trump would be better or buy into the notion that Trump was our most peaceful president (which is FALSE, Mehdi Hassan did a good short video on this). However, I can totally empathize with people who have seen and read countless stories and reports of civilians being slaughtered by the dozens, watched videos of children with blown off limbs bleeding out on the floor of hospitals because there are no more beds, seeing countless children who are now orphaned or parents who’ve lost all of their children. In fact, I don’t just empathize with them, I AM one of these people who have been following this genocide very closely.

I’m not sure if I would vote for Harris but my abstinence would be ceremonial (I’m in California). If I was in a swing state, I would most likely vote for Harris just to not have Trump in office. But it’s hard for me to urge these voters in good conscious to just suck it up and vote for Harris after all they have seen. To them, this is their “never again” moment and to be on the right side of history and not contribute to a system that is abetting a genocide.

Do I think Harris will be better about Gaza than Biden? I think so. Do I think Harris will do better than Trump on this? That’s not even a question. But we’ll see. Sorry for the long post."

5280,It was a single battle in the war to be decided on Nov 5th
5281,"2016 was about 80,000 votes across three states. Harris/Walz will not make the mistakes made by Clinton.

They have a since of urgency that this could be a close race. They want a landslide. Humiliate Petit Ego Orange. Felon. Rapist."
5282,"The obvious is not obvious to many Americans.  That CNN poll indicated that 37% of respondents thought Trump won the debate.  The guy could have walked out on stage, soiled himself and fallen over, and a big old chunk of the USA would have considered him the winner.

How can this near complete disassociation from the evidence ever be opposed?"
5283,Why is Kamala wearing Tim Pool’s beanie?
5284,"I do think dems are sleeping on the economic message.  

It’s been constantly ranked as the number one issue for voters and we saw how the “Actually everything is great! Stock market up!” line worked for Hillary in 2016. It really feels like the economic strategy is the same again in 2024. Touting Bidenomics and pointing again to the market when people living paycheck to paycheck simply don’t give a damn about the stock market.  

We saw how quickly they can turn things around when they identify a shortcoming and do something about it when Biden dropped out and everyone seamlessly transitioned to Harris as the nominee. I feel like there really should be a similar effort in economic messaging."
5285,[deleted]
5286,"Honestly, I didn't see a knockout. I saw Harris win by decision. She got Trump to say dumb things, and he looked annoyed at times, but that's par for the course with him. She scored more points, but she failed to put Trump on the mat.

That said... with all the kvetching that Trump is doing today, he's making it look like he took the beating of a lifetime. His performance after the debate is making him look like the biggest loser."
5287,[deleted]
5288,"“At the moment of victory, tighten the straps of your helmet.”

There will be many more battles after Nov. 5th. Trump will not go quietly, he'll try to steal another election. We must be ready."
5289,"It’s all going to come down to the GOTV effort. Kamala has momentum and resources on her side, but the GOP have the institutional advantage (massive voter roster purges in blue areas, threats of not certifying results, electoral map as well as favorably drawn districts, more favorable matchups in the Senate).

The GOP has bought in to the idea of taking this election by any means necessary, so I’m not going to breathe a sigh of relief until the day she’s sworn in."
5290,Don’t underestimate people making stupid choices
5291,"> The guy could have walked out on stage, soiled himself and fallen over

I mean, this is essentially what he did"
5292,"You want the answer?

Education!

Teach the public to think for itself and stop following the ideas of others. Make your own decisions and take responsibility for them."
5293,Because she stole it from him to complete her Rocky cosplay
5294,Tim Pool’s beanie finally got too ashamed to be seen with him.
5295,"I think that's why one of the first few policies formally espoused by Harris were the doubled child tax credit, the $25k bonus for first time home buyers toward their mortgage, and their plans (however realistic or unrealistic) to rein in price gouging by corporations that lead to prices soaring far higher than what inflation is"
5296,"They need to focus on any community who doesn't usually vote consistently, or at all."
5297,"Dude, she murdered him, plain and simple. She showed the whole world exactly how easy it was for *her* to get *him* to do exactly what *she* wanted, and he completely obeyed, over and over again."
5298,"As a high school teacher, I think you should probably go back to school...

Kamala killed it. She answered the questions calmly, succinctly and easily manipulated and called out her opponent and showed the country what a pathetic loser he really is.

Seriously you must be in denial or living in an alternate reality if you don't think one did **significantly** better than the other"

He self immolated, if this isn’t covered constantly the way Biden’s disastrous performance was, then the media is just catering to the delicate feelings of Trump supporters"
5347,I still don't get the line on she has few facts. She was all facts. Trump voters are starting to grasp that they have the wrong horse and are starting their stages of grief.
5348,"The coverage on Fox News has been insane since the debate.

The propaganda they are spewing is on a different level than I've seen from them before. They aren't discussing any of the negative moments; e.g, him bragging about Roe v Wade, claiming the 2020 election was stolen, or him not expressing support for Ukraine to win the war."
5349,"People are not talking about the ""I have a concept of a plan"" moment enough. How do you hear something like that and still think this guy should be your leader?"
5350,"CNN had yet again another Trumper in their ""undecided"" voter pool."
5351,You could almost say Trump didn't  have a concept of a plan on how to debate Harris!!
5352,"People are increasingly realizing that the far-right Republicans are just doing the bidding of big corporations, often at the expense of ordinary people and the world around us. 
Go Kamala 🌊❤️🤍💙🌊🇺🇸🫶🙌🌊"
5353,I wonder if Republicans are now going to be calling for him to do the right thing and step down like Biden.  He’s clearly a detriment to the election hopes.
5354,You know that it went really well for Harris when even Fox News's stacked panel thought she won.
5355,"Hey Rupert you shriveled old grape. The writing’s on the wall. You better do what you’ve always done, pivot to a winner or expect Fox News to die a slow excruciating death when your core audience dies off."
5356,"I got annoyed when Trump talked about immigration for the 4th time because by that point it was boring and proved Harris point he would talk about it even when it wasn't relevant.  




He continued to do it 2 more times.  






I was wondering if actual conservatives found the repetition offputting so I feel vindicated after reading that article. "
5357,The early hours of the morning posts are going to be EPIC tomorrow.
5358,"That ding dong of a panelist is an idiot. ""Kamala says she wants to do all these executive orders, why doesn't she do them now"" The VP can't do executive orders dumbass"
5359,Kamala destroyed the convicted criminal and made him fart like a cow. Well done Kamala. You won the vote of Taylor.
5360,"TBF, this year’s Chicago White Sox could have beaten Trump tonight."
5361,"I really liked seeing that intense “big cat on the hunt” look in her eyes when she got him to self immolate.  I also liked the way she casually escaped Trump’s rhetorical traps and flipped them into dominance positions for her. She’s no sleepy herbivore.

I am now totally comfortable with her representing us on the geopolitical stage.  I hadn’t seen that side of her before."
5362,"The thing is will it make any difference?

Had she performed badly possibly, I think all it did was consolidate people's choices.

The election will be decided by a few thousand people, most probably in Pennsylvania"
5363,"That was hard to watch. 

""Kamala had no specifics to her plans...."" While Trump is running on concepts of ideas. Give me a break. 

""Transgender Operations on Illegal Aliens in Prison"" and “eating the dogs…they’re eating the cats”... are you kidding me right now? What the hell is wrong with these stupid people?"
5364,This is great news - shows  that the GOP stranglehold is beginning to crumble... but man do I feel dirty clicking that link...
5365,Five of seventeen people in their watch group thought Trump won is the real news. WTF were they watching?
5366,"I saw an article with 25 “undecided” voters. The two that still supported after the debate claim it’s because Harris didn’t clarify any of her positions. Meanwhile, Trump said he has the concept of a plan and they’re acting like he’s a genius. Gullible isn’t a strong enough word for these idiots."
5367,Well I'm glad even them were able to see the truth
5368,"She didn’t win the debate – she kicked his sorry ass all around that room
Trump was clearly wildly unprepared for the debate and thought he could get away with basically treating it like another unchecked lying fest that his rallies are– it must’ve been a cold streak of fear that ran through him when he realized ABC News was going to factcheck him on the spot"
5369,"I lost bigly. Everybody is saying it. Even Fox News is saying it. Billions of people are telling me “Sir, you lost bigly!”"
5370,"Watch the video of the panel being interviewed to get a sense of how dumb the average voter is.  One of the people thinks Biden and Harris haven't done anything in the last 3.5 years.  He has no idea that they signed many massive bills like the infrastructure bill, the clean energy bill, the chips and sciences act, etc.  Absolutely no clue.  Another voter was still confused about Harris' race.  It seems some people really have a hard time understanding that she is biracial.  They can't comprehend that a person can be of mixed race."
5371,"“With President Joe Biden and her at the helm, nothing has happened. All these executive orders, nothing. You’re telling me she has to wait until January 20th to do something?”

Yes, that’s exactly what we’re saying because she is the vice president currently :)"
5372,Vote as if she lost
5373,why does trump have no fuckin neck in that pic. whys his suit 20x oversized. who let him on stage like that lmao
5374,Not that it really matters but Trump was worse than Biden tonight. Absolute nonsensical answers.
5375,Fox News Headlne:  Trump comes in with a commanding second place in presidential debate!
5376,"On the Republican subreddit they all think Trump smashed it despite it being ""3 against 1"". Weirdos, the lot of them."
5377,"Yeah this debate is what did it for me. I voted Trump in 2016 and 2020 but it’s clear with age he’s just completely gone off the rails, and this debate proved it for me. I’ve been on the fence about him recently but after tonight I will 100% be voting for Kamala."
5378,"> ""She wasn’t very specific when asked certain things,"" one voter said. ""She knows how to pull at your heartstrings. She knows how to be dramatic in a way that will touch the heart of Americans while avoiding the hot button questions.""

She??"
5379,Even Fox is admitting a woman bitch slapped his ass.  What a loser.
5380,"Sometimes you need to debate the pigeon, to show everyone that it's just a pigeon."
5381,"Fox News headline- 


Harris Guilty of Elder Abuse"
5382,"I live in a Trump county—people have Trump flags flying in front of their old, beat up houses.  I was a little nervous to wear my Madame President hat around town until last night’s debate now I’m wearing it everyday and everywhere!"
5383,I became angry that the mods didn't allow Harris the chance for rebuttal to Oranges outbursts and nonsense. But then it was obvious the more he butted in the crazier he seemed.
5384,"He didn’t look presidential. Harris appeared competent, civil and studied. His arse was handed to him on every issue."
5385,"The simple fact that Trump keeps saying he won the 2020 election even though they have audited results numerous times and gone through court case after court case, is the definition of incompetence. Republican led election boards over and over have found no large instances of fraud. When they found fraud, it was usually for Trump! Unreal"
5386,"> ""I think she won the debate from my perspective, because he was so bad and he just sounds so repetitive, but I think she’s weak. She’s weak on the substance and she’s weak on the facts,"" the voter added.  
  
I wish reporters would follow up on things like this. 'Which facts? which facts do you think she is weak on? how so?'"
5387,"David Frum, The Atlantic:  “How Harris Roped a Dope”"
5388,The best part is that Trump now gets the rest of this week to slowly realize that his last best chance not to do jail time probably vanished after this performance.
5389,She peeled the orange.  That was brutal.
5390,100% She cooked him live on stage. It wasn't even close.
5391,The Done Don!
5392,She ass whooped him so bad even Fox Talk Entertainment can't spin it for his benefit.
5393,Even the fox panel said 14 to 6 that She won the debate🤨
5394,"“She was not specific about things she was asked, she just skirted around the questions”

Did they actually listen? If she skirted the questions, wtf did he do?! Utterly mind boggling and sad to me that my family who said “I’ll decide after the debate” still say they will vote trump."
5395,"A lot of these undecideds are what’s called “low information voters” and from that clip on the Fox site it’s very clear how low-information they are… even information right in front of them that was just presented to them during the debate by Harris, they couldn’t grasp. Saying she was short on facts? Low information retention seems to be a theme with them."
5396,"Waste no time registering in your local district. For now, until Taylor Swift shares more info: an NYT voting calendar: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/2024-election-calendar.html"
5397,"When Fox throws Trump under the bus, you know things are over. The end  is near.  They just couldnt find a way to rescue Trump this time."
5398,She already won when she walked out and shook hands.
5399,"I was watching in real time just as a tourist to the channel, and I couldn't believe what I was hearing. 

  
Of course when I checked back Hannity was blowing smoke up Vance's ass, so it was back to usual."
5400,"These panels are always odd. Who thinks you are getting detailed policy proposals in an answer to a question when you have two minutes to do so. And those criticizing Kamala on lack of substance but don’t say the same about trump? Also, driving me crazy, his one line that seems to be sticking is she had four years why didn’t she do everything she is trying to do? Yet he is basically running on the same things he ran on the first time and did not do. Or his extra stupid, if she would have built the wall? I thought you built the wall and Mexico paid for it."
5401,Even Fox is like “bruuuuh”. It’s over.
5402,I have concepts of a debate.
5403,And yet they report that Donald won. Fox News needs to be shut down
5404,"Helen Keller would say she won’t the debate. The man is a lunatic and needs to be put out to pasture, not in the Oval Office. Plain and fuckin simple."
5405,She completely wrecked him. Made him look like a child.
5406,"Do not boo, or cheer, too much.

VOTE!"
5407,"From a logical perspective if an undecided voter was watching, the choice seems clear... 

An energetic forward thinking person with plans, or an old guy who thinks Haitians are eating dogs and still doesn't have a healthcare plan.. even after 4 years as president.

The MAGA brainwashed will not change.. they have special interests like guns or white supremacy that can only exist in a Trump world. 

However, most Americans aren't lunatics and any educated open minded person that watched last night would have to back Harris. 

r/BanishTrump"
5408,"""Oh, well obviously this was mainstream media viewers sabotaging our poll"""
5409,These are the same people who say 'bullshit' every time the opponent of their favorite sports team scores a clean point unimpeded.
5410,"Fox News commentators were stunned after the debate. They threw him under the bus or as Watters suggests, the debate was a train wreck for Trump. 24 hours later, they are back pedaling and saying ABC News was unfair with Trump. They also had to mention the fact that ABC News was affiliated with Disney, getting back at Disney for withdrawing their contributions to the Trump campaign. Just like Trump,  Fox has to blame somebody."
5411,I don't know how to react to this.
5412,I love how his loser followers are trying to claim victory!! REALLY????? How much Kool aid did you drink tonight??
5413,"Oh, the walls at Mara-Lardo will run with ketchup."
5414,"Stevie Wonder be like, no shit?"
5415,And not just by a little.
5416,Total massacre
5417,"Faux Entertainment says whatever it wants, but it ain’t News"
5418,"Yeah, but DJT stock holders don't agree, it dropped over $3 a share overnight after that debacle. And there are only two types of people who had stock to sell last night, foreign investors who want to bribe him and the MAGA true believers. 

They are shook."
5419,She led him around on a leash from the jump. It was like the Folsom Street Fair on national TV.
5420,"Panel reasoning was the usual nonsense would expect from Fox News. 5 out of 12 thought he won and their biggest complaint was Harris’ wasn’t fact based and pulling at heart strings. Which fine don’t disagree as that is politics 101 but good god it shows how warped they are that the facts part doesn’t apply to Trump. He wouldn’t know how to pull at heartstrings if he was scripted and they let someone read the lines for him. The bar is so low for him that as long as he shows up, he did well."
5421,You mean Fox News Marxist RINO panel! /s
5422,"From start to end, Trump looked like a frightened little boy. Weak and trembling, unable to look the adult in the eyes."
5423,You can tell this a group that wanted Trump to win and even then they couldn't bring themselves to it.12-5 is rough.
5424,Maybe he’ll ask Fox to have their license pulled like ABC haha.
5425,"That’s great, but people still root for their favorite sports team, even after a bad season. 

Will this actually change any votes?  I’m skeptical. MAGAts are dumb and committed. "
5426,"I would be concerned for the comprehension and cognitive abilities of a lot of these people.

Like, they try to hammer Harris for lack of specifics, but dont' say anything about Trump's racism and general cognitive decline."
5427,"""Every single poll says I won the debate. ""

~DJT 47 seconds ago"
5428,"Those two were master baiters. He fell every one. He tried though: Biden doesn't like you, put out, I'm talking. She had composure and her ability as a prosecuting attorney against the convicted-felon-who-keeps-losing elections, was very evident."
5429,Honestly when said “They’re  eating the dogs”! I laughed out loud. He sounded like a crazy person!
5430,"Trump was a whole new self up there. We no longer saw the orange buffoon screaming nonsense 

We saw an apple baffoon screaming nonsense instead 

He is a man of many fruits"
5431,"Anyone else mis read this:  
  
""Asked why they thought Harris won, many voters expressed that Trump did not know how to attack his new opponent in the race.""     
  
as:

""Asked why they thought Harris won, many voters expressed that Trump did not know how to attack his new opponent ***on her*** race."
5432,Fox News showing objectivity? I can't believe it.
5433,"Eating the dogs and cats, all the pets are being eaten by the immigrants who fill their tummy’s with Fido and Felix before heading out to murder, rape and pillage.  Did I mention that the crime rates in every country but ours are going down because they send us all the criminals and lunatics from the Trump asylum, I mean nut house…😏"
5434,"Holy shit, this panel. After the satisfying hand vote that Harris won the debate, they go on to say the stupidest shit you can imagine. I don’t think a single one of these saps will actually consider voting for the Democratic ticket. What a joke."
5435,"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-voter-panel-says-harris-won-debate) reduced by 85%. (I'm a bot)
*****
> A Fox News Digital focus group of voters across the board shared who they believe won the face-off between the 2024 candidates at Tuesday night&#039;s debate.

> Voters taking part in a Fox News Digital panel reacting to the debate said that Vice President Kamala Harris came away from the event with a victory.

> Asked who they thought won the debate, 12 voters on the panel raised their hand for Harris while just five indicated they believed former President Donald Trump won.

5436,Trump just lifted himself three feet into the air by evacuating his bowels
5437,No shit
5438,Oh he’s gunna be mad. Bigly.
5439,TFG gonna be shitting on Fox News* again. Let's see how long it takes them to toss his salad again.
5440,Common Fucking Sense says she won that debate.
5441,"The thing I wish she would’ve done is when she have her spiel about the lies that we’d hear, for her to also say we’d see someone be truly “weird”.

He would’ve imploded!"
5442,Your brain would have to be undeveloped to think otherwise.
5443,But will they come to their senses and vote for her? I sure hope so
5444,So? She kicked the shit out of him.
5445,"If you are bored today, check out the you know what subreddit. It’s uh…something"
5446,Should be calling it a pig butchering instead of a debate.
5447,"But Tim pool said everyone thought their own side won? I’m confused, he wouldn’t lie like that?"
5448,"Well hold on now, did she? Trump was claiming within 5 minutes of the debate ending that he won, and their polls were showing 94% to 13% and 76% to 23% his numbers couldn’t lie could they? They couldn’t be made up on the spot could they?"
5449,I'm already exhausted with Trump's excuses. There's no way that people are out there feeling sorry for Donnie after the way the moderators treated him. He just doesn't seem very powerful to me. Much more like a whiny adolescent. I'd put him at an arrested development age of 6. I wonder what happened to him then to stunt his emotional growth?
5450,Well finally got round to watching a recording of the debate and I think that t***p did well to finish 3rd in a 2 horse race.
5451,“And I’ll still vote for trump!”
5452,So much cope on arcon rn.
5453,Trump loves strongmen. He wants to be like them.
5454,Trump looked like a puppy dog that shit in the corner and now sees his owner walking into the room.
5455,The echo chamber sub that doesn’t have the backbone to ever allow non flaired comments seems to think he won. We live in alternate realities
5456,"Trump said that he won the debate, so that's how you know he lost, since everything he says by definition is untrue."
5457,Just won? She butchered him.
5458,"Yeah, their whining now is say that she must have cheated and gotten the questions early"
5459,Everyone knows it. We all know it. And Grump knows it.
5460,"Anyone with critical thinking skills should come to this conclusion. Sadly, there will still be undecided voters after the debate. The short, yellow bus will always be full in America."
5461,Knowing is one thing. Admitting is another.
5462,Even the comments over on r/republican are saying tRump lost and messed up the debate. Lol
5463,"Anyone who watched Jan 6 knows there is no debate, it is not political or about policy, that Trump should have been arrested long before for being a traitor and should never have been sworn in 2016 because of his election fraud . It’s a hateful child yelling into the air to scare the weak minded and gullible people we know. He is a stain and a poison, not a debater, a policy maker, and never a president"
5464,I put Fox New on and they were trembling in their boots; talking about how great he did for having been given the tougher questions. It was like watching the Twilight Zone. The gaslighting Fox does to its audience should be criminal.
5465,"Nah man MAGAts are crazy. Trump hasn't technically won a single debate in the history of his debates. Biden just looked really old, that's the only one. Trump never says anything of substance, ever."
5466,Except Newsmax viewers.
5467,Their cult leader is always a winner though. /s
5468,"even the ones who say he won know he lost , they just don't care because 'insert x thing' that they vote R no matter what."
5469,"I 've seen several ""news"" sources post GOP talking points from BEFORE the debate claiming they were reason why Trump won the debate.  They hope people didn't watch, and believe the BS."
5470,The Last Word Turd really walked himself into a jail cell last night.
5471,Unless you watched it along with people in the Conservative subreddit. Or on Truth Social. I invite you to check either of them out. They're delusional.
5472,"It's not just about winning. Everyone gets graded on a curve. You can still ""win"" a debate by being better than expected as compared to your opponent. That being said, trump didn't even live up to his already low bar, and Harris basically met hers. So kudos to her i guess."
5473,"Anyone with a brain.  Go over to the ""Flaired users only"" sub."
5474,"MGT and Trump both accused ABC of being against them, which demonstrates they thought Trump lost the debate, and therefore had to come up with excuses as to why."
5475,"Kinda hard to dismiss it when the other candidate said ""transgender operations on illegal aliens in prison""."
5476,She played him like a fiddle. It was kind of hilarious to watch how she’d just slip in a little jab that I’m sure was calculated to tempt him into a deranged rant.
5477,"Yes, thank you."
5478,"My favorite was Kamala mouthing “this mother fucker” at Trump, realizing she was on live TV and couldn’t say that, and referring to him as “the former President here”. It’s towards the end of the second part of the debate during the Afghanistan discussion."
5479,"Mine is Michael Steele on MSNBC "" She ( Harris ) spanked that ass! """
5480,“He’s clearly having a hard time processing that.” 💀
5481,"There were a lot of great lines, but I loved when she told people to go to his rallies.  Such a subtle power move."
5482,Mine was “I have a concept of a plan”
5483,His species has an instinctual fear of prosecutors.
5484,"She had him from the moment she forced the handshake and introduced herself. He couldn’t face her.

Check your registration if you haven’t lately. [VOTE!](https://www.vote.org/)"
5485,"He didn't want to see that look of disappointed judgment on her face.
 
He likely did the same thing to his mother when she called him to task for being an idiot."
5486,"For a guy who kept repeating the cat lie, he sure looked like one."
5487,She set the tone early when she walked over to his podium and basically forced and handshake
5488,"wish she would have told him to look at her. 

LOOK AT ME DONALD"
5489," it’s wild to see how even Fox News couldn’t spin the debate in Trump's favor this time. I guess the whole ""strongman"" act just doesn’t work when you’re face to face with someone prepared to call out the nonsense. Seems like even some lifelong supporters are starting to see the cracks."
5490,"The thing about revolutions is that they happen slowly, then all at once, and when they start to die, there’s a moment when everyone knows the revolution is over—including the leader and their committed dead-enders—but the increasingly hollow pantomime continues."
5491,He’s too weak to turn his neck.
5492,At least her answers were on the subject of the question. When Trump was asked if he regretted anything about January 6 he went right back to talking about illegal immigrants.
5493,"It couldn't have been more clear than in their closing statements. Hers was all about her policies and plans, his was just yelling about her."
5494,"I think the only thing she didn’t necessarily talk about was immigration but tbh I live in texas and I’m not seeing any epidemic of crime with immigrants… 

Also I’m not sure how they expect immigrants to vote?? Like how? Texas makes it so hard to register to vote already and we think immigrants are gonna be able to? Lmao"
5495,"I mean there were a few questions she avoided answering, but for her it was a few as opposed to Trump where it was basically all of them"
5496,Imagine saying this and then pointing to Trump as having specific policies. Not a serious person. 
5497,">Imagine saying this about Kamala, who talked about numerous SPECIFIC policies

I felt like I was losing my mind during some of the live debate discussions because people were like ""but what are her policies!?"""
5498,"👏 

“Kamala was too emotional!”

(Trump rants and raves and whines, full of emotion, about losing the 2020 election and his rally sizes) “He was just expressing his opinion! He’s allowed to get mad about the stuff that bothers him! He’s a passionate guy!”

Just say that you hate women, “undecided” voter 🙄"
5499,"There *were* several questions she avoided answering entirely and just filibustered her time on. 

Didn’t change my mind about her one iota, HARRIS/WALZ"
5500,"This is the continuation of lopsided expectations that has followed Trump since 2015... Kamala is supposed to fix huge issues in two-minute sound bites, Trump can just rant endlessly about how terrible everything supposedly is. I'm sure Trump's performance won points with people that are already voting for him, but I'm not sure why he thinks that helps him."
5501,"That’s the quote that jumped out to me, but also for another reason - Trump exaggerates everything. Imagine saying Harris wasn’t specific when Trump was on stage saying every single Democratic politician and voter wanted Roe v Wade overturned, for example.  Talk about a double-standard."
5502,"I mean, change the pronoun and it’s Trump not Kamala in that quote. Making people viscerally afraid is touching their heart."
5503,There are so many Trump voters out there who just can’t say they’re voting for Trump. They know how stupid they’d look if they admitted it. So they’ll throw out any stupid rationale. It’s like pretending you cared about Hillary’s emails. They didn’t give a shit about that either. 
5504,"Meanwhile Elon is on his Twitter, saying he’ll impregnate Taylor Swift.

https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1833728804579111268?s=46&t=UGuPlZKPxIIre61KB2mpuA"
5505,"It’s like Monty Python’s Black Knight: “Alright, we’ll call it a draw.”

  
edit:typo"
5506,Well he didn’t shit himself or use the N word so technically he did better than expected.
5507,The media will be tripping over themselves tomorrow to sane wash Trumps balls after his fail tonight. Gotta keep that horse race going!
5508,I read a few comments and turned it off. Delusional people saying everyone was against him and it was rigged. How does one rig a debate when he was able to freely talk?
5509,"yeah they’re posting the early results of an online poll from a Fox website that shows 92% of people saying Trump won the debate. Then Trump cited that same unscientific poll on Fox News with Hannity.

Like he clearly lost, so why are they pretending that 92% would say he won. At least pick a believable number."
5510,"They always have, they are, and they will never stop doing that. Mainstream Corporate Media and their unfathomably unending source of greed has been, is and will always be the biggest reason why the situation since 2016 got this bad, they are squarely to blame for Trump’s rise to prominence.

Instead of shutting down FoxNews talking points, point blank, they have regularly given indirect credibility to them, so that they don’t alienate any particular segment of the population.

If media were to truly report objectively instead of doling out various flavors of truth for people with alternative taste palettes for reality, USA or more specifically a significant portion of the US would never have become this deranged. They see themselves as the fourth pillar of democracy, but I have viewed them as the jackhammer to democracy for a long while ever since they have shamelessly abdicated their responsibility for Trump mania."
5511,">MAGA and Nazi types on Elon’s twitter

I don't hate anybody, but I absolutely ***despise*** shills/hypesters like them."
5512,"They've had so much of the Flavor-Aid they think he not only did OK, they think he did a fantastic job and mopped the floor with her and both moderators, because it was 3 on 1 and the moderator bias won the election."
5513,Leon's*
5514,The medias job is to sell advertising. Thinking differently is fooling yourself.
5515,You mean Leon?
5516,"Elon needs to be investigated for election interference. Deleting Harris’ account, posting absolutely untrue and misleading things, etc."
5517,"My enlightened centrist dad: ""they were about tied. Kamala was more sane, but Trump had more balls, and that's really important for a president to have y'knoe""


(I wish I were paraphrasing)


Thank God we're Canadian. I'm 100% convinced that's the only reason he hasn't contracted Fox News brain at this point."
5518,Perhaps Trump voters are unclear on the concept of “facts.” 
5519,She didn’t specifically answer if Americans were better off than 4 years ago or why they haven’t lifted Trump’a tariffs if they’re so bad. She still gave good answers but didn’t directly answer the question
5520,"By tomorrow they will have their debate talking points down and within a couple of days those members of Trump cult who still want in will be fed the new narrative.

Vote. Blue all the way down."
5521,This the is extinction burst before they have to acknowledge he's not doing well to preserve some reputation
5522,they know they're on the verge of being destroyed.  Putin put in extra pressure on all these Russian assets to save the insane moron.
5523,"I like how they call it ""The spin room"". Lol"
5524,"Exactly.  They guy was punched in the gut, and babbling by the end of the night, and they aren't crucifying him like they did Biden, they are cleaning it up, spinning it, letting him get away with his totally disastrous effect on the economy.  I have no idea how a President who ran the country totally into the ground, and has stolen, cheated, and defrauded everyone he's dealt with in his business career, and used bankruptcy as a business strategy could possibly be considered better on the economy than Biden.  Is the press completely asleep?  

We try that as a nation-  and we will end up as Venezuela, and take the rest of the world with us.  Economic crimes are not victimless crimes.  Trump can afford all that gilded furniture because he has mercilessly trashed so many people with whom he did business.  I notice whenever they show Mar a Logo, it's not the utter decadent opulence that Trump lives with, it's a row of American Flags.  And he's doing it again- and Trumps threatening to close down the government if he doesn't get his own way on something yet again.  I keep wondering how this is not a more prevalent theme in the press.  

Yes we are all exhausted by the total media gaslighting, but but but!  We still have a terrific country and it's worth the effort to rescue it from the worst people in our society."
5525,I think it's cause the other moments with eating cats and transgender illegal alien surgery also show that and are just fucking funny.
5526,And he has had eight plus years for this!
5527,"AFTER 7 YEARS since the failed repeal in 2017 ALL HE HAS is a ""concept of a plan"".  So weak.  7 years and that's what hes got?!"
5528,"I was on the senior leadership team at a fortune 200 company. 

I saw someone say very similar words to an executive VP and I’ve never seen a bigger beat down from the executive to the team to the senior leadership team. In the real world you can lose your job for stuff like that."
5529,"Also not being able to say that he ""wants Ukraine to win."" That was such a softball and yet he can't do it because it'd make Daddy Putin mad.

Even the moderators called him out on not answering it and he still avoided it the second time."
5530,Yeah the election is in two months and the inauguration in 4. You really should have your policies ironed out by now lol.
5531,"It was very ""forgot to do my homework"""
5532,"Since you asked I have a concept of theories that might explain this behavior:

Racism, Sexism, Anti-semitism, lgbtq-phobia, qanon'ism."
5533,"That quote was a good one and should be focused on.  

He'd definitely been prepped for that question, because he originally tried saying that he shouldn't be expected to have any tangible plans since he's not president yet.  When the moderator preemptively countered by prefacing that Trump had been yelling these shallow, vague rantings 9 years ago while campaigning for his first election (then having 4 years to put a new system in place while in office), even Trump broke from his false logic for that ""concepts of plans"" response."
5534,"It would kill anyone else's campaign lol. 

And it's not about some small issue, it's a major issue which he spent a shit load of time on curing his first term running on before his first term. There's no excuse for someone who's been consistently insistent on replacing Obamacare to not have even a broad strokes outline of what the replacement would be. Maybe in 2016 there was an excuse."
5535,"NBC also had a panel of 3 “undecided” voters with one being a “democrat.” 

During the course of the conversation the host lady slipped up and said something to the effect of  in 2016 you voted for Trump and the voter interjected and the host lady said well all 3 of you voted for him.

Oops.

These segments are all fake."
5536,At least they sniffed her out instantly this time
5537,Fascinating how anyone is undecided between these two candidates
5538,"I saw that...

""I think Trump won the debate.

It's not about who you'd want in your wedding party, it's about who would run the country better

My life was better under Trump

*so you voted for him in 2016 and 2020?*

Yes.""

I just wanted the reporter to be like  ""well why the fuck are you here?"""
5539,"CBS also has a bunch of trump fart sniffer around  for their ""undecided voter"" in Pennsylvania"
5540,But then all they have is JD Vance 😂
5541,They can’t. He owns their party apparatus. Trump ain’t giving up the GOP grifting machine without a payoff. He will cost them dearly in every way possible.
5542,Can Trump even step down at this point? Biden wasn't the nominee yet. At this point the ballots are printed.
5543,Step down for what? It's hard to step down post convention - convention means you're on the ballot. He could give it to JD Vance
5544,"I kept waiting for her to simply reply with “Remember, we tried to take steps towards solving immigration issues, and you killed it.  We’ve already talked about that, so let’s stop virtue signaling about something that you single-handedly prevented.”

Kind of like when she called him out on his lies about guns with her “would you stop lying about that.”"
5545,It’s super nice of them to imbue the VP with the full powers of the President before she’s even elected like that.
5546,"MAGA thrives on stupid people. In fact,  Trump once said he loves uneducated people.  This is also why they want to destroy public schools."
5547,"TBF, Raygun did better in Paris than Trump did in Pennsylvania tonight."
5548,No doubt some of it learned as a prosecutor. Get the defendant to say something incriminating and then just watch them keep digging…
5549,"It matters _because_ she appealed to Pennsylvanians effectively, and also the rest of the US. People underestimate momentum; in order for Harris to win she needs people who otherwise might not have bothered to come out for her in swing states, and the way you do that is by having momentum and excitement behind you. Having your friends be excited about an election is a great indicator of whether you'll vote, and Harris is consistently more popular than Trump, so more folks voting is good for Harris.

After last night's debate, it'd be really hard to go to your mostly apolitical neighbor and say ""hey, this election is really important, have you considered voting for Trump?"" On the other hand, there are 100 sound bites Harris created just last night that would handily convince many normal folks who just aren't involved in politics that she's a levelheaded leader with a plan."
5550,"Yes it will definitely make a difference.  Polling showed a quarter of voters wanted to know more about her.  Focus groups consistently found people didn’t know though about her and they weren’t certainty she could stand up to our adversaries.

There is a big block of gettable voters out there still because of the short timeframe of her campaign and she got a bunch of them."
5551,Lots more undecided voters popped up when Biden stepped down. I think the political environment is very different than it was during the last debate. It won’t make a difference to maga cultists. But they aren’t the only Trump voters. There are people in the middle who can be influenced. And there are a lot who just could not being themselves to vote for Biden and were desperate for someone like her.
5552,"I love that during that eating cats and dogs segment, Kamala could be seeing mouthing ""unbelievable""."
5553,Agreed
5554,Vote as if you want this orange doorknob out of your life. Go early. It takes 15 minutes.
5555,ummm he has been dressing like that for ever.
5556,It’s what helps them sleep at night. As they clutch their FJB flag and cry themselves to sleep.
5557,They conveniently ignore the fact that the mods gave Trump much more time to speak than Harris.
5558,"Good for you being able to recognize it.

I don't think people get enough credit for being able to take in new information and change their opinions. To me it's the hallmark of being an adult. Happy to have you on this side.

I'm curious what if any specific moments did it for you? Or if it was more the whole package (if you don't mind sharing)"
5559,👏👏👏 let's go 💪💪💪
5560,I mean what is this account lol
5561,"I'm glad you finally see how wildly crazy this situation is. 

There's a time and a place, down the road, for legitimate conversations about policy and how to get America to where we want it, but it's not -- at this time -- a possibility with someone as gone as he is.

Thank you."
5562,Welcome! We have punch and pie!
5563,Sorry to be cynical but are you serious?
5564,"Buddy I hate to break it to you, he was off the rails the second he got off that escalator 


Actually it’s pretty well documented he was a pile of shit far earlier"
5565,"You forget, Trump has a concept of a plan."
5566,Maybe Trump got one of them free transgender surgeries we have all been hearing about.
5567,They kept turning his mic on every time he tried saying something. Turn that shit off and continue
5568,“They skirted the issues” is the free space in the middle of the bingo card. Any pundit can make that claim about anyone in the debate no matter what.
5569,"Of course they reported that he won, because if they say otherwise, they lose viewers. The same thing happened when Faux News (falsely) reported Trump’s election lies which resulted in their settling for almost $800 million to resolve a defamation lawsuit with the company Dominion who makes voting machines."
5570,Only if someone from Russia paid him
5571,They have concepts she won
5572,"The cope there is palpable. They know he did terrible, and they feel like shit. There is no question about that."
5573,"That place is the definition of weaponized stupidity, I hope the FBI is looking into the mods there and seeing if Russia is paying them as well."
5574,"He could have shit his pants, fell over and been removed from the stage and he would have “won”.  Maga will excuse anything and everything for the one true leader."
5575,"It’s funny because people call this sub an echo chamber.  And while it clearly has a left leaning bias, people here at least were not afraid to say how badly Biden performed in the last debate."
5576,"ehh, they clearly know he lost based on their banning log of long term flaired users who said something negative. They absolutely know he lost, they just deleted and mass banned."
5577,You mean r/russianbotfarm?
5578,"The right wing meme now is “well it was 1v3/1v5” implying that—because Trump got fact checked—the moderators were against him.

It’s major cope, and demonstrates even they know he’s super weak.

But the funniest part isn’t that, it’s their response to “well that’s because Harris didn’t lie about things.”

They start ranting that she lies about <insert thing that she was factually correct about> and reveal their deep deep brain worms. Seriously, like they say she lied about covid, or the “very fine people” thing. Nope. Not lies.

Then they try to say Trump’s line about “why didn’t you stop Russia invading Ukraine” was a debate winner, rather than Trump demonstrating his lack of knowledge about the conflict & the executive.

They’re in a delusional world."
5579,I wonder how much of that sub is the paid trolls of various nations just bouncing off each other.
5580,They were also mid debate bitching about how Trump kept getting fact checked and Harris wasn't.
5581,"Not the ones that watched it. They know.
 
I've also seen comments from undecided voters saying they will vote Harris."
5582,"I got curious and looked at their mega thread a couple times during the debate and there were actually quite a few flaired users saying that Trump was doing terribly.

I refreshed the page a couple minutes later and those comments, unsurprisingly, were no longer anywhere to be found. It’s a fucking cult."
5583,"Biggest group of snowflakes on the interwebz, and they refuse to acknowledge the blatant hypocrisy."
5584,I really wish the post debate commentator was Samuel L Jackson and he just went around smacking the shit out of lying ass gop clowns like tom cotton.
5585,"You could see in his body language how dejected he was when he said he won, he knew he lost. Slightly different from the many lies that he actually believes."
5586,Never believe anything until ~~Russia~~ Trump denies it.
5587,I don't know Trump really leaned in to talking and when he talked he talked about stuff that he was lying about which definitely beats Kamala who spoke with coherent outlines about ideas on policy that may help people outside of Leon Musk
5588,All of the best people are saying he won.
5589,Trump also stopped short of asking about a droid attack on the Wookiees.
5590,"Seriously.  Wouldn’t it have messed up your reality if he said ‘Yeah, I think I shit the bed with debate’ afterwards?"
5591,Trump literally shit his own pants on that stage. I applaud VP Harris for having the self control for not calling out the stench it must have caused.
5592,Has he said the debate was stolen from him?
5593,"If he walked out, did a dump then left he would still claim victory. He lives in a fantasy land."
5594,Check out his truth social post blatantly ripped and edited from either o donnel or maddow post debate reaction. 
5595,"When did that happen?

I had gone to bed shortly after the debate ended, but last i had heard he was down in the spin room claiming he overwhelmingly won and that polls were showing he did by 90, 80, 70 percent - whatever bullshit numbers he made up"
5596,237th trimester abortion
5597,"None of the prompts were curveballs. Anyone who prepped should have anticipated all these questions and rehearsed them on their shortlist. Just shows that he wasn't lying about not needing to prep.

The extent of his prep was no eye contact, no accordion hands (which he eventually dropped towards the end when he stopped being able to control himself). His handlers definitely drilled those points in since it was very uncharacteristic of him. Handlers had to know that eye contact would trigger further immaturity."
5598,"I’ve never understood that argument. Like, the questions are going to be the biggest current events topics, abortion, gun control, immigration, shit you said recently, and shit political opinion columnists have criticized you about. Has there ever been a surprise question at a presidential debate? And if there is one, you just pivot and talk about something else, like they always do. What is to cheat?"
5599,No they will be calling out the moderators as biased and claiming they wasted time doing Kamala's job for her.
5600,"With zero mention of Donold terrified to even look at her


Donold was pissing his diaper and everyone could see it. It was amazing.


Fuck MAGA"
5601,"And all it takes is even just the most minimal critical thinking skills to see just how absolutely fucked up that moron is. It’s not even a challenge, but my God do we have some real stupid motherfuckers."
5602,"I don’t even think it’s purely a question of critical thinking, it’s about being honest with oneself. There are a lot of people that can only function listening to things they want to hear, and they’ll insist the “other side” is doing the same thing. There’s no solution for it outside of letting actions and outcomes speak for themselves."
5603,There’s a clip of her saying (and laughing) that’s her favorite curse but she qualifies either “with an ‘r’” *or without an ‘r’* (ie: “muthafucka”) — I can’t remember.
5604,Mine was the part about Putin not being his friend and eating him for lunch.
5605,"I must have missed that part, I gotta rewatch that now."
5606,"please! do you have time-stamps, that's hilarious."
5607,Holy shit I missed this!
5608,A politician swearing really makes them feel a little more human
5609,Steele was *living* tonight
5610,The guy who was the RNC chair?
5611,And strong women
5612,Well he is an invertebrate.
5613,How does slime mold know what a prosecutor is?
5614,"""As the Trump slowly realizes he is trapped he deploys his last and most desperate defense, flop sweat and sour flatulence. The Prosecuter, however is undeterred and presses forward with the attack"" - David Attenborough probably"
5615,that’s pretty generous to imply he has the capacity for introspection or morality
5616,"Moderator: So would you veto a national abortion ban, yes or no?

Trump: Illegal immigrants!!

Moderator: So do you have any regrets about J6? Yes or No?

Trump: illegal immigrants will eat your cat!!

Moderator: so do you support Ukraine’s right to defend themselves, yes or no?

Trump: illegal immigrants are getting sex changes in prison!!! Covfefe!!!

Moderator: okay…"
5617,I was a little sad that Kamala didn't circle back to her point about how Trump constantly brings up immigration in every answer *except* the one about how he pressured Republicans in Congress kill the bipartisan border bill to help his election chances. Suddenly he wanted to talk about anything but border security.
5618,"That was the first part of his closing. The other 75% was yelling about Joe and Hunter Biden, who aren't even running!"
5619,Trump was asked point blank yes or no multiple times if he would sign an abortion ban as well as a few other times (I think regarding January 6th?) and he refused to answer. It’s so silly that kamala is getting more criticism for dodging questions especially when someone of the questions she dodged were like “can you explain 3 complicated policies in 2 minutes”
5620,yeah those are not undecided voters those are the closet racists or sexists who have to make up a reason as to why they cant vote for her.
5621,He is such a weirdo. Truly proof that money can’t buy everything because he has no real sense of manhood or intelligence like people claim.
5622,Isn’t Taylor’s guy a pro football player?  Let’s get both guys in the same room and see if Leon still feels so inclined.
5623,The guy has truly lost it.
5624,This man is far too publicly open with his breeding fetish.
5625,"God, he is so *weird*."
5626,Eww Xitter is getting worse
5627,What the actual fuck? That’s so predatory and gross.
5628,Link?? That's fucking crazy
5629,I can't tell if you're joking or not
5630,Nasty af bruh
5631,Maybe he wants to offload one of his kids onto her. He's got so many he constantly ignores.
5632,What the fuck could he possibly mean by that???
5633,That is the weirdest ass thing I have seen in a very long time. What?
5634,As if he needs more children to neglect
5635,In all the blatant insanity I’m sure this will be forgotten by tomorrow. In any sane reality this guy would be getting lambasted but there’s so much competition in the Crazy Olympics
5636,Barf
5637,"Yikes, that’s pathetic. 

Money can’t buy class. We all have something Leon will never have - a soul. :)"
5638,I could 100% see Trump shouting “I’ll bite your legs off!”
5639,"I mean, he shouted that PEOPLE IN SPRINGFIELD ARE EATING DOGS, THEY'RE EATING CATS, THEY'RE EATING THE PETS while Kamala laughed with perfect ""get a load of the crazy tinfoil hat guy shouting on the street corner"" energy. I don't think I could have come up with a more unhinged line. Everyone knows he's racist. Racists like that he's racist. This is... Wow."
5640,"> Well he didn’t shit himself...

I think he might have, though, when she went over to shake his hand."
5641,"I mean, none of us were on stage to smell the odor from his diaper."
5642,You can only see and watch the debate not smell it so we're not entirely sure he didn't shit himself.
5643,"They tried in the debate too, let him last word most topics and refused to make him follow the time limit rules."
5644,"If anything he was getting favorable treatment, even if that was ultimately to his detriment. 

He was constantly speaking over the moderators, who would relent and give him extra time. When she tried to get an edge in to respond to those moments, they shut *her* down rather than give her equal time in response."
5645,"The biggest complaint was that the debate was rigged because moderators fact-checked Trump more aggressively. They called out his claims that migrants are eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. They talked to the city manager who said there were no credible reports. And they called out his claim that babies are being murdered after being born. One of them said that there is no state where this is legal. Two prominent corrections about statements that Trump made. 

""*They continued to engage in so-called fact-checking of Donald Trump. They never did that to Kamala Harris.*"" - Tom Cotton (R-Ark)."
5646,"They think it was rigged because the moderate stated: That murdering babies is illegal in every state and that immigrants are not eating pets.

They are doing the ""Reality has a well known liberal bias"" for real."
5647,"not just freely talk, but had 50% more time TO talk. The debate moderators were clearly requested to let him rant and rave. REmember Harris was actually in favor of open mics to let him do such."
5648,"They're saying ""the moderators only fact-checked Trump!"" like yeah, man, that's what happens when you're the only one making up bullshit like pet-eating immigrants and ""post-birth abortion""

If Harris had made up wild nonsense she would have gotten fact-checked in real time too, friendos."
5649,"> so why are they pretending that 92% would say he won. At least pick a believable number

Funny, we always say that about “elections” in places like Russia and North Korea too."
5650,"They’ve been in “Dear Leader,” territory for a while now."
5651,"Breakfast Television Toronto (morning news program) ran a poll of viewers this morning and 19% somehow said Trump won the debate 


Even 19% is way, way too high for anyone who can think in general lol. And this being in Canada, not even in the country its taking place in 


American far right politics really do be infecting Canada as well"
5652,Fourth pillar? More like fifth column!
5653,It’s a whole ecosystem over there.
5654,"Even more importantly, their job is to keep people watching, clicking and reading. For that, they need to paint the narrative that this is close right up until the end."
5655,They have “alternative facts”.
5656,"It’s always a fun game guessing what their talking point will be and what stupid conspiracy theories will be on social media. 

The longer it takes them to put something coherent together the more you know they’re fucked"
5657,"And then they'll come here to make fools of themselves and leave behind a graveyard of forgotten buried comments, as is tradition."
5658,"Don't be naive, they will still support him till the end. Conservatives cannot admit they are wrong because that makes them weak, which is everything they loathe"
5659,It aint up to them. Trump will run again if he wants. He’s got the GOP by the balls.
5660,Can’t be an extinction burst if someone is still reinforcing the behavior.
5661,"He has been playing politician since 2011.  During that time, there are very few issues that have been discussed more than health care, and he simply doesn't have a plan yet!  Worse was when he followed up with, ""I don't know, I'm not the president.""  That sounds like a flake co-worker who doesn't take ownership of their work.  And also, he was the president and has been bitching for four years that he should still be the president, yet still no plan."
5662,Literally this. If you said this shit for a MIDDLE SCHOOL assignment you'd get a bad grade.
5663,The NBC 'undecided' voters were all 2 time trump voters fyi.
5664,Can u link that one? Cant find it. :P
5665,"Your criticism of NBC is odd. 
Do you think there aren’t people who are undecided right now _and who also_ voted Trump in 2016?

There’s a ton of those dumbasses out there my good man."
5666,"Not that I think the segments are real

But their previous voting history doesn’t mean they aren’t undecided for this election. 

Undecided just means they a) haven’t chosen a candidate to vote for or b) are unwilling to make a choice and will not vote"
5667,The only people who are actually undecided haven't been paying any attention whatsoever and probably don't even know how to vote.
5668,"Ok, good.  Whatever makes sense."
5669,"No doubt.  It was glorious.  

I hope we start seeing some good polling results soon.  She really should be double digits ahead of Trump.  

I think her dominance may even peel MAGA voters away from Trump.  They like to be dominated."
5670,Yeah this is their only comment ever.
5671,"Yeah, I don't buy this. This is probably someone who is trying to create a narrative."
5672,There is also weed and tacos.
5673,It’s only taken a decade to get there as well
5674,Concepts of a plan
5675,I'm loving this so much because it's something you can reference in real life that doesn't immediately appear political (stupid but not obviously political) but based on anyone else's response you'll immediately know who the crybabies are.
5676,"They were quiet on the debate all night until Taylor endorsed Harris. Now it's all tall about how celebrities should stay out of politics.


Sorry Kid Rock, Hulk Hogan, and even Rob Schneider didn't move the needle for you guys over in Maga-land."
5677,One comment I read said they’d watched the debates between T and Hillary several times and that T was “much more restrained” this time. My only question is… why? Who is rewatching old debates several times for funsies? What a strange hobby these folks have.
5678,"I honestly hope they feel like shit, as you say.

Maybe it will be one small nudge towards reflecting on their living in a cult echo chamber."
5679,"This is what they get for continuing to support Trump nearly four years after the mess that was his loss. Even during the Jan 6 impeachment, several Republicans voiced that he was unfit to be President, including McConnell, and yet here we are some 44 months later with Trump looking much older and more deranged. You sow what you reap."
5680,It will be the first time a reddit mod gets paid
5681,"We are biased, they are a cult. We are not the sane."
5682,There’s a banning log..?
5683,"Ya. It’s quite interesting. It curious popping in there and see a brigade of post with headlines stating the opposite of reality, and then very few comments or engagement. 

The difference between the two parties is staunching. Democrats old man falls apart in the debate, a real conversation happens to the leads to him being convinced to step down. 

The republicans old man has a complete and utter breakdown, they all double down on false reality and march forward. 

It was really interesting how Trump never tried to appeal to anyone other than his base. He’s lost the numbers game twice and the electoral game once, he must understand he has to win some people over, and he’s not doing that."
5684,"I think that is a large part of it for sure. When you do see any reasonable conservative takes, you see it get quickly stifled."
5685,"Say border one more time motherfucker! I dare you, I double dare you!"
5686,"As an Arkansan, I would love to see that. Pretty please."
5687,“The devil bowed his head because he knew that he’d been beat…”
5688,"its because hes only running in order to pardon himself and shield himself from the rest of the judgements that he cant pardon himself for.

I think hes coming to the realization that his 2016 win was a fluke that he cant recreate."
5689,The fact he felt he needed to go to the Spin Room at all is enough to tell you that.
5690,He looked dejected the whole debate. At one point when Kamala was scolding his entire existence he actually looked like he was thinking wow she is right and just looked like he knew it was over
5691,"A comment yesterday in response to something I said also anagrammed his last name.  


Leon Skum"
5692,"The Cats and Dogs of Springfield would agree, had they not been eaten."
5693,"Big guys, the news commentators like you've never seen, said ""sir, you were treated so unfairly, but won that debate by the biggest margin, margins like you've never seen."" And they are so impressed, people, like and more. Some of the... Great. Like we love Bobby Cronkite, right folks? One of the greats. He's never seen a performance like I had. ""Just the facts"" he used to say. The best kind of facts, and facts like you've never seen. "
5694,"bro, he was up there yelling and cursing like an elderly neighbor who needs assistant getting to the bathroom before he shits himself. He absolutely dropped a deuce in his depends that night."
5695,[He was bleating about it on Truth Social immediately following the debate.](https://i.redd.it/vwmbqip9h3od1.jpeg)
5696,Trimesters are 1/4th of a year
5697,"It's been noted before that the more he lies, the more his accordion comes out."
5698,"Honestly I thought the questions to both candidates were more than fair.  I didn't like that ABC moderators let Trump getting  the last word in on rebuttals, but in the end ABC doing that courtesy ended up helping Harris.  But you are spot on.  Those questions were all fair for both candidates and were essentially softballs with adequate prep."
5699,"So...mostly unrelated, but my girlfriend has a beagle with some anxiety issues and we have to tell people not to make eye contact with him for too long because he sees it as threatening and might lash out at you.


It's not great, but it is hilarious that Donald Trump's handlers have the same worries as I do about letting their perfect little good boy interact with strangers."
5700,"Yeah, I could have answered all of those questions with a firm opinion. Which is great, they were perfect for the undecided voter."
5701,Yeah anyone prepping for that debate would have seen those topics coming.
5702,Right.  A fifteen year old could have predicted those
5703,Already doing it. They're also saying she had audio feeder earrings.

5706,No “r” is what she said lol

5709,Yes. He hates Trump.
5710,I actually fear how much more broken their brains will become if she wins. Having a black male President already made them pants-on-head crazy.
5711,"Moderator:  So then, what is your plan for deporting these immigrants?


Trump:  Let me be clear, Kamala is the one who let these immigrants in.  They're totally destroying the fabric of our country [continues blaming Kamala for another 100 seconds without ever explaining how he would ""fix"" this existential threat]."
5712,"I would have liked her to point out that the end clients pay the tarrifs, not the chinese. Except that doesn't help with the current policies."
5713,"He's so pissed he's not running against Biden, you could see it all night."
5714,"The literal embodiment of the idea that money can't buy happiness.  

More money than anyone in the world, yet his kid won't talk to him and spends all day on social media posting stuff from r/iam14andthisisdeep"
5715,"It's quite telling in the way that he makes sure that people know who he is, and what he has ""done"".

You don't hear the CEO of General Motors (of which can you name without googling) doing something like this"
5716,He did back out of a rumble with Mark Zuckerberg.
5717,He’s huge.  Could probably just grab his head and let him flail.

5727,Harris: “You’re a loony.”
5728,"""What are you going to do, bleed on me?"""
5729,Tis but a flesh wound
5730,That’s the rest of his campaign.
5731,It wasn’t even his most unhinged line! He said Harris wants to perform transgender surgeries on illegal immigrants in prison!
5732,Her laughing at him was the best part of the debate. It's absolutely how you handle his crazy. Make him a laughing stock
5733,"This was the most upsetting moment of the debate for me.  She literally said “just this one time…” and they absolutely shut her down.  I was annoyed that they kept unmuting his mic, but then I realized it really was only helping Harris.  The one time she wanted to rebut though, NOPE."
5734,"Biased corrupt media!! Trump was right with this one, it’s just against the democrat nominee."
5735,Maybe if she had lied they would've fact checked her also
5736,"Yeah it's hardly the type of ""live fact checking"" I think many imagined but it makes sense. Only the most egregious ridiculous lies were fact checked so it only happened like 3x to Trump. But I was fine with it, there's limited time unless we're doing Pop Up Video style so just get the most insane statements your grandma is likely to believe. And on the flip side, Trump got double the speaking time which didn't really help him, and denied Harris the 1 request she made for extra time. "
5737,"The thing is, those two lies are so ridiculous. Fact checking them is like saying “no, the moon is not made of cheese”. I mean, come on… republicans believe the absolute stupidest shit."
5738,"If I've learned anything over the past decade, it's that 20-25% of the population is functionally insane."
5739,The current one is that Harris’s earrings were headphones. I legit seen someone arguing they look like H1 with a side by side photo where you can clearly tell the difference. Spoiler:they’re not.
5740,"They'll focus on two things:

- Biased moderators (lol, ok)  
- The Israeli/Palestinian conflict  

The first one is a tried and true Republican talking point that has come in various forms. Usually the words ""liberal media"" are involved. 

The second is a point that has been amplified over the entire course of the conflict to dissuade people from voting. It was clear from the jump that this is what they'd do. Despite the fact that Trump has literally said he'd ""finish the job"" it may work on some people. 

Bonus:

They may try to amplify political speak of non-answers. Again, hilarious in the face of Trump who couldn't stay on topic even if he actually wanted to."
5741,"Bush v Kerry, 2004. Early results in the afternoon appeared to be heavily in favor of Kerry. I spun my radio to AM to catch Sean Hannity’s opening radio show monologue. He was lambasting Bush and saying the GOP had embrace immigration to win Hispanics. Later it became clear that Bush was stronger than initially thought and would likely win. 

Hannity immediately switched back to W is great and fuck them immigrants without even catching his breath. When the stench of loss is too strong to ignore, they will tear Trump apart and pretend to never have heard of him."
5742,"And they figure they don’t have to admit they’re wrong, because they can throw wrenches in the gears when the Dems are in power, but only by a bit, and say “See? Should have gone with our guy!”

Soul-searching is beyond their capacity. They are not fully functioning adults."
5743,"It's much darker than that, they can't admit they're wrong because they think god is on their side and that means 0 negotiation, 0 give, 0 accountability, 0 compassion, 0 empathy. They think they are right and mandated by god and trump is his figurehead. They are absolutely sick in the head."
5744,"Agreed, but there’s no way with that dude’s lack of physical fitness, his age, his weight, and the stress of not having his investigations dropped alongside his continual rage-baiting will have him around to run again, imo"
5745,Hard to find undecided voters when Trump is so damned loud about his fundamental incompetence.
5746,"Wow can’t believe I found it and even more shocked they left this unedited.

5747,This is never not going to make me chuckle.
5748,I am still waiting for a taco truck on every corner.
5749,The orange felon has been working on his fantastic health care plan for 9 years now...with nothing to show for it. Definitely a stable genius 🍊 🤡
5750,God I hope that phrase catches on. It's hilarious.
5751,"Trump posted a fake AI endorsement from Taylor Swift. What did they expect her to do?

She practically had to publicly endorse a candidate after that."
5752,"😂 Yes, Trumpanzees, Taylor Swift’s 2024 presidential endorsement is so irrelevant that Trump pretended that she endorsed him and then happily bragged about it."
5753,"The unknown nobody Donald J Trump, maybe he should get on a TV show or something, get his name out there."
5754,They probably count watching clips on YT as watching it
5755,"After he loses this election he's going to walk the earth, like Caine in Kung Fu, to a non-extradition country."
5756,He skipped a gear and spun a ruse on pets that Haitians eat.
5757,i saw that somewhere yesterday as well. i like it much more than the standard elmo or elongated muskrat. because what have elmo and muskrats done to deserve that?
5758,“ People are saying” is trumpian for” I AM LYING‼️‼️‼️”
5759,I was really stoned and didn't even go wait it's a third of 9 not a third of 12 lol
5760,">she had audio feeder earrings

I wonder if they are the same ones that Hillary used?

Their whining hasn't changed in a decade."
5761,"I wanted him to call her a bitch, because the hellfire that would ensue would be the funniest thing alive."
5762,She had to choke down what she was about to say as it tried to leap out of her mouth. 😆
5763,"I mean she definitely takes a second to decide what to call him... but nowhere there does she mouth ""motherfucker"""
5764,"Any real republican would hate Trump more than any democrat ever could.

The guy turned their party over to the most extreme members and has done irreparable harm to the party."
5765,Down ballot vote and a landslide win in house and senate is necessary for legislation to pass to protect the U.S. from these nuts in future elections. SCOTUS ethics with teeth. We need a bigly win.
5766,Hopefully they just die quietly so the country can finally heal and move forward.
5767,"We're done making our choices based on fear of how the other side will react. 

Obama neutered the fuck out of himself to appease Republicans, we know better now."
5768,He said he would use local police.  Right down to the details of 2025.
5769,I saw an angry old man get his ass spanked! Of course he wishes he had a weaker opponent.
5770,"I mean. She had to clarify multiple times that she was, indeed, not Joe Biden."
5771,I'd have thought you could buy enough ketamine to make yourself happy but he even ruined that dream for me.
5772,Oh man I forgot about that. What a world we live in. 
5773,I mean his mom said no what real could he do his hands were tied guys
5774,I really wish that would have happened. Zuck would have brutalized him and the video would be one for the ages.
5775,"6'5"", 250 pounds."
5776,"For anyone who didn't catch that reference, it's because his new best buddy Trump forgets his name in his fascist rallies and calls him Leon."
5777,Gross. How do you even think like that?? Oh she definitely wants a child because JD Vance insulted childless cat owners ? How do you get to that?? Even applying schoolyard mentality it’s fucking stupid. What a simpleton.
5778,Maybe Leon just meant he would give her one of his. Heard the guy has a couple dozen at this point.
5779,Isn’t he one of those “have as many children as possible cuz my genes are best” guys?
5780,That one was way the fuck out there. I had a legit wtf moment when he said that. That’s a line one of us would make up as a sort of crazy-person-conspiracy-thought-collage as a joke to express the level of insanity these people operate in but not something we’d necessarily assume they would conclude or even present as a known lie that’s supposed to be convincing. That’s Onion article level crazy. But that stupid fuck actually laid that on the table. Fuckin nuts!
5781,And went on a rant about how his rallies are the best in history.  Walked right into that one.
5782,"They were actually defending that line on arrcon . 

Even if it's true, literally who gives a shit? Having a Presidential administration spend five minutes thinking about that issue is more expensive than the actual issue will ever be. 

Republicans are just deeply inefficient with time and money. They waste both fretting over such small, rare shit while completely ignoring things that actually impact Americans all the time, every day."
5783,Harris used her time very well. I think it actually worked out well for her that Trump ranted and raved like a fucking lunatic for an extended amount of time. People who barely pay attention are largely going to hear about the pet-eating illegals delusion.
5784,Not just a lie.  It needed to be a completely crazy pants lie to get fact checked.
5785,W didn't have a cult that will commit violence if Republicans didn't do what he said.
5786,They already bailed on Trump when DeSantis appeared to have lots of momentum. Then they circled back to the orange fascist after DeSantis imploded.
5787,">When the stench of loss is too strong to ignore, they will tear Trump apart and pretend to never have heard of him.

There's just one problem: Trump isn't going to accept being unseated as the head of the Republican party. He's going to fight tooth and nail to remain relevant even if it becomes clear he's no longer electorally viable. He'll lash out at anyone who moves against him and those attacks will be highly visible due to ongoing coverage of his legal entanglements.

Which introduces another crucial point: the electoral interference trial is going to be a national spectacle. Trump and former members of his administration are going to be scrutinized for one of the worst betrayals of the public trust in American history, an incident that many Republican figures have been blatantly lying about since it occurred.

Trump will be frantically trying to rally the party behind him, casting himself in the role of martyr and telling his supporters that he's all that's left standing between them and tyranny. That rhetoric will grow increasingly unhinged if a conviction begins to look likely, perhaps even to the point of incitement.

They will not be able to abandon him. They will not be able to quietly move on. Ultimately they'll be forced to make a choice between endorsing his version of events or breaking with it. Both options are unappealing.

If they join ranks behind Trump and attack the legitimacy of the trial they'll turn him into a cause celebre among Republicans. His grievances and lies will continue to warp the party's platform long after it's become obvious it's a losing formula.

On the other hand, if they accept the process and verdict as legitimate, what message does that send to their supporters? ""Sorry guys. Turns out Trump's actually a monster, everything the Democrats have been saying for the last eight years is true, and we've been lying to you about it the entire time."""
5788,See: the border bill.
5789,"Quite fascinating that the guy complains that Trump is trying to appeal to moderates by toning down his insults and rants and that he had stopped talking about ""America First"". It seems apparent that the guy is on the right and is only saying he is undecided because Trump is no longer appealing to his base instincts any more. It would either be Trump or ""None of the Above""."
5790,Wow someone needs to save that clip and repost it elsewhere
5791,And he said it in such a childlike way
5792,And yet she waited until it was the perfect timing to do so.
5793,Yeah once he did that he basically guaranteed she’d have to say something
5794,"This is why ""Look What You Made Me Do"" is stuck in my head today."
5795,"Seriously, WTF does this man think? He thinks we don't have receipts? He'll say something, and then say he never said it, then he'll pull a stunt like this as if Taylor Switft would never find out? LOL"
5796,Best we can offer is reality TV.
5797,Clearly this is why they leave the rallies early. 
5798,But why? Why are they so obsessed with his old debates?! It’s so weird
5799,"You know, he does look a bit like David Carradine.

He probably has the same hobbies."
5800,"Kamala said, ""Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again..."""
5801,People named Leon like “aah damnit!”
5802,"Well, he did say she puts out. Last night was just gross."
5803,"that is a very generous interpretation of the party.

All Trump did was make it okay to say the quiet parts out loud, and it isn't like the *extreme members* were some fringe minority of the party. They are the party."
5804,"Half those Republican assholes that were spinning for him last night hate his guts too.  They're just incredibly spineless, power-hungry losers.  Looking at you Marco Rubio."
5805,I am onboard for the big win - let’s do this
5806,They don't do anything quietly
5807,MTV celebrity death match live action edition.
5808,"In Canada we have a well-known furniture company called Leon's.  My childhood is full of their damn ""Leon's Don't Spend a Cent Event"" commercials.  

Every time I hear Leon, I think furniture.  Elon better hope JD doesn't make that same connection..."
5809,"""Wow! It's a ~~Elon~~ Leon!""

*points at truck that looks like it was made in Minecraft*"
5810,She signed her comment as a Childless Cat Lady so I assume that’s what he meant but also he’s gross
5811,"He claimed it happens to kids in school too. Go to school as a boy, come back with Gender Re-Assignment Surgery.


Nobody mention the fucking recovery time is more than a schoolday...."
5812,"You know he was cooked when he absolutely COULD NOT help himself and stopped to say “Hold on, let’s go back to the rally thing. Akshually, my rallies are the best.”

Played him like a god damn accordion"
5813,It didn’t take much effort to bait him into that or anything else man really showed how far gone he was
5814,I hope the cult burns the GOP to the ground in their rage. The cult is insane and the party is corrupt traitors. A pox on both.
5815,"Yes, but this is his last dance. There won’t be a Trump 2028."
5816,"I saw that too and it was incredibly enlightening. That guy made me realize how insulated of a life I live, because he was less intelligent than anyone I have had to interact with in years.  I mean, even the least educated people in the communities I regularly interact with, aren’t stupid enough to admit “I want a candidate who lashes out and insults people more often.  I’m disappointed that the candidate I want to support is trying to win more votes by appealing to a larger number of my countrymen”. 

That guy’s ignorance was a huge HOLY SHIT moment for me.  “This is America” 😬."
5817,Ann Coulter was “done with trump” after he wasn’t hawkish enough on immigration.
5818,"Right. I don’t understand why some here in the comments don’t get what makes a real undecided vs one that says they are because their former preferred candidate is not extreme enough. 

You can’t be undecided if the choice is maybe Trump but he has to be extreme. And oh yeah Harris did well in the debate, congrats.

These people already have a history with Trump and are right leaners. lol"
5819,"Yeah a wiz better come quick before they take this part down. It’s a matter of time. I wasn’t even watching, just left it in the background but when I heard this I had to do a triple take. Unreal."
5820,Now that song is stuck in my head.
5821,"Trump is basically a father figure to millions of temporarily embarrassed millionaires, so watching old videos of him in his prime is probably like watching home movies for them."
5822,"Some of them literally have no personality outside of him & the right wing grift machine.

They are empty vessels & they’ve been filled to the brim with shit"
5823,Deviant Americans often end up in Thailand. Epstein Island part deux
5824,We wait with bated breath.
5825,He said what?
5826,Right? These people were happy to follow Trump.
5827,"Republicans are authoritarians. Full stop. They believe in a “natural hierarchy” in which people naturally rise (or fall) to their “rightful place.”

What you’re seeing with Steele is the clash between two philosophies under that idea. Older Republicans are basically monarchists. They want a hereditary executive under the ideal that the ruling family is someone trained from birth to lead, well-educated, intelligent, who places the needs of his people in highest priority. A benevolent emperor.

Trump shreds their entire social Darwinist dreamscape. He is not intelligent, not trained, uneducated (despite a ridiculous opportunity which he ignored), and places his own desires first, last, and always. He is not benevolent, nor is he imperial. He is a stupid, vindictive, selfish, corrupt, weak, shit-slinging monkey that somehow managed to usurp the carefully curated throne they’ve been building for fifty-some years before their ubermensch could present himself. And in so doing, he has exiled all the true believers who were destined to take their own places in the forthcoming empire to shepherd humanity into a new golden age."
5828,Yeah it's his attempt at tongue in cheek humor that just...absolutely doesn't play to anyone but his own fragile ego.
5829,"Yeah, that one was also a wtf moment for me the other day. Just totally insane. You have to have severe brain rot to think that’s even plausible."
5830,Heart disease and karma 2028
5831,"Hannity and Rush made a scapegoat/villain out of a “liberal” 

It’s a loose term on purpose because it can be any position that’s not theirs, they stoked hatred and vitriol for “liberals” for 20 years then turned it into “anything that makes them mad is good, anything they stand for is bad” 

Then social media and edgelords decided it was enough to be positionless and let your political dogma start and end with “owning the libs”. It doesn’t matter what the policy is, whether it’s antithetical to what you claim your political positions are, or if your party is actually helping anyone or much less governing efficiently, as long as the libs are triggered you have won."
5832,You're welcome and/or I apologize.

> FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't know. I don't know. All I can say is I read where she was not Black, that she put out. And, I'll say that. And then I read that she was black. And that's okay. Either one was okay with me. That's up to her. That's up to her.

I can't really make sense of it. The crude meaning doesn't fit, but NO meaning fits. It *guess* it was a Freudian slip into crudity."
5834,"exactly.

he beat Jeb Bush, Rubio, Walker, Kasich, Cruz and a handful of others. and i'm pretty sure those are the kind of ""real republicans"" KnowMatter is referring to.

but the republican party base is just a brain addled as Trump, and that's why he won. they aren't the extreme, they are the base. 

the party wasn't turned over to the extremists. it's that republican political elite couldnt keep their brain addled moron base under control any more"
5835,"Musk is not funny. He's not clever enough and has the middle-school mentality of someone who finds the number ""420"" to be the pinnacle of humor."
5836,"It is obvious he did not mean it in the crude sense nor was it a freudian slip. I absolutely cannot stand the man to the point that the sound of his voice is physically repulsive to me, and it was a jumbled up nonsense statement, but it's really not hard to understand it was an unfinished thought/statement. ""All I can say is I read where she was not black, that she put out"" [into the news, media, or otherwise put out into the public sphere]. 

That she somehow didn't publicly embrace being black as part of her racial identity is ridiculous and untrue. But it is clear this is what Trump meant when he said ""that she put out"". It's also ridiculous and borderline disingenuous for anyone to entertain the idea that he meant anything remotely along the lines of ""that she put out"" [as in sex, or other similar crude innuendo]. 

There is a plethora of legitimate things to hit Donald Trump with. We don't need to twist his words into some kind of crude statement, he makes plenty of outright crude statements all on his own."

The actual post.  
And the full text for those who can't read it:

Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.  
  
Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.  
  
I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I’m voting for [@ kamalaharris](https://www.instagram.com/kamalaharris/?hl=en) because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate [@timwalz](https://www.instagram.com/timwalz/?hl=en), who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.  
  
I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it’s much easier to vote early. I’ll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.  
  
With love and hope,

5847,"And a nice sideswipe at the ""childless cat lady"" nonsense.

5850,"For those asking why she does it now, directly after the debate: To make it more clear that Harris was the winner of the debate. Showing people, now is the time to choose Harris.

To get headlines like these: Taylor Swift endorses Kamala Harris for president after debate with Donald Trump"
5851,"Each time I think the Vance pick couldn't be any more disastrous, something makes me reconsider.

5854,"She signed it as 
“Taylor Swift
Childless Cat Lady”

This is great news!"
5855,"Well, that's huge. Like...actually huge lol"
5856,I am a woman and I am rock hard right now lmao. Let's fucking GO.
5857,Never thought I'd be fighting side by side with a swiftie
5858,You ever get beat so bad in a debate that you accidentally activate the swifties?
5859,"Bah god, T Swift from the top rope."
5860,Make sure you vote against the smallest man that ever lived.
5861,"That is a *huge* base of supporters. After seeing how much flak Ticketmaster got from Swifties, this endorsement will mean a large and *very* enthusiastic group of voters is heading Harris's way.

You do not mess with a Swiftie."
5862,They’re currently reading it on MSNBC while talking to walz.
5863,May this era belong to Kamala
5864,There it is.
5865,"T Swift is probably the most influential person among American women in a generation, she’s doing Oprah numbers, this is a bigger deal than it may appear."
5866,I guess I'm a swiftie now
5867,Fucking slam dunk. Get fucked MAGATs
5868,"> With love and hope,

> Taylor Swift

> Childless Cat Lady


Love that lmao"
5869,"It’s over

EDIT: VOTE!"
5870,wtf I love Taylor now
5871,Harris stuffed him in a locker tonight and Swift slammed the door.
5872,Well there goes those conspiracy theorists that Swift wasnt going to endorse anyone
5873,I’m filled with hope. Trump was demolished on live tv and now the swifties have been activated
5874,It’s so fucking Joever
5875,"Right on cue, today was a good day lol"
5876,Bro is COOKED. Her signing off with “childless cat lady” was the BEST. Good game.
5877,Trump just got Swiftvoted
5878,Its over. GGs. Was clearly timed for the debate. Now ppl can stop bitching about not responding during the AI images
5879,Perfect timing
5880,Holy shit. Legitimate masterstroke from Taylor here. This is absolutely massive and timed to perfection ...
5881,"Ending the post with ""Taylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady"" is A+++."
5882,"Love her or hate her, this is a much more important development than the debate itself. It's sad to think Americans are influenced more strongly by celebrities than by good policy, but at least in this case, both point to the same candidate. The choice is clear."
5883,I don’t understand the argument that this is bad timing. It’s a 1-2 punch. It’s like getting the car rolling a bit before hitting the gas.
5884,"Chat, is this real?"
5885,"You can tell she was furious about the fake AI of her endorsing Trump, and she waited until the best possible moment to endorse Harris.

“Signed childless cat lady”

Special thank you to Vance for that extra nudge"
5886,"PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT

Just because Taylor Swift is endorsing Harris does not mean you shouldn't get out and vote. Please VOTE. VOTE your conscience vote against tyranny, and vote blue!"
5887,Incredibly timed on her part saying the debate was the tipping point. Might give the endorsement just that little bit of extra weight to push people on the fence.
5888,Swiftie here. Donated to the Harris/Walz campaign and bought a bunch of their merch.
5889,"And, so ends Donald Trump's attempt to become president. Hopefully he can shake it off."
5890,I told my wife that if Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala that I'd never complain about her music again lol
5891,"""Taylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady""

Oh my days it's the jugular"
5892,With a  photo of her in cat lady mode
5893,Trump is spiraling right now
5894,It is so very poetic that the women of the world will be Trump's downfall. I need *all* the popcorn
5895,"DONT GET COMPLACENT! Nothing is in the bag! Vote vote vote vote. And actually do it, too."
5896,"Thank you Taylor, I will stream folklore in your honor 🥳🥳🥳"
5897,"Before we get too excited, has Kid Rock posted anything tonight that might cancel this out?"
5898,and everyone was shitting on her i knew my girl would pull through
5899,"PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT

Do not. DO NOT think for one second that Republicans can't win. Don't make the same mistakes of 2016. Get out and vote. VOTE BLUE. Vote against tyranny. Its super kewl that Taylor is endorsing Harris, but absolutely do not think you don't need to vote. YOU DO. ITS UP TO ALL OF US TO VOTE."
5900,"He's gonna break social media with his rants tonight.  Harris slaughtered him in the debate, and now he's officially lost the Swifties!"
5901,Selecting JD Vance as VP will go down as the biggest unforced error in American politics
5902,"Walz was being interviewed live when this dropped!

Anchor: ""Signed, childless cat lady. I have to get your response to that Mr. Governor""

Walz: ""Wow! ...(Inaudible)...well all those things I am incredibly grateful first of all to Taylor Swift, I say that also as a cat owner, a fellow cat owner. Ah, look, Swifties you heard it, we know that it's there, that was eloquent! And it was clear. And that's the type of courage we need in America to stand up. We've seen it out of those republicans who were at the DNC, we've seen it out of women who would like to have their own personal lives kept personal, but are forced to go out there because they nearly died because they can't get abortion services in a pregnancy, and now you have somebody like Taylor Swift coming out and making that very clear. This would be the opportunity Swifties, ah, KamalaHarris.com, get on over there, give us a hand, get things going!"""
5903,Did....did...Taylor Swift just save democracy?
5904,"I'm not a Swiftie and I was pessimistic of whether she would. But this is brilliant. From encouraging registration, providing links, and most importantly calling attention to the debate clips and the policies, this was the best endorsement I've seen."
5905,This is the shittiest night Trump has had since Biden stepped down.
5906,How do the transgender illegal aliens getting operations in prison while eating their dogs feel about this?
5907,"It really was beautiful watching MAGA take the bait about her playing around with Trump supporters. 

Anybody who watched her documentary knew that she was always going to endorse Kamala. She hates him and has for at least a decade."
5908,The haters don’t know want to do with themselves right now. Swifties have been saying forever that she will time her endorsement and this clearly shows that she did just that.
5909,"She knew exactly what she was doing, waiting to endorse right after the debate.

God damn, I’m a T Swift fan now…"
5910,"The timing is beautiful.  Even the conservative media outlets that are doing their best to spin the debate won't be able to ignore it.

For Harris', who had a great debate performance, it's just even more momentum.

Swift's message is also stated in such a great way.  Calm.  Doesn't say you're wrong, but says why SHE is voting that way.  She doesn't even instruct people to vote for Harris.  This is just Taylor saying where she stands and why she stands there.

Republicans will attack her for the next week because she doesn't have kids, and that will also fall flat with independents voters."
5911,I’m a simple childless cat dad.  I know a few things. One is don’t fuck with swifties. Maga is done. Over. This is hell in the cell for them.
5912,It's Joever
5913,Oh shit! She has unleashed the horde!
5914,"Actually let out an ""Oh shit."" when I saw that headline. It's over, that's actually a big deal."
5915,Who ever thought that Dick Cheney and Taylor Swift would agree on something.
5916,"Even if you don’t love Taylor Swift, her endorsement is a huge deal. Plus, her calling out Trump for his fake AI endorsement is gonna piss off her fans even more and encourage them to vote"
5917,Literally buried every other thread the minute it broke. I'm fucking dying.
5918,She finally did it. She executed order Swifty Six.
5919,"It just keeps happening. 


The Biden step-down and Kamala endorsement happened just after the RNC, stealing Trump's thunder then. 


And now this announcement of Taylor Swift's endorsement is going to take over the media and take away any talk of his performance at the debate.


You love to see it."
5920,"I love all the MAGA lemmings dropping in to say ""So?"" and ""Who cares?"" when [*Donald Trump himself* was trying to mislead people into thinking Taylor Swift had endorsed him less than month ago](https://bbc.com/news/articles/c5y87l6rx5wo)."
5921,Pour one out for the cope jabronis who forgot she waited until October to endorse Biden. She picks her moments. But now that she endorsed Kamala brace for “it doesn’t matter anyway”
5922,"Holy shit she finally did it, and right after the debate that made Trump look like a vindictive ass with no real plans, only ""concepts of a plan"". This has not been a good night for Trump and I am totally here for it."
5923,"When you forget that Taylor is a childless cat lady.

Let's fucking go!!"
5924,"It was breaking news. Tim Walz was all smiles when Rachel Maddow read the Instagram to him and got to the ""I am endorsing..."" bit."
5925,This is incredible coordination and timing. Tim Walz just responded to it live on MSNBC. It was adorable.
5926,"AAAAHHHH!!!!!  
  
Holy cow that is clever timing. So even disinterested young swifties can immediately go - 'oh I better watch the debate' (or bits of it on tiktok) - and IMMEDIATELY get what this shitshow is about.   
  
Way to force multiply!   
  
Fuck me!  
  
The DNC are smashing it this time around!!!"
5927,"I like that she did it on the night of the debate. 

It just automatically gives Kamala the W for the night."
5928,"Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.

Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.

I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.

I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it’s much easier to vote early. I’ll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.

With love and hope,

Taylor Swift
Childless Cat Lady"
5929,"Harris/Walz, you belong with us."
5930,"Well, that’s an awesome momentum changer.

But guess what? Polls will go up and down. Your vote is all that matters. Nothing is in the bag.

Make sure you are registered to vote and don’t forget to vote on Election Day. And tell your friends and family on the fence how important this election is."
5931,Boy is cooked
5932,She signed the post “Childless Cat Lady” lol. Perfect.
5933,"Swift's first single on her next album to be titled ""Concepts of a Plan""."
5934,"Remember, it’s not enough to just vote for Harris/Walz!  If the MAGAts win either the House or the Senate, they can stall every piece of meaningful legislation!  We’ve got to vote for a blue straight ticket - vote in every Democrat if you want things to actually get fixed!"
5935,"All these MAGA cult members are so triggered by this, but were just fine when Hulk Hogan was tearing his shirt off on stage for Trump. Lol. 

Get better endorsements and you wouldn’t be quite so hurt. 

Start by getting a better candidate. Maybe the rest will follow."
5936,It's happening!!!
5937,Things are getting spicy now.
5938,It's so Joever
5939,"""Taylor Swift has a large and loyal fan base, with estimates of the number of fans ranging from 180 million to 100 million.""

Let's assume half are of voting age, and half of them are American and actually do go out and vote.  That would still be a nice number of votes for Harris. Go Go Childless cat lady!"
5940,"Just a reminder that Taylor Swift became a Democrat because of Marsha Blackburn. Blackburn refused to hear her out about a bill that would increase jail time for people who stalk women. 

One state legislator in Tennessee made this woman go from political neutral to publicly endorsing the Democrats in every election since."
5941,Swiftie Army reporting for duty 🫡🫡🫡
5942,This is a brutal night for Trump.
5943,Dick Cheney and Taylor Swift endorsing the same person is a wild timeline to be in.
5944,Daaaayum the Russian bots are making a showing on this thread.  I guess Putin’s threatened by Swifts army
5945,"His heart-touch when his name was mentioned in the statement (as read to him by Rachel) was so sweet

edit to add: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMcbJlidTCA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMcbJlidTCA)"
5946,“As a fellow cat owner…”
5947,is there a video?
5948,For sure. I watched it too and that dude can speak off the cuff. He has a very good natural flow and is confident.
5949,Vance about to be thrown out of Trump's headquarters like Jazz in the Fresh Prince.
5950,[deleted]
5951,"God knows I'm not taking down my ""Childless Cat Lady for Harris"" lawn sign any time soon."
5952,"Some serious FAFO there.


What an idiot. She’s been avoiding talking about politics for most of her career and he basically described our eras most powerful kingmaker as negatively as he could in three words."
5953,"Ok, good."
5954,"The whole point of this past-48 hours coordinated MIGRANTS EATING CATS thing is to try and change what happens when you search ""Vance"" and ""cat."" Their dumb fucking asses thought insulting a sizeable chunk of the US populace would play well but, shockingly, it did not."
5955,"> Taylor Swift

> Not a Couch"
5956,Dude has obviously never listened to Vigilante Shit. She was coming for them all along.
5957,JD Vance's couch is going to be *so* upset tonight.
5958,Only way it'd be better is if she did it on a couch.
5959,I’m watching MSNBC and Rachel Maddow stopped Tim Walz and read him her post. He was all smiles
5960,Maddow was talking with Walz and read out the whole thing.
5961,"So did MSNBC, in the middle of their interview with Tim Walz."
5962,Omg seriously? That makes me even more happy that is like ACTUALLY breaking news
5963,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWPUI3yi3LA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWPUI3yi3LA)
5964,CNN sent me a breaking news alert for this lmao
5965,Bah god do I hear Beyoncé’s music??? From the rafters!!? 🤯
5966,JD Vance really was the stupidest VP pick imaginable lmao
5967,While holding a cat.
5968,"Ah, J D Vance. 

A gift that keeps giving 😂"
5969,"Also she put a lot of thought into it, and i appreciate she didn’t just wave her flag and go woooo Kamala

She gave real reasons and common reasons among voters that appeal to the average person, and also celebrities with AI being able to mess with them

edit: who wrote it (her vs her publicists) is not really relevant. The post itself has the reasons and compelling events of her deciding to vote for Kamala, which is what my point was"
5970,I can’t wait to hear JD Vance be completely normal about this
5971,Lmao I like her quite a bit more now
5972,That was the chefs kiss to that post.
5973,"The most important part about the Swift endorsement **is we still have almost a month left of time to register young people in even the reddest of states, let alone swing states. Hell, her home state is Pennsylvania, which is one state Trump cannot afford to lose!**

That's a big Swiftin' deal.

[And remember, you can help them register and vote too. Here is a spreadsheet with countless ways to help in each state. We are not powerless, Swifty or otherwise.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jxO8g7q9VO3ZMAABcrvR7PMyX4Yl6dgIYhD3eRTKk1M/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

[https://vote.gov/](https://vote.gov/) - Pick a territory, and follow this step by step if you still need to register too. There is still time. **It's not too late!**"
5974,"> It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. 

lmao, she basically said ""'cause that AI garbage y'all pulled, I'm not doing any coy bullshit with cookies this time."""
5975,"Lol, read this as Britney and was wondering what Britney Spears got to do with this 😆"
5976,"Lol ...

""Taylor Swift  
Childless Cat Lady"""
5977,"> 
> 
> 
> 
> FUCKING FINALLY. Wonder how Brittany is gonna react

I'm so interested to see how much the ""we should love and accept each other even if people have different opinions"" bullshit is gonna extend to Taylor Swift full-on endorsing Harris."
5978,"Brittany won’t say a word because she’s the talentless one in the friend group. Her husband, Taylor, and Travis are the only reason anyone knows who she is. She will not jeopardize that"
5979,Who's Brittany?
5980,"I like that she also set an example of doing research before endorsing anyone. Sure, I think it's a bit of theatre, but it shows that she's not just going into this blindly, and it's not just a reaction."
5981,"Must be, since they didn't crash the site like they did with the last debate (or after Trump got shot)"
5982,Trump asked for nuclear war 💀 and now he gets it
5983,"Their current marching order is ""It was 3 against 1"" -- They're all repeating it like drones."
5984,You can really tell the sorry state Russia is in by how badly their trolls have been doing of late. 
5985,I think Elon is throttling this story on Twitter because it’s not coming up there.
5986,"Posted 21 minutes ago, nearly 2 million likes already."
5987,"A lot yes, though not all will be able to vote, but hopefully encourage their parents to vote for Harris as well."
5988,">Plus attacking Trump on posting AI altered images of her. 

This was so dumb. Everyone knows how hard she fought to control her own shit. I don't think this ends with just an endorsement. I think this ends with Taylor swift and Beyonce throwing a registration drive in like PA or something"
5989,It was “cat making eye contact while swatting something breakable off the table” sideswipe and I am here for it.
5990,Like ever
5991,We are not going back. Like ever.
5992,"But unlike Holyfield, his ear is undamaged."
5993,"People out here really thinking Taylor doesn’t know how to work the news cycle. I’m far from a fan but it was ALWAYS going to be a meticulously planned event for maximum exposure and effectiveness, her and her team are quite literally some of the most successful professional influencers in the entire world. "
5994,"I was dead ass wrong thinking she wasn't responding to the AI bullshit because she didn't want to offend conservatives (like MJ said, Republicans buy sneakers too).   I'm gladly eating humble pie and so appreciating the most perfect signature possible."
5995,"Yup, perfect timing - this is basically her saying emphatically that Kamala won, and let stop the media from trying to play horserace angle as much. The usual suspects will of course scream trump won like they always do, but good luck getting heard over someone with her amount of influence."
5996,I'd be surprised if she isn't in contact with campaign team and they discussed when to have her endorsement.
5997,"By following the debate, it also suggests that she's informed, unbiased, and waited to hear both sides address the big issues before solidifying her endorsement, which is more difficult to disqualify.


A lot of her fans are young and grew up in red households. Her endorsement means something regardless, but it's more persuasive when it comes off as genuine and educated rather than a product endorsement. "
5998,"Dukakis' tank, Howard Dean's high pitched scream, JD Vance's childless cat ladies, etc.  It's the damnedest things that cripple a candidacy."
5999,"It goes deeper than that.

The picture she posted is from her *Time* magazine ""Person of the Year"" photoshoot - a photoshoot where she (or her team) *specifically requested* that the cat be featured.

It is well known that Trump had a fake *Time* MotY cover hanging in his office, and that never making the cut was a pet peeve of his.

That means this was meticulously planned for maximum damage.

She and her team are very, very good."
6000,JD Vance might be the single most effective campaigner for Harris the Democrats ever had.
6001,"Love how she signed it! God, it's so great to see the Dems fully embracing memes."
6002,That's huge.
6003,"In the spin room after debate a reporter just asked him what his thoughts about Swift just endorsing Harris. 

He said ""I have no idea"".

I believe if you put that into Google translate it would roughly come out as ""Oh shit""."
6004,J. Deviance is getting the ketchup thrown at him tonight.
6005,"It's so fucking stupid that this matters, but you're right. It is great news."
6006,Absolutely devoured trump and Vance.
6007,And given that she's from Pennsylvania....
6008,"This is going to resonate with the ""undecideds"" amongst her fanbase.

It's going to look like she watched the debate, and after hearing them both talk, came to a decision.

Edit: undecideds is in quotes because at this point, no one is undecided on who to vote for. At this point it's undecided on whether they want to vote or now as they've become unengaged with the process."
6009,"Listen, it shouldn’t be this big of a deal, but it genuinely is. I don’t even really like her music, but I respect the hell out of her and how she handles her fame and power."
6010,same. my butthole is flexing.
6011,I just sent another donation to the Harris campaign. Let’s end this 🤝
6012,How about side by side with a friend?
6013,"""Swifties for Kamala"" raised $140k for the Harris campaign last month without Taylor's involvement, Swifties have BEEN activated"
6014,(JR voice) By Gawd! That man has a family! Will somebody stop this!
6015,"Good God almighty! Good God almighty! That killed him! As God as my witness, he is broken in half!"
6016,Five star frog splash
6017,Waiting for the glass shattering and Taylor downing 2 beers from the turnbuckle
6018,The Antihero.  Stares directly at the sun but never in the mirror
6019,If even a tenth of them voted that could well be the difference especially since she's from Pennsylvania which is a swing state
6020,"Fuci yeah, you don't. I'm a 36 year old man voting blue always, but Taylor Swift is HER."
6021,"I love that we have a very strong, confident leader in Kamala and a lil sweetie pie in Walz."
6022,… to us
6023,"Spot on mate! Oprah’s endorsement for Obama sealed it. Same here almost, but skewing even younger."
6024,"She's easily bigger than Oprah I'd argue. Swift has always been an A-lister sure, but in the last couple of years she's achieved more of a, most famous celebrity in the world, status and even people who aren't fans can appreciate her impact whilst Oprah was always divisive with some. This endorsement is huge"
6025,"As a mid-twenties dude - I find myself knowing like 20+ of her songs without intentionally listening to them 🤣 it’s funny how I grew up with listening to her first albums. I’m not saying I’m a Swiftie, but I am an OG listener"
6026,I think slam dunk is an understatement omg she absolutely knocked these mfs out
6027,It's Joever
6028,"sir, don’t worry, we have kid rock….basically the same thing! 

*-	trump campaign team*"
6029,We are never getting back together. . . like ever
6030,Thank JD Vance for triggering her with the mindless childless cat lady retort.
6031,I'm literally in tears now. What a night. A month ago I was numbing myself in preparation for another trump win but I'm feeling hope now.
6032,Debate blowout and this!
6033,I got a very clear picture of this in my head when I read your comment and laughed so hard
6034,She was definitely waiting for the right moment and this was definitely that.
6035,"Saw a lot of people extrapolating that Patrick, Brittany, her, and Kelce must all be Trump supporters. At least we can cross one off the list lol. (realistically I don’t think any of them are even with Brittany’s dumb comments)"
6036,Dark Brandon with his feet up on the Resolute Desk and lighting up a fat cigar in victory
6037,"I like how she specifically called out the AI bullshit as a reason why she was compelled to make this statement. ""Look what you made me do"" for real!"
6038,"That was really stressing me out and the ""other"" AI images that came out after the super bowl or whatever. I was hoping she would carry a torch and lead for some laws to be passed.  I just think in the future people will be doing AI images to random women and ruining lives"
6039,It's perfect timing. Right now both sides are wildly spinning the debate. Swift just put a huge spotlight on the idea that Harris won.. it's a massively smart way to set the narrative following the debate.
6040,"The argument is that you should spread these news hits out to dominate the cycle. That's wrong, but it's the argument.

This delivers a huge 1-2 punch combo of a debate victory and massive endorsement to convince a lot of younger, less engaged voters that supporting Kamala is important, at a moment when the largest number of them are paying attention."
6041,"Its real, on her instagram, with a pic of a cat, ended off “childless cat lady”

Touche."
6042,1.5 million likes in 17 minutes lol.
6043,Rachel Maddow just read it to Tim Walz live on air.

6045,On her official Insta/Threads
6046,"Yes.

Merry christmas."
6047,"Yes, the red states will be pulling all the gimmicks possible to throw out votes, to make sure you can't vote etc. They really want Trump to win this cycle."
6048,"In the last election, Democratic Boomers outvoted both Millennial and Gen Z voters.  It’s time for Millennials and Gen Z to take the mantle.  You got this!"
6049,"Girl, same! :)"
6050,“Got nuthin’ in my brain” has never felt more appropriate
6051,He's buying up Taylor Swift records to shoot in his backyard.
6052,"He retruthed a couple things, but it’s really hard to type out a full post on Truth with how hot it makes your phone."
6053,"NGL I was getting a little disillusioned there for a bit. But that's on me, deep down I knew how much she meant being on the right side of history was important to her. So glad she came through."
6054,No - Harris buried Trump during the debate; Swift is just (literally) putting the nail in the coffin.
6055,She sure did her part.
6056,He is so incredibly *genuine*.
6057,Please tell me you have a link so I can watch. 
6058,They cut away to the instagram post right when they mentioned his name. absolutely terrible direction there.
6059,"Just give me a Hulk Hogan endorsement. A couple of Kid Rock endorsements. Just whatever makes sense...

The MSG said they ""Jazzed him out the door"". I swear he even made the loud ""UuuuH!"" sound Jazz made too."

6064,Vance must be a wildly unpopular Christmas host because never have I seen a man so thoroughly cook his own goose.
6065,Walz will make my Christmas wishes come true if he brings up the childless cat lady comment and Taylor Swift in the VP debate 🙏
6066,"I am a not a lady, and I don't have any cats. In fact, I'm allergic to cats. I'm considering such a lawn sign as well."
6067,Maybe in two months. Maybe. 
6068,On her Instagram post she also says that Trump using AI to make it look like she endorsed him was a major catalyst.
6069,I don't think his tiny little brain can really comprehend the idea that women have actual power.
6070,"""Dont ever do that again you little bitch.""

- Taylor ""Michael Jordan"" Swift"
6071,Whatever makes sense…
6072,Hey whatever makes sense
6073,"Nah, she did even better than that; the photo was from her TIME Magazine Person of the Year shoot. It'll drive Trump nuts as soon as he finds out."
6074,he started getting giddy like a school girl. It was pretty funny.
6075,"Tim, imma let u finish but..."
6076,"They interrupted a vice presidential candidate to read Taylor’s announcement? 💀 💀 💀 

Sometimes this timeline is cool after all."
6077,This one works https://youtu.be/lMcbJlidTCA?si=QUR21qlAc8kF2c_j
6078,"I love how even Trump acted like he didn't know him, during a debate LMAO"
6079,"Almost like letting Don Jr. be in ""charge"" of it was a bad idea."
6080,I'm still convinced that he's a Sascha Baron Cohen character designed to tank the Republican campaign from the inside.
6081,"He was chosen because [he said he would not have certified the 2020 election](https://x.com/rpsagainsttrump/status/1833524309765329160?s=46&t=sZiMcuw9dSzMIjJ_V9vvGQ). Basically, if Trump gains power again JD will ensure that he never “loses” another election by refusing to certify it."
6082,"2024 is going to set the standard by which VPs picks are judged in the future. 

""On a scale of JD Vance to Tim Walz how would you rate this VP pick?"""
6083,And it wasn’t AI either.
6084,Her cat. While holding her cat.  
6085,What a night for cats in America. They’re being eaten by migrants in Ohio according to Trump. And now they’re helping endorse Kamala Harris.
6086,I thought the same. She said do your research on the issues that matter to you and vote accordingly. That was a very thoughtful endorsement.
6087,The calm instead of chaos line really hit well
6088,I’m sure there was a team to fine tune but I mean… she’s literally a writer haha she probably wrote most if not all of it.
6089,"Taylor’s a control freak.  While I think she likely ran her post by her PR folks for a last check before she posted it, I do think she wrote the post herself.  I don’t think she’d leave something like this to staff.  That’s not her style."
6090,"Can’t wait for Tim Walz vs JD Vance

He won’t be able to “okay great” his way through a debate"
6091,She throws shade with the best of em I’ll always give her that
6092,If Trump loses PA it’s probably game over for him
6093,"Hey young people in swing states. Did you know if you ever answer those opinion poll calls, your opinion gets overweighted because of the smaller sample size of actual respondents. Don’t go to x to scream into the void. Make the polls listen. 

And register. 

And I for one decided to put my money where my mouth is and found a local campaign office to donate to, not just for Kamala, but for my local race (BEGONE FITZPATRICK)."
6094,They gave her the perfect excuse lol
6095,I thought she was going to say how AI makes her uncomfortable as an artist but she kept it  on point driving home the “false information” angle.
6096,That and the childless cat lady obsession of JD Vance. She knew what she was doing signing it like that and adding the photo of her and Benjamin(her cat)
6097,"Right, leave Britney alone!"
6098,Same
6099,I don’t have a clue who this other Britney is so… yeah. Leave Britney alone. Leave her alone!
6100,"Honestly that's a ""you didn't even feel the knife until I wanted you to"" murder by words."
6101,Even put a picture of her and her cat 😂
6102,"I’m guessing Britney Mahomes would rather have an extremely famous friend than basically anything else, so I doubt she makes much fuss"
6103,I’m gonna guess it extends pretty easily to Taylor considering Brittany probably doesn’t actually give a fuck. And Brittany is not going to give up the relevancy Taylor brings her.
6104,Omg yes! I totally forgot about Britney! I wonder if we’ll see them around each or not anymore
6105,Yep - at this point she’s just someone’s wife
6106,Patrick Mahomes's wife.
6107,"There were a few but they didn't do a great job, they were drowned by the other commenters. 

Putin didn't put enough people on the early shift."
6108,The whole Russia funds the right scandal broke a bit ago. And bots SUDDENLY quieted down on a lot of sites.
6109,The losing side always complains about the refs cause they know the scoreboard says they're losers.
6110,"It's at 2.5 million likes now, and counting.

Edit: Jeez, I woke up to it clearing 6 million. It is 5 AM in the morning, and that’s east coast. Hardly anyone is up yet."
6111,If 1 out of 200 of her followers votes because of this it's going to be a landslide.
6112,Nearly 3 million likes just 20 minutes after that.
6113,[deleted]
6114,Many of us Swifties have been voting for over 30 years!
6115,My niece and her friends are Swifties. She just turned 18 and will be voting for the first time and yes her endorsement is huge. The age range of Swifts fans is large.
6116,89% of her fans are millennial or older generations and a good part of gen z can vote now
6117,"As I recall, her tour resumes in Florida in October. I can't imagine a better time to really start hammering the message."
6118,Holy shit that is the absurd timeline that I want to be a part of.
6119,Sheeeeiiit 😆
6120,I expect this to be on a talk show monologue by the end of the week.
6121,"You have been waiting your whole life for a comment with the perfect reference, and you knocked it out of the park with this one. Well done.  I salute you!"
6122,"I literally got downvoted earlier today for saying she was saving her endorsement for the most effective time. 

Suck it all 6 of you haters!"
6123,"Not to mention that the VMAs are on Wednesday where Taylor is up for numerous awards, so the conversation about her endorsement will naturally continue. This was played to perfection. Kudos to wise women"
6124,It was timed perfectly to hit the news cycle following the debate and days after to keep the buzz going and get her followers activated.
6125,"She also made a point she doesn't want anything to do with the AI stuff of her, and if there's one thing you never want to do, it's hit a billionaire in the pockets. That could really hurt her brand to just normalize it. Taylor Swift this and Taylor Swift that, all endorsed by Taylor Swift! Buy now!


The dumbest fucking thing they could have done was pretend Taylor Swift supported Trump. You know she doesn't. But she didn't tip her hand until they made her.


If Trump plays 4D chess I gotta wonder which fucking dimension he's playing in because I can't see one in the three I'm aware of."
6126,I'm excited for the plot twist where he comes out and reiterates that he is still a never trumper and he did it all to save democracy.
6127,"Plot twist, he hates trump so much he went incognito as a boot licker to unravel his campaign."
6128,I bet he has concepts of an idea
6129,And she controls the 3rd largest army (Swifties) in the world
6130,"From PA or not she's huge here. 


Last time she played in Philly the whole city was swamped with Swifties for weeks. Weeks. 

It was a good vibe honestly. They all fucking hated Trump. 

The biggest thing here is this will help convince a lot of younger women to vote."
6131,"If she can just get young women engaged in politics, it could change everything in this country."
6132,Exactly. The optics were right.
6133,It will also encourage younger voters to vote. A lot of them stay back; don’t think it’s important. I hope this helps turnout.
6134,that might be the taco bell
6135,"Aye, I could do that"
6136,"Ay, I could do that."
6137,Nah- his family sucks too… don’t stop it.
6138,Covert narcissism disguised as altruism like some kind of congressman 🔥
6139,"If Trump and Vance are smart, they would just leave this alone.  

Im not sure how many swifties would actually be compelled to go out and vote for Harris just because Taylor is voting for her.  I know it’s not zero, but it might just be like 10% or something along those lines.

However, if Trump or Vance open their mouths to retaliate, and say something negative about her, Im fairly certain that the fanbase will be on absolute fire with a level of determination that will cause major damage to their campaign.

Im betting they can’t help themselves and will light that fire"
6140,"From what I've been hearing, this election will more than likely come down to Pennsylvania. So this could be a big deal. Hopefully it encourages those in the 18-25 range to go vote for Kamala."
6141,As a 36 year old with 2 daughters…I feel cool playing her “old” stuff from like 2008 before my girls were even born.
6142,Between her crushing Trump tonight and Swift’s endorsement…..bad night for Team Orange.
6143,"We went from it being Joever, to being so Barack."
6144,"Tim Walz is live reacing for the first time to the statement on MSNBC and looks like he's going to cry with joy.

He knows. Trump is cooked."
6145,Dark Brandon sends his regards
6146,"""Also Hulk Hogan. For some reason.""


-Team Trump"
6147,Ggwp Maga better luck next time.
6148,We love our childless cat ladies!
6149,Seal the deal guys. Sign up to volunteer if you haven't https://go.kamalaharris.com/
6150,"Oh yeah, I think it’s pretty clear by this statement that they had this ready to go following the closing remarks tonight. Well played."
6151,"One-Two punch, what a night. My fear is quickly turning into joy and I don't know how this doesn't supercharge Democrats."
6152,"I think it’s an important lesson for young people that she waited. She said I watched the debate, and I’ve decided."
6153,"The Mahomes family is a maybe, but even Travis has shaded Trump over the years."
6154,It was really obvious Kelce was NOT a trump supporter lol.
6155,"If Harris wins, Biden saved this country."
6156,"Yeah that sure backfired like fuck on Trump, you can always count on him to to do the dumbest thing imaginable, but I was still shocked he actually did that"
6157,"If it ends up emphasizing the debate and how much better of a person Harris is, I will be super happy."
6158,JD Vance has done so much harm to Trump's campaign.
6159,Trumps over.   I won't get comfortable. But she has a massive fan base.
6160,I can just imagine his big ol goofy smile. Man I'm going to miss my governor.
6161,"Textbook example of good people. I happen to agree with him on every issue I've heard him speak about. However, if I didn't, he doesn't strike me as a person I couldn't still get along with. That's sorely missing in the modern political climate here."
6162,And so is Kamala.
6163,https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-see-tim-walz-react-live-219048005739
6164,"Aww they cut away right when she starts hyping him up specifically. I didn't need a reminder of what she looks like, I wanted to see him beaming!"
6165,Thank you!
6166,Amazing I teared up a little. Thank you!
6167,"It genuinely baffles me as an Australian that you have this bloke, one of the most warm and obviously electable chaps I've ever fucking seen come out of America, and then half the country are voting for a traitor who can only be described as the single greatest and historic embarassment that any American man ever had the unfortunate displeasure of not ending in a condom, at least until his Veep pick came along perhaps.

Kamala and Walz almost make me want to migrate to America, Trump makes me want to see the Pacific Ocean summon Godzilla to stop any American vessels from heading west to Australia"
6168,"Let the ""illegal eat"" him. He is Trumps pet, after all."
6169,"If Kamala Harris becomes president, you can bet for sure vance's political career is dead from here on out."
6170,It wouldn't be Walz without dropping a few truth bombs.
6171,A lot of execs and owners of ai companies have jumped on trumps team and became huge donors because he is their path to displacing the workforce with deregulated ai.  Vance is already on the record  for no regulations on ai
6172,"Don't forget that twitter had a load of AI 'Taylor Swift having sex with Kansas City Chiefs fans"" pictures circulated on it last year. It was at the height of NFL fans whining that she was giving their boys' game girl cooties.

She has plenty of reasons to be concerned about AI, and the people who use it."
6173,"Back around the super bowl, when republicans were claiming the entire NFL was conspiring to let the Chiefs win so Swift would have a more powerful platform to endorse Biden, someone posted a list of why trump was going to lose.  

I think #4 was something like, ""The polls are about even and Taylor Swift hasn't been activated yet.""

Activation, successful!"
6174,You KNOW he definitely wanted to take a commercial break and powwow with his kids
6175,I’m fucking giddy! wish I could see Trump’s reaction. Remember when he begged her not to endorse Biden at the Super Bowl?
6176,Taylor made the best endorsement of all time?
6177,"She has tremendous influence over the largest voting block. Women out vote men by about 10% in the younger demo’s. This especially cuts into his white vote, but it isn’t exclusive. 

Most importantly it’s mobilizing a very dedicated group of surrogates. Who understands social media on another level. If it’s a war in comment sections they want, they picked the wrong fight. 

Bad day all around."
6178,"Considering that the Kamala Harris website is now selling friendship bracelets, it was clearly planned in advance. He knew exactly when it was coming, but he did play it off well."
6179,"He really thought “I haven’t talked to my VP pick about important issues” was a good answer. Bro was fuckin LOST out there, get him a map."
6180,"JD Vance, coffee runner"
6181,"""I don't talk to Vance.""

I mean I get it, I wouldn't want to either, but you picked him bud."
6182,He forget he wasn't debating biden for a while
6183,"Apparently he was pushed hard by Musk and Thiel. Party leaders wanted Rubio and Murdochs wanted Bergum.

Thiel got into Don Jr's ear and gave us this absolute gift."
6184,Don Jr. is the failson of a failson.
6185,This is my take as well lol. It's just too stupid to be real.
6186,What a world we live in that somehow Sarah Palin isn't the worst VP pick of all time.
6187,Imagine being the dumb motherfucker who created those AI Taylor Swift images and seeing what havoc you have wrought on your orange idol.
6188,"Not only that, but a picture from her Time Person of the Year cover"
6189,"Almost like Kamala telling people to attend a Trump rally (and damn was that a masterful trap; he forgot everything else he was saying and got frothing about his rallies). When people actually see both sides, it's pretty damn clear who to vote for."
6190,It was a good idea for her to make the inference that she did the research and came away from that fully on Harris/Walz’s side. Smart because it’s providing a counterpoint to all the bitter Trumpists who will complain that “she’s only endorsing Harris because she was being bullied online” or “she’s only endorsing her because she’s a woman.” It also makes her seem confident that her fans will come away impressed with Harris/Walz after they look into their platform.
6191,"""JD Vance, you've repeatedly attacked vice president Kamala Harris on her border policy. If you were to be elected as vice president, what actions would you take on immigration policy?""


""I don't know, whatever makes sense."""
6192,"If Trump clearly and decisively loses PA, he has virtually no paths left to win.

He cannot afford to lose GA/PA/NC. If I remember correctly, he needs all 3.

P.S. [https://vote.gov/](https://vote.gov/) - Pick a territory, and follow this step by step if you still need to register too. There is still time. [It's not too late, and you are not powerless!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jxO8g7q9VO3ZMAABcrvR7PMyX4Yl6dgIYhD3eRTKk1M/edit?gid=0#gid=0)"
6193,"“Alexa, play Look What You Made Me Do”"
6194,[removed]
6195,"This is why you know Trump and his team are all a bunch of idiots.

They picked a fight with Taylor Swift while making it perfectly easy for her to just play a reverse uno card and hit them back 100x worse, from a woman who despite being a nepo baby, actually is as successful as she is because she's smart, strategic and knows how to play her cards better than anyone else.

What the fuck did they think was gonna happen?"
6196,I love how she’s like “now’s not the time for it to be about my music”
6197,May JD Vance remain for Donald Trump the gun that keeps shooting feet.
6198,"I agree. 

Taylor Swift is mostly a savvy businesswoman, but she’s a savvy businesswoman is also a childless cat lady that has been brazenly misappropriated by the Trump campaign. Some things are personal for her."
6199,"I was about to say, ""Leave Britney alone!"""
6200,TLDR is Brittney Mahomes is the wife of Taylor’s Bf’s teammate and evidently a huge Trump supporter and Trump personally thanked her for supporting him at a rally and Taylor was pictured with her at the US Open this past weekend causing for rumors of “oh she must support Trump too if she’s still hanging with her”
6201,I think Patrick mahomes wife?
6202,The slow blade penetrates the shield
6203,"“I wanted ~~Cersei~~ Trump, to know it was me.”"
6204,Beautifully put. I came to say the same. That was fucking brutal lol.
6205,"""She twists the blade. He feels it."""
6206,I have a feeling her or her husband's PR teams will tell her to be quiet for a while. And I bet she'll listen since money would be at stake
6207,"Taylor is like 50% of the reason Brittany is famous. She will keep her mouth shut, if she has any intelligence."
6208,"I mean, they’re dating/married to people who are presumably friends with one another given how long they’ve been teammates.

We don’t always get to pick exactly who’s in our social group, that’s a problem regular people face sometimes, too.

I’m sure they’ll both be cordial with each other, at least publicly, because that’s what normal people do"
6209,Brittany is the definition of no skin in the game. Fascism is appealing to her sensibilities but if Kamala wins her life will change 0 percent.
6210,Fair enough
6211,Who is Brittany? Spears?
6212,I don't think this is a deal breaker. It's not like they don't know each others' political leanings beforehand.
6213,"Thank you, I was like “what does Brittany Spears have to do with any of this?”"
6214,Probably too busy trying to defend against the Ukrainians that invaded Russian soil. How the turn tables.
6215,"As explosions start happening more frequently in Moscow, it is inevitable that the ""soldiers"" working for the FSB typing troll comments will realize that once the internet trolling stops working, their next likely stop is the front lines.  I don't think they're retaining much talent these days."
6216,3 Mil
6217,"Mid millennial with a ton of Taylor fans as friends, most if not all were already voting for Kamala. I think she needs to galvanize gen Z"
6218,"While this is huge news for Kamala, you also have to keep in mind that a significant number of her followers are either not from the US or not old enough to vote.

I’m not going to pretend this isn’t a big deal, because it is, but let’s not get carried away."
6219,We’re coming out in to vote in our skinny jeans
6220,Yes! 53 year old Swiftie right here!!!!
6221,"https://registertovoteflorida.gov/home


Deadline in this case is 10/7, so best not wait for that.

Edit: Also, you can pre-register if you'll be 18 on election day."
6222,"It’s insane to me that anyone’s even questioning it. The second I saw the news, I was disappointed in myself because it was so obvious in retrospect. It’s such a shrewd move, politically and with respect to her own marketing/PR. 

People always say she’s so calculating and I always thought they were a bit paranoid, but damn, I may have been wrong!"
6223,Chappell Roan also endorsed this week and I am thinking it’s because voter registration will be a big topic of the VMAs.
6224,[deleted]
6225,"I actually had a theory back in 2016 that Trump, as a former registered Democrat, was actually out to destroy the Republican Party. It was a much more innocent time."
6226,Trump is terrified of this.  See his recent comments on the 25th amendment.
6227,"If that ever ends up being true, name the street outside Trump's prison cell after him. Couchfucker Blvd."
6228,"This answer was pure face palm. And then “if we come up with something better”

Clearly admitted they’ve been unable to come up with anything better than Obamacare."
6229,And unlike MAGA army you really don’t want to mess with Swifties.
6230,It is said that the Swifties would be the 3rd largest economy in the whole world if they were an independent country.
6231,How does it stack up against the allied K-Pop army?
6232,"She got them interested in football.  All NFL teams are seeing an increase of women and girls trying to learn the sport.

Swift will make them aware of what’s at stake. Young women will take an interest in politics because they are smart and know they need to get involved.0"
6233,It's Nice to Have a Friend
6234,"When you know the dumb Reddit comment is coming, but you still get choked up by the moment, Yep, that’s me right now."
6235,“And you deserve prison but you won’t get time!!!”
6236,Trump's campaign staffers currently desperately hoping he doesn't post some unhinged all caps rant on truth social about Swift.
6237,I feel that! Like.. “back in my day” she was a country singer!! What do you know about that T-Swizzle x T-Pain “Thug Story” song? Lmao
6238,100%. Trumps worst nightmare of Taylor finally speaking out is finally happening. It’s over imo
6239,Honestly I'm looking forward to the debate with Walz/Vance more than I was with tonight's. Vance is such a fucking unlikeable opportunist.
6240,Harris team immediately dropped friendship bracelet merch as well. This was well planned
6241,Seriously! Once I saw she did this I couldn’t stop smiling. It was like instant relief
6242,And he was in commercials encouraging people to get the latest Covid vaccine. No Trump supporter would do that.
6243,People really only call him one because they think he *looks* like a Trump supporter. White with the mustache he rocks at the beginning of the season.
6244,"Nah, Harris saved the country by beating Trump."
6245,It does and gives a shout out to Walz
6246,"Yeah I feel like this could legit put Harris over the finish line which sounds nuts, but TS’s reach is unreal"
6247,He brings it back to the “would you want to sit down and have a beer with him?” level of politics. Missed that a lot.
6248,Right? Whoever was the segment producer clearly doesn't watch reaction videos.
6249,"Technically he's Peter Thiel's pet, not Trump's."
6250,That's if they can get to him before RFK
6251,"(talking to his daughter)

""Hey honey! Does this mean I'm cool?"""
6252,"I bet they got ""love story"" on their playlist during family trips lol"
6253,"Believe it or not, almost half of her fans are men. I kept seeing people on Reddit bitch that she hadn’t done it yet. My response was she’s one of the best people at social media in the world. Over saturation of her politics will kill the impact so she’ll wait until the best possible moment to make the endorsement. And she dropped it right after the debate when all the news networks would have a lot of people watching knowing they would stop whatever they were doing to announce her endorsement. Her timing was *perfect*."
6254,“I asked JD and he told me to do whatever makes sense.”
6255,"You don’t understand. 

The VP only matters if it’s a democrat because democrats are incompetent so it takes two people to run a country. But when you’re as smart as trump, the vp doesn’t matter because every decision he makes is correct and doesn’t need advice. 

Or something."
6256,"""whatever coffee makes sense"""
6257,"He literally couldn’t look at her, didn’t say her name once"
6258,"Rubio would have been much smarter, thank god they're so stupid"
6259,The fact that Biden waited until Trump had committed to Vance before dropping out can't be underestimated. Joe ain't what he used to be but he still has stellar political instincts.
6260,"If I've learned one thing from the past 8 years, NOTHING is too stupid to be real."
6261,"Okay, good."
6262,Look what you made me do
6263,Release the ~~~hounds~~~ Swifties!
6264,"Which she accepted by [begging them to let her bring her cat](https://www.instagram.com/taylorswift/p/C0g87DEOmE6/?hl=en) to the photoshoot, haha. It didn't even occur to me that Vance's ""childless cat lady"" comment would be what pissed her off the most."
6265,Doing my part to ensure he loses in NC.
6266,"Fingers crossed for a Texas surprise! They have the dems, they just need them to vote."
6267,That sparks joy.
6268,"""Taylor's Bf's teammate"" is the fucking greatest way to refer to Mahomes I have ever heard. I want that on a Chiefs jersey with a 15."
6269,"Lol...it took me a minute to suss it out.  For a few minutes I was like, 'when did Britney Spears get a cat?'."
6270,If she had any intelligence she wouldn't be a trump supporter
6271,"The crazy part is - until Trump - differing political parties could be friends. Even with W. Bush - you could still relate. 

Trump and his message struck too deep to personal beliefs. The kind where “I can’t be friends with you, if you believe this way.” I’ve lost more friends during Trumps presidency that I ever had prior. 

The worst part is - the damage is done. I now know that’s what they desire in their heart. We’re just diametrically opposed to one another politically."
6272,"Her life will probably get better actually, with the stability of a Harris presidency. Also when they shoot off to far away places they won't get shit for being American."
6273,I don’t get her. She’s married to a black man but votes for Trump? A guy who was sued for not letting black people rent? Who questioned Obama’s legitimacy? I mean why?
6274,"This is the only Britney I recognize, too. But they mean Patrick Mahomes' wife, the biggest celebrity Trump can possibly get."
6275,"Respectfully, it’s Britney bitch."
6276,"You think they'd put more effort in. If Trump doesn't win and help end the war by stopping funding to Ukraine, the Russians will he handed a slingshot and sent to Kiev. 

Surely there is motivation there."
6277,"Dang, and it's midnight on a Tuesday on the east coast. It's going to keep climbing in the morning once the Swifties wake up.

Edit: 3.5 million as of now."
6278,The guy above you was being generous with 1 in 200. At least 1 in every 200 of her followers is both over 18 and lives in the US.
6279,"Sure, some of her fans are kids, but I think you're overestimating how many. Taylor got famous at what, 18 or 19? She's 34 now. An 18 year old today would have been just 3 when she released ""you belong with me"" and ""love story"". These came out when I was in 8th grade. They were wildly popular among girls in my grade, and some guys too, though I imagine many eighth grade boys wouldn't admit it. She was standard wedding dance music just about right away, which would imply she has long-term fans currently in their 40s.

All this is very theoretical. On a more personal and concrete level, I know people in their 60s and 70s that are into her"
6280,You best believe I’ll be casting my vote with some avocado toast and a PSL right next to me
6281,People CAN be calculating AND nice people.  Sometimes.
6282,And now we just need K-POP bands to start coming out in Kamala merch
6283,"As a Gen Xer, I appreciate the Swiftie army. They are loyal, and they will destroy anyone who stands it their way. They know how to coordinate large-scale campaigns. Plus, they add unexpected elements of surprise with their vendettas. "
6284,"I look forward to Trump's *inevitable* series of crude insults about Taylor Swift, because the backlash will be so sweet."
6285,The Popstar equivalent of NATO is yuge!!!
6286,"As a confederation the K-Pop Stans probably outnumber Swifties, but there is considerable infighting amongst the factions and thus they aren’t united behind a single force in the same way, so Swifties probably take it."
6287,"they have live threads to watch games LOL, it's so cute. I heard that some people from the NFL sub join them because they are friendlier. (I am not a swiftie or an NFL fan, but as a phenomenon it's so fun)"
6288,"Lord of the Rings has taught all of us that fighting an oppressive force is not only the right move, but sometimes the only move."
6289,“The bullet had just grazed”
6290,"That collab was amazing, we need another one. T-Pain is a treasure and I'm glad he's getting a positive light on him now after people hated on his popularization of Autotune, but the man can genuinely sing, is a fantastic producer, and he seems to be enjoying life with streaming video games and drifting cars."
6291,That one might be a bigger beat down than tonight was. JD Vance is a poser with no integrity or mind of his own.
6292,And her concerts in Miami are the days immediately preceding the start of Florida’s early voting. 
6293,Which absolutely DELIGHTED him when Rachel Maddow read the tweet while they were talking. It was charming.
6294,Tim Walz doesn’t drink alcohol. Which as a fellow non-drinker I think is badass. However I would be happy to sit down to share a Shirley Temple with him!
6295,"I noticed kamala's campaign had merch ready to drop for it as well. I imagine there was some coordination. 

Probably a great time for it:

Debate goes well: capitalize on the momentum with millions watching.

Debate goes poorly: blunt the impact of that by changing the topic to the Swift endorsement."
6296,"Okay, good"
6297,"He tried to get out of shaking her hand too, what a spineless crybaby"
6298,"To quote an unknown Ukrainian hero:

**""We are very lucky that they [russians] are so fucking stupid.""**"
6299,It couldn't have been Rubio. They needed someone from somewhere other than Florida 
6300,I don't know if it was planned but dropping out after they had spent their entire convention harping on the wrong guy was brilliant!
6301,"“ I’ve got concepts for a plan” had me feeling that way, among many others."
6302,Whatever makes sense
6303,"Send Robinson and Trump both home packing and crying, friend!"
6304,I’m doing my part to ensure he doesn’t win Kentucky… by what’s expected! But I can hope
6305,"Colin Allred is the rep in my district, I've been pulling for him for a long time.

He's been great for us, and I'd love to have him replace Cruz more than just about anything, especially if he helps us keep the Senate.

But man, Texas turning blue would also be brilliant. Harris rocked it with tonight's debate, no doubt."
6306,"Even though I read ""Brittany Mahomes"" the ""Taylor's Bf's teammate"" line still had my high brain thinking ""must be Harrison Butker's wife"""
6307,There are fundamental values I thought the vast majority of us shared and it was pretty shaking to realize how many didn't feel the same way. It really made me reflect on how we got here and why. It's pretty depressing knowing how many people were happy and willing to go to these lengths.
6308,I didn’t think it through that far but your completely right.
6309,"A lot of NFL players vote Republican because they think it's better for their bank balances. I remember reading about Bart Scott being a very vocal Democrat supporter and irritating his teammates by trying to convince them they should vote Democrat because it would be better for the communities they grew up in.

But a lot of players also come from small, conservative towns where being Republican is as much part of the identity as being Christian and playing football."
6310,"Putin at this point has probably done pretty much the same thing that Stalin did from the 1930's and onward - everyone that was intellectual, pragmatic, charismatic or had the ability to be a usurper was disappeared, and no one left is crafty and beguiling enough to affect great change to anything inside or outside of Russia."
6311,"Uh, yeah, lots of fans in their 40s. 

Source: my wife and many of her friends. 

But to be honest, they were never going to vote for Trump in a million years and were already motivated to vote. Where I hope this makes a difference is encouraging younger voters to register and get out when they are more likely to sit it out."
6312,Low cut socks! (am I doing this right?)
6313,Add in the gay furries and this shits a lock.
6314,"It has created an all inclusive community. I’m a man in his mid-50s. While I’m not a Swiftie, I am a father to wonderful daughters. When they come in the room ask “what is a cover 2 defense?” After YEARS of pretending I was dead(while watching football) it broke me as a man. 
Ms. Swift seems happy with her NFL star and I think everyone wins because of it."
6315,"""washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things"""
6316,Did not know that also over a year sober here and this makes me happy and like him even more
6317,"If you watch the post-debate talk, they interviewed JD and asked him about abortion. They asked if he spoke to Trump about it, and he said no he hasn't spoken to him about it and there's no need to. Seems like they don't even talk to each other lol."
6318,Lmao he just stopped in the corner and she walked right up to him
6319,I love that calling Russians stupid in the quote still directly relates to the GOP shitstorm
6320,"This one still gets me, because it was a sentence that was just *so* out of place that it felt like he literally did not know what he was doing at all.  That could have actually been a good moment with just a little rephrasing.  Something along the lines of ""what do you recommend?"" would show a human connection. ""I'll try your most popular flavors"", or just asking people there ""hey, what sounds good?  I'll go with that"" would make it look from the outside like he had the ability to connect with people.  But he had to say the most alien, robotic thing imaginable."
6321,That is certainly the plan! I am genuinely insulted that the republicans want these hate filled monsters to run this country/state. I won't fucking stand for it anymore.
6322,"For good measure, let's get Jeff Jackson in as Attorney General. He's good people."
6323,Im doing my part too! Fucking awful we have someone as dogshit as Robinson running here
6324,"Honestly, red state votes still matter. Each time you shrink their margins and vote Dems at the local level, you weaken the GOP's ability to take control of your lives and harm your community.

Breaking their majorities makes it easier to protect future elections, counter gerrymandering, get abortion ballots out in future elections, or do whatever else is necessary.

Never, ever believe your vote does not matter. Far too many people in red states fall for that lie. Your vote will always matter, even if it's just in one or 2 of the local races. This applies in blue states too. Many of them have crucial house swing districts that can help give us back the House or protect our senate majority."
6325,Gay furries could release all the GOP’s secrets with just a few keystrokes. 
6326,"I am also a mid-50s father of an 11-year-old girl who is a huge Swift fan.  She isn't interested in football (""It looks painful.""), but she does want to see Swift on the screen at the game when it's broadcast.

The CRAZY part is my father (in his 80s) has become a Taylor Swift fan (plays her music in the car) to connect with his granddaughter.  Every time we visit on Sunday for family dinner, he and she talk about the latest Swift news (with my 40-something sister).  He's suddenly so into it he took a Swift quiz and scored only one point behind my daughter!

(Now, if I could get him to stop watching endless YouTube videos about Swift/Kelce/ErasTour on his tablet, my mom would be very happy, too.)"
6327,"😭😭😭

that's so heartwarming. I'm a woman and my dad was mine and my sister's softball coach for many many years when we were children and as a family we always watched baseball and went to games together. dad/daughter sports bonding is so special!! I'm so happy for y'all, I love hearing stories like this."
6328,"this is so sweet, so glad you have this connection as well with your daughters <3"

6337,"69% of Trump supporters said the former president won.  Those same people likely compose like 35 of the 37% that overall say that Trump won the debate. 

How you could have watched that festering meltdown and thought ""yeah, Trump did a good job"" is absolutely beyond me.  Bias aside, last night was just objectively not a good night for Trump.

6340,"Wow, normally I wouldn't share any articles from Fox, but even when they're forced to report that their candidate was thoroughly defeated in the debate, you know Trump must have done *awful*. The bar was so low for Trump, and even then he couldn't clear it. 

Yesterday was a fantastic night for Harris with her evisceration of Trump in the debate and Taylor Swift endorsing her immediately afterwards. I hope this is the beginning of her lead growing in the polls until Election Day finally comes."

6356,Holy shit. That comment section is unhinged.
6357,"But did it sway voters, highly unlikely. The 3 undecided voters CNN asked before and after the debate said it did nothing to help their decision. Both lied and only one has a good track record with the economy and it isn't Kamala. Take the Covid debacle out if it and Trump's economy was better, 500k manufacturing jobs created. Kamala/Biden years 10 million illegals, record high inflation, energy cost at record highs. Most Americans aren't sitting on Reddit acting like fan boys for the Democrats, they are working and trying to live, they vote with their wallets not their feelings."
6358,"I don’t know… I’m a Democrat but I thought Harris came off phony and nearly all her answers sounded like a rehearsed speech. I think voters are tired of hearing “let me be clear” every 5 mins. She sounded like a politician, like Hillary but worse - he sounded off-the-cuff and real (though insane at times). Her plan got into some specifics, but felt more like Build Back Better 2.0. Towards the second half she warmed up and gave some great genuine responses, like on healthcare. But it wasn’t as strong as I would have liked.

She didn’t do a great job responding to Trump’s lies - she would instead just launch into her own speech. ABC rightfully fact-checked Trump multiple times but their choice of questions showed a clear bias against Trump. I hope voters don’t sympathize with Trump because of this.

Bottom line, there are undecided voters in swing states who are highly concerned about the economy and border - I wish Harris would’ve done a better job assuaging those concerns instead of letting Trump falsely blame her for everything and then not shutting him down."
6359,"The MAGA morons were going to say Trump won no matter what.

6360,"> 69% of Trump supporters said the former president won.

Anything under 90% from that reality-allergic crowd is red alert."
6361,69% of a cult thinks their cult leader won. That is a really bad number for Trump

6363,69% of Trump supporters actually seems quite low given their fanaticism.
6364,"The fact that 31% of trump supporters didn't think he won is actually pretty impressive, given their abject rejection of reality..."
6365,That’s the same group of people that think immigrants are eating dogs in Springfield and that after birth abortions are a thing. So it’s not surprising.
6366,"It's performative and they know it. Trump could literally have eaten a piece of shit on stage last night and they would declare he is the greatest debater in the history of mankind. They say what they want to be true, they don't use language like a normal human. They are weird, they act weird, and declaring your own reality against your own eyes and ears is fucking weird."
6367,Because they believe in all that racist bullshit he was yelling about last night. My dad  believes the Aurora story and I'm sure he believes Haitians are eating pets.

6369,"Harris clearly won the debate but Trump avoided directly insulting her for the most part and avoided falling completely apart like he did on the childcare interview question, I was hoping to see more of that.  He could have done a lot worse.  He has never been good at debates, his opponents have not generally handled him very well and she did."

5. Take back Congress. 

6. Bring back abortion protections. 

7. Make more progress towards reasonable gun control. 

8. Don’t let Putin conquer Ukraine. 

9. Tax the rich instead of giving them more trillions in tax cuts.

6391,">Take the Covid debacle out if it and Trump's economy was better...

Not really how it works since he fucked up the response. Not to mention, if you remove covid from the equation you also get rid of the inflation and high energy costs that you blame on Biden as well as the initially sluggish economy. Trump also got with OPEC to slash production in 2020 in order to drive up prices and prop up domestic fracking. Can't have it both ways. All of this is pretty much on Trump.

https://www.reuters.com/article/economy/special-report-trump-told-saudi-cut-oil-supply-or-lose-us-military-support--idUSKBN22C1V3/

>500k manufacturing jobs created...

Many of which vanished during covid and have since returned (and then some) under Biden. The manufacturing sector was also in a recession throughout 2019 under Trump before covid even happened.

https://www.reuters.com/article/economy/u-s-manufacturing-dives-to-10-year-low-as-trade-tensions-weigh-idUSKBN1WG4IU/

>10 million illegals...

Is it 10? Is it 20? Is it 50? I've heard all three from conservatives. Based on everything else you've said and been wrong about, I think all three numbers are likely exaggerated and include people seeking asylum, not simply people crossing illegally.

Good try, though."
6392,"> only one has a good track record with the economy and it isn't Kamala

Trump's economy was a total failure. He inherited Obama's booming economy and then destroyed it with his mishandling of Covid. His tariffs certainly didn't help:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_administration_farmer_bailouts

> Take the Covid debacle out if it and Trump's economy was better, 500k manufacturing jobs created

If you take Covid out of Biden's economy, he did better! People have calculated that Biden's economy has beaten expectations. Manufacturing, infrastructure - Trump could only dream of it.

> 10 million illegals, record high inflation, energy cost at record highs.

10 million illegals is a right wing lie (the real number is 0.5 million). Inflation is a global problem and is under control now (<3%). Energy costs are also under control and it is funny that people want Covid fuel prices. Do they want global lockdowns, global shortages?"
6393,"What a crock of shit. She should look composed and rehearsed.  
  
Have you been totally warped by Trump for what a good debate performance is?   
  
She did what you want someone to do."
6394,He said the hateful things they wanted to hear and felt heard.
6395,"Friend of mines right leaning. He 100% thought Haitians were eating people's pets because of a viral tiktok video. I sent him links proving that's not the case to which he conceded. An hour later, Trump was talking about Haitians eating pets. The propaganda is real and wide spread."
6396,"If he had dropped trou and literally taken a shit on the stage, his cult would say it's a brilliant, alpha move. 

Cultists gonna cult."
6397,[deleted]
6398,31% of Trump supporters said the former president lost.
6399,"Nah, man. I like Biden, but he lost. Sure, you can argue Biden offered better answers when he was able to complete his train of thought, because of course he did. Trump never has solid answers, just lies. But that’s not really what presidential debates are measured on. It’s a performance. A show. Who seems more presentable, poised, confident, and strong. Substance only starts to matter if those things are near equal between the competitors. And Biden came off lost and weak. But the biggest proof he lost is that he is no longer running for president. Debate winners don’t get forced out of the race."
6400,"14. Reasonable guns laws (hopefully soon, my son starts school in 3 years, no one should be scared to send their children to school, someone’s right to own a firearm should not supersede a parents right to send their kid to school safely)"
6401,Those messages are especially puzzling when you consider they’re directed to a forum of left-leaning political enthusiasts.
6402,"Thank you for your service to our democracy. Truly.

Even if one can’t make the time to volunteer, you can also help by talking to people (ie. family, friends, neighbors, coworkers, etc) about the debate, Trump’s lies, reproductive rights, Project 2025, making sure they register and are ready. Word of mouth can make a HUGE difference, especially in smaller communities. 

Heck, even donating to the Harris Campaign by buying a tshirt and yard sign makes a huge difference. Keeping the election top of mind with as many people as possible is what will drive people to the polls, fme.

We can all play a part."
6403,I also hate when they try to guilt people into donating money. Not everyone can do that.
6404,I am doing all of the things I'm asking others to do. One thing I'm *not* doing is trying to start fights with other Democrats. Have a nice day!
6405,"We do. The original comment has it:

*this is pleasing**…

They acknowledge the good news but keep the same tone “do not get complacent”. Vigilance is victory, so they are simply saying to remain vigilant, even when receiving good news.

You’re getting unnecessarily hostile. It’s good that you are doing your part, but this isn’t some litmus test for loyalty.

We all understand the assignment and our roles in it, no need to act superior to people."
6406,"The reason it’s not getting more attention is because his base agrees and parrots it constantly because they believe his salesman tactic of “this is broken and I’m the only one who can fix it”. And for everyone else, he’s been saying that and similar stuff for years. We’ve grown numb."
6407,every day we stray further from god's light.
6408,Anyone can spot a pivot. It's just a thing politicians do when they know a direct answer would hurt them. The important thing is how they pivot. Do they talk about policies and proposals relevant to the subject that might appeal to swing voters? Or do they go off the rails like a crazy person? 
6409,"Well he was a raging dipshit that was talking about eating pets, and crowd sizes, praising dictators and getting called out for obvious lies.  You don't need to be tuned in to notice the obvious."
6410,"I don't think Trump had a good debate performance either, but he continued his crusade of trying to make Harris look responsible for Covid-era inflation, and Harris launched into her own pre-prepared speeches instead of shutting him down.

In the end, she needs to convince voters in the battleground states that she will make their lives better than Trump will. I'm not sure she did that."
6411,B-b-but I like his ~~racism~~ policies!
6412,I’d be a little impressed tbh.
6413,His hands may also be too small for a proper arm fart.

6416,"A sane swing voter would see the debate, see the polls, and come to the conclusion that the base is actually insane and would not be a good fit to run the country. 

My head in my hands knowing it's not that simple."
6417,"Absolutely true. Although, I hope people realize that the *number* of donations is important, too, and that a $5 donation contributes that way as much as a $500 one."
6418,"Of course. You can only do what you can, so do the best you can!"
6419,"I hope you have a great day, too, and thanks!"
6420,"Sincere apologies if I came across as trying to be superior. I just get tired of reading the same comment in every good news post. Everyone who visits this sub knows they need to vote, but it gets said hundreds of times a day."
6421,Wait til you hear about his pale purple flapjack ass
6422,"Because more often than not it does nothing to directly address trumps lies.   
  
I still contend your point is warped by how the medias handled Trump.  
  
Harris killed it."
6423,B-b-but I like his ~~racism~~ ~~policies~~ concept of policies!*
6424,Probably racial policies
6425,"You know, now that you mention it, I would give him more credit for that than the steaming turd we got instead."
6426,"Nobody arm farts better than him. Many people are saying it. They come up to him, tears in their eyes, saying ""Sir, you have the best arm farts out of all arm farters ever."""
6427,"Only if those 31 percent don’t follow it up with, “I don’t care, still voting for him”."
6428,"Yeah, people should present it in more creative ways. It just sounds like parroting coupled with no sign of anything THAT person has done it seems pretty preachy for no reason."
6429,"Nonsense. I had to watch for 4 years as that man got up on podiums and said whatever he wanted, and never once was he forced to substantiate his claims. He knows that if you say a lie enough times, people will believe it. More people need to not allow him to do that.

I've seen great debaters. Obama's performances in 2008 and 2012 were downright inspiring. Harris is not a great debater. Hopefully it works out in November, but I'm nervous. She gives off politician energy and people are struggling right now."
6430,The best he could manage is probably those high-pitched squeaky farts
6431,"You could probably ask that 31% ""Did him losing the debate make you more or less likely to vote for him?"" and they would to an individual say ""more likely""."
6432,Cool. Great opinion. Happy for you.
6433,"They already are making excuses for his performance. Biased moderators is the big one, but I have also seen them claiming that Harris was wearing earrings that are actually earpieces with Obama telling her what to say. You know you're in deep cognitive dissonance territory when your apologetics dive into conspiracy theory levels of batshit."

6435,"A two-fer, with a message to Polish-Americans voting in battleground Pennsylvania."
6436,Putin has already stated this.
6437,"What struck me about the whole Russia/Ukraine conversation was that Trump is incapable of saying anything bad about Russia or Putin.  He wouldn't say he wants Ukraine to win the war, he would only say he wants the war to end.  He wouldn't say Russia was wrong to invade, he said our NATO allies were taking advantage of us.  He didn't say Putin needed to be defeated, he said Putin needed to be capitulated to because he has nuclear weapons.

And then there was the weird thing about Victor Orban.  Trump's values are clearly more aligned with Russia's than with the west."
6438,"Can I just say how impressive it is that she memorized the 800k Polish Pennsylvanians stat in preparation for the debate? I mean, maybe she also memorized the number of Ukrainians living in Pennsylvania, and that would be shrewd enough, but no, she took it a step further and linked defending Ukraine -> defending Poland -> 800k Polish Pennsylvanians. That's thinking multiple chess moves in advance. It's high level strategic thinking. I was awestruck when she pulled that out and I don't think it's getting enough coverage."
6439,"Lots of people of Polish descent in the upper Midwest (Michigan, Wisconsin). Hopefully they’re paying attention to this."
6440,Her Pole numbers are going up?
6441,Poland has read the writing on the wall and has beefed up its military.  They have been buying up every kind of US or South Korean military equipment.  They are also building Patriot systems in Poland.
6442,"Poles make up a surprising amount of the population in many swing states, her team knows this and purposely used them as an example.

Feels good to have a competent campaign with a candidate that is coherent and able to deliver a message again."
6443,That’s why she said it. It’s almost as if she prepared extensively and has a lot of experience with this or something.
6444,"I lived in Poland in the summer of 2023 and I can tell you that this MORE than resonates with the Polish people. It was constantly a subject of conversation when they learned I was American. I even had the opportunity to be in Vilnius the day before the NATO Summit which was quite the experience! Also, Vilnius is an amazing city!"
6445,"I'm born and raised in the US, and living in Warsaw the last 8 years. 

Poles used to LOOOOOVE Conservative Americans. There are monuments and streets named for Reagan, Gen. MacArthur, Gen. Patton, etc. And there's only one good reason. 

They were Cold Warriors against the USSR. There's a standard joke in Poland that explains how they feel about Russia. 

Polish sniper is told there are two targets he can hit. One a German soldier, one a Russian. He's asked which one he will take first.

The German. 

Why?

Business before pleasure.

Polish people here finally voted out there own insane right-wing leaders. They know and hate Orban. And they haaaaaaaaaate Putin. In my upper-class neighborhood I can find three cars with bumper stickerst that say ""jebac Putin"" (fuck Putin). And that's not even including the 10% of the population that is CIS refugees (former USSR, Belarus and a LOT of Ukrainians). 

Poles now know if Trump wins, Ukraine loses and we are next. And they will tell their Fox-watching Cocias and Wujeks in the US that they damn well better pull the lever for Kamala. 

Don't piss off a Pole. It only makes him happy to be angry, and he will gladly die before letting you win. 

Gratulacje, Drumpf. You just pissed off 50 million people worldwide who LIVE to hold a grudge."
6446,"I personally first worry for Moldova.

Poland certainly as well; even Romania as well. 

No Eastern European nation is free from Russian threat. 



Its also historically simple; (thanks Chat GbT) ""appeasement."" It involves making concessions to an aggressive power to avoid conflict, often by giving in to some of their demands. A prominent example of this policy is the Munich Agreement of 1938, where British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French leaders agreed to allow Nazi Germany to annex the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia in hopes of preventing a larger war.""




Putin wants this, putin wants that. Give it to him; he will undoubtedly ask for more and when denied make further threats."
6447,There have been celebrations in Poland today due to that comment being in the debate. Poland is deadly serious about the threat of Russian expansion.
6448,"That was a 4D chess move for sure. Discussing the threat of Russia, Putin’s ability to walk all over Trump, and tying it all together to a large untapped voting block in one of the most crucial swing states. 

Masterclass. *chef’s kiss*"
6449,"Putin won’t stop until he is stopped. That’s what happened in Ukraine, and Trump laid the groundwork for it with his attempted extortion - illegal and embarrassing activity which Republicans didn’t even punish."
6450,"Russia has already targeted Poland. They've targeted every single nation in Europe. It's asymmetrical warfare, they are using hackers, spies, assassins, and more to destabilize the world. They have zero vision for their country other than burning down the world. No wonder they have the support of conservatives."
6451,"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/harris-suggested-that-russia-could-target-poland-if-ukraine-loses-the-war-that-resonates-with-poles) reduced by 81%. (I'm a bot)
*****
> If Ukraine loses, Putin &quot;Will take further steps,&quot; said Kwiatkowska, a 75-year-old resident of Warsaw whose Ukrainian mother and Polish father met after World War II. She was particularly dismissive of Trump&#039;s claim in Tuesday night&#039;s debate that he could easily end the war.

> &quot;Just empty words,&quot; she scoffed, pulling a grocery cart as she did her morning shopping in Warsaw, a capital that, like cities in Ukraine today, was bombed to near destruction during World War II. S?awomir D?bski, a professor of strategy and international affairs at the College of Europe in Natolin, also found it &quot;Far-fetched&quot; for Trump to claim he could force Putin and Ukraine&#039;s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the negotiating table before he even entered the White House.

> With the brutal war in Ukraine, many Poles have soured on Trump, who has a history of admiring comments about Putin.

6452,If they were paying attention they’d already know. It’s not a big leap.
6453,It’s also a simple fact of empire building. Trump refuses to acknowledge the importance of Allie’s.
6454,Trump would welcome his brothers and sisters in the bolshevik cause to invade Poland since he is a commie pinko
6455,Putin's about to Pokemon Go to the Poles
6456,She’s got the Pole position
6457,"So.... She get a boost with the poles?

Sorry. I'll show myself out."
6458,"Sure it resonates with Poles, but will it resonate with polls?"
6459,"It can resonate with whoever but if it doesn’t resonate with 51% of “PaWiNevMiAzGaNc” (as Jon Stewart called it), then it doesn’t mean anything."
6460,Invading Poland resonates with Poles suggests Polls
6461,"We already know this, wdym it ""resonates with us"" ?"
6462,"4-dimensional chess there, she'd get even more Polish votes if she offered us some F-22s"
6463,"If Russia is struggling with Ukraine who’s fighting with two hands tied behind their back, they aren’t making it to Poland."
6464,We have pro-Russian facists in Poland too .
6465,"I hope the headline is true, but I doubt it. Many Polish-Americans don't have that many connections with Poland anymore, most don't even speak Polish well enough to follow what's happening in Poland or what actual Polish people think, and many of them are the prime Trump demographic (white working class).

For a lot of them, the fact that Trump is proposing high tariffs on foreign countries will be a lot more appealing because that might bring back some working class jobs than the fact that Trump will screw over Ukraine, which will in turn screw over Poland."
6466,"I don't know much about Polish Americans and how much it resonates with them (they are not homogenous, of course, although in the older generations, there was an overwhelming overrepresentation of conservatives), but as a Pole from Poland, there's a real fear that Trump may dismantle NATO. It feels like never in history has the election in the USA been so important not only for Americans but also for Europe and the entire world."
6467,"Come on, Russia couldn't even handle Ukraine before the West started to aid them.

It would look bad if another European country was invaded by Russia while Biden or Harris are in office."
6468,I suspect that Putin will attack the Baltic states first if he achieves a 'peace settlement' in Ukraine.
6469,"First of all - most people here know the difference between us and Ukraine - we are secured by NATO. That whole ""you are next regardless"" is just a standard line to try and get us dragged into that war alone, without the rest of alliance so the countries already slacking-off with their support could end it and fully pull out. Nothing less nothing more.

And in that case - a shameless vote grab on top of it - no less than that visa BS Trump Has done back in his time.

So that dont just ""resonate"" with us, the mere thought that anyone would concider selling us off to Russia or even states that's a possible scenario, thus normalising it - is more than enough to make everyones blood boil.


West or to be more precise - USA and UK did partake im de-nuclearisation of Ukraine. That treaty lead 
tothe total guarantee of its territorial integrity at the cost of giving away its soviet-inherited nuclear arsenal together with means of its utilisation. Arsenal in the scale of thousands of warheads. Effectively enough to turn ANY country into 3rd WORD POWER within a span of hours. Today, taking into concideration the abysmally low rates of readyness/operation-worthy means of atomic warfare it would essentialy be enough to put any country on equal or advantageous grounds with current atomic superpowers.

Treason against Ukraine would put into question every deal ever made with US/UK as simply none was cemented by any commitment even close to that magnitude. Not even NATO, at least it didn't need to - so far. That is the outcome that could be a direct danger to Poland, setting NATO as no less of a farse and one sided alliance than the CSTO that refused to come and protect its member during Nagorno-karabah offensive cus Russia saw its own war as more important and the other members as expendable. 

That is the main danger. Not Russia being able to take on NATO if it cant deal with Ukraine supported by a few % of NATO military budget. Its just a tankie daydream, not worth the time nor effort to take seriously.

Such treason would prove one thing above every smooth talk or empty guarantees - that the atomic weapons are the only thing effective at preventing a war reliably. And I guess we dont want that to be the message for the world."
6470,"poles are like fantasy dwarfs, they holding a grudge to the grave and are happy to be angry. And they have two books of grudges, second one for Russia only"
6471,"Poles are racists, misogynists and Catholics. I'm a Polish American living in Queens, NY and I am the only person among Poles here who  won't vote for Trump."
6472,Resonates with Poles and polls
6473,"Honestly we should kick Poland out of NATO, too much of a risk."
6474,What does that have to do with America
6475,"Nearly 800,000 polish people in PA, like Harris’ mention of McCain resonating in AZ, her responses were artful in not only many of her answers, but how they targeted folks in swing States"
6476,As a Polish-American voter who lives in said battle ground state I can confirm that her message hit deep. I hope it did with others as well.
6477,"Yup.  Remind them of Trump's efforts to hollow out NATO.  Then remind them that, after NATO protection is diminished, he'd likely let Putin waltz right in."
6478,A population that otherwise leans conservative.
6479,"This is absolutely no surprise to anyone who has some acquaintance with Russian history. Not terribly familiar with Russian history, but some very basic understanding, is all that's necessary."
6480,"Agree, I’m surprised his comments don’t receive more media attention."
6481,"Which seems odd to me that a pathological liar, couldn’t just say, yeah I want Ukraine to win."
6482,"That's why he was opposed to gas prom and told Germans to stop buying gas and other stuff from Russians?
He wouldn't be doing that if Russians had dirt on him or whatever the people in the replies are suggesting.

Yeah the lack of a closure from him is weird but you guys are either forgetting some facts or deliberately ignoring them."
6483,"Putin made such a big impression on Trump that Trump said Russia didn't interfere in the 2016 election, contrary to the research of U.S. intelligence agencies like the FBI and others. Because the night before Putin said it to Trump with confidence. 

I suspect that Trump has not forgotten this and admires Putin."
6484,he’s Putin’s dog for god’s sake. Russian asset
6485,"And she connected three generations of financial needs she plans to support: $6000 child tax credit, $25,000 for first time home buyers, and $50,000 for upstart small business. She had mentioned all these before, but not as tight and cohesive as during the debate. Her prep paid off. I learned more than I thought I would."
6486,"I’ll preface with I am voting for Harris.

The only reason that impresses you is because we’ve had 8 years of literal nursing home residents leading the free world.

Memorizing statistics SHOULDNT be hard for the President. I EXPECT my presidents to operate at that level and I am thrilled that we finally have one again."
6487,"While I agree it's impressive and by no means want to belittle that, can I just say that it feels kind of sad that it has become impressive? That Trump and politicians like him have lowered the bar so much that a debate where a candidate showed they studied the constituents and issues that mattered is considered impressive.

Her debate prep was on point and really showed Trump the meaning of competence."
6488,"Me too. I myself grew up in Missourah and Oklahoma, but my wife is Polish-American from outskirts of Philly (Manayunk).  There are a LOT of 2nd, 3rd, or 4th generation Polish-Americans in Philly, including my wife's very extended family. 

My maternal side were Swede-Finns from Mass, but I can see why Harris didn't throw the Finns a bone.  Too few in the US--they're too busy in Finland being #1 in happiness and raking forests (maybe the two are correlated)."
6489,"Not surprising, considering that there are far more Polish-Americans than Ukrainian-Americans."
6490,I’m te pretty ordinary with sides especially
6491,"Crazy how American politics have come down to if that impresses you. I’m my country (Portugal), in political debates the candidates are expected to know these kinds of stats and numbers, it’s not something impressive."
6492,Bro please thats just basic thinking😭 the glazing is honestly insane
6493,This way of thinking about voting in America is very offputing from the outside
6494,Stahhhp!😂
6495,"For local construction as well

And domestic Polish equipment as well, feels odd not to mention bc there’s quite a lot of it"
6496,"I'm of Polish, Jewish, and Russian ancestry. I grew up well aware that Poland has been smacked around by surrounding powers including Russia. Never again."
6497,"I’m polish and honestly this comes from the national trauma of “western betrayal” during WWII - more specifically relying on foreign alliances and assurances that ended up being for naught. 

From our perspective, Brits and French stood by and watched as we were obliterated from both sides by Germans and Russians. 

Now, say what you will about US foreign policy, but part of the reason Poland is so pro-American is that the US isn’t afraid to flex its military muscle and project power worldwide. The US was seen as just what we need - a strong, reliable ally that will not throw us under the bus but stand and fight instead.

This is also why Poland and Americans of Polish descent were historically leaning republican - dems used to prefer cozying up to Russia and seeking “resets” while republicans had a much more russorealistic approach. Having a republican administration in the US just made sense to us from a security standpoint.

The war in Ukraine showed the US is the only reliable ally we have (Western Europe, especially Germans were extremely sluggish to respond and did so only after essentially being forced to do so by Poland and the Baltics - had they not it would’ve possibly ended the EU).

Trump in the White House means we’re pretty much on our own again and we lose a reliable ally against Russian aggression. Trump being on Putins payroll will flip a lot of Polish Americans dem."
6498,"Yup, Poles are basically Warhammer Dwarfs

Grudges, revanchism, and unending hate for orcs"
6499,"I am Polish and that grudge is real. For the past 1000 years we were either in the close neighborhood or bordering Russia. Imagine having a neighbor who will fuck you over any chance they get for a freaking MILLENNIUM, including - but not limitied to - multiple partitions, occupations and ethnic cleansing. And then the rest of the world will only see a 'brotherly quarrel"" because your languages are kind of similiar (but not enough to hold any kind of conversation other than ""screw you"" and ""screw you too"").  Imagine everyone else telling you that you and your neighbor are basically twins, disregarding 1000 years of having different alphabet, religion, architecture, culture, governing systems, and experiences. Then the neighbor calls you an agressive brute for disliking them for no reason at all."
6500,"People just repeat things about the previous government without knowing ay thing about them.

There wasn’t that much “crazy” about them and they weren’t rlynexaclty  right wing in the US sense"
6501,"Poland didn’t have “insane right-wing leaders” lol

It is an anemic neoliberal centre-right and purely vindictive government now

And previously it was an odd sort of government with actually quite dedenrlt centre-left economic policies

Massive amounts of hot air bc a lot of private media  etc. type peopel hates them"
6502,"Yup, it moght go Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Baltics, Finland, and then Poland. Putin would want to break NATO on his first strike. So I could see him going for countries Americans don’t know about and then new NATO members to weaken French resolve"
6503,"You're 100% right. When the war in Ukraine is brought up and Trump immediately starts talking about how big and scary Russia's nukes are and how he would make peace straight away (which means giving Russia what they want, obviously) he sounds like Neville Chamberlain in 1938. ""Peace in our time""--by giving aggressors everything they want bit by bit."
6504,"Poles do not appreciate being callled eastern europeans, just fyi."
6505,"There is no “Eastern Europe”, cf. Wolff

Also you mean country not nation"
6506,"You bring up Putin walking over Trump, yet more than two years later little has changed since Russia's invasion. We still Zelensky criticizing the EU for not delivering on promised aid, same with European countries and the US not allowing Ukraine to attack Russia.

We had Trump bringing up Russia invading Ukraine under Biden, seems like everyone hates to hear it and will just ignore it."
6507,"Aka impeachment #1.

Point stand that the gop in the senate didn’t do shit about it."
6508,Country
6509,Trump's not a fascist or Nazi now?
6510,Yes it will
6511,"Hopefully, they have a lot of pull"
6512,Lovely Konfederacja who would sell us to Russians to see Ukraine burn
6513,"Quick reminder that after the 1939 nazi-soviet invasion of Poland, Poland only regained its freedom and independance in 1989, and even then the last Russian troops only left in 1993. It's like only 40 years ago. It's really not that long ago. People who didn't grew up under communism grew up listening to their parents or their grands-parents talking about how it was, about X familly member getting murdered by the nazis and Y familly member getting murdered by the Russians.

The Grudge was in fact going away anyway, new generations anyway. 

But then Russian invaded Ukraine, and it brings back memories."
6514,"if you say ""\[nation or race\] are \[negative adjective\]"" then perhaps you are the bigot"
6515,Sweeping xenophobic generalisation . Well done you muppet
6516,"Never call yourself Polish again, you piece of trash"
6517,Cultural heirs to the slavedom are calling others racist. Comical.
6518,"Polish immigrants in the US absolutely don't represent Poland or Poles in any way, shape or form. Fuck, how many of them even actually speak polish? How much time did they actually spend in Poland? A week here or there for some holidays? Lmao. They're literally being made fun of in Poland. See r/ilovemypolishheritage for example.

Same thing for Irish americans who love the IRA but can't even tell you which one.

Same thing for German Turks supporting Erdogan.

Etc etc."
6519,How old are you. Ffs
6520,"You can leave nato if you want but you can't kick others out without the support of the rest of NATO members. 

And then again why would you want to kick poles out when they are working on having the largest standing military in Europe?"
6521,Because European stability and promoting democracy is a keystone of US economic and foreign policy. At least it used to be before Trump took over the Republicans Party. Traditional Regan Republicans were always against appeasement.
6522,"That Harris is a known politician in USA, isn't she?

Also, America is a continent or two continents depending on who you ask and unfortunately this subreddit isn't for politics in general or even politics in America, it's specifically for politics in the USA."
6523,"There are Polish Americans, and those Polish Americans care about Poland. Is that not obvious?"
6524,Clever. I think I like this Kamala lady.
6525,"It finally got through my Dad's thick skull at least, which I've been trying to do for I don't know how long. My Dad is a Polish-American Pennsylvanian and it finally ""clicked"" for him last night. I've worked for lawyers my whole life and the best ones have always had a way of speaking to everyone."
6526,Not just Polish Americans. Any American of European descent should be concerned for their home country. Even Slovenia (Melania Trump’s home country) transferred all their tanks to Ukraine.
6527,"Correct. However, he'd be swiftly kicked out. We've been prepping for this for decades."
6528,"Not a Trumper here but if we’re talking about his asinine NATO treatment we should bring up his insistence that member countries contribute more. Because looking back, he was in fact right about it."
6529,I wonder what Putin has that's allowing him control over Trump.  It's a bit strange.
6530,Bit sad that politicians have to come with a list of goodies tbh.
6531,"It’s not the memorization that impressed me, it was the strategic choice of which stat to memorize that impressed me. Sorry if I didn’t make that clear.

I don’t expect my President to know the population of every ethnicity in every state. That serves no purpose. However, she suspected the topic of supporting Ukraine would come up. Most of us could have guessed that much. Most of us probably could have guessed that she would say something to the effect of “defending Ukraine is defending sovereign democracy”. Some of us might have guessed that she’d say “if Ukraine falls, Poland is next.” A slim few of us may have guessed she’d tie that back to Polish Americans. NOBODY would have guessed she’d tie it back specifically to Polish Pennsylvanians with an exact number. You’re lying if you claim that. It was a chess move set up far, far in advance. THAT’S what impressed me, not the stat itself."
6532,"The bar may be ridiculously low, but there's still only one candidate passing over it"
6533,"It reminded me of the Romney-Obama debates in regards to levels of preparation, except only on Harris's part.

Sad thing is, Trump understood his assignment, and it was: *terrify the American people with the threat of pet-eating-transgender-brown-skinned-immigrants*. Anybody who came away thinking he did a good job received that message loud and clear."
6534,"Just for a datapoint, are your wife's relatives still attached to Poland enough to pay extra attention to Poland's relationship with Russia?"
6535,"I think you misunderstand my point. It isn’t the memorization of a simple stat, it’s the selection of that specific stat and how it was inserted into her argument. She very purposefully connected the Urkraine war to a specific ethnic population in a specific state that’s integral to electoral victory. 

She has many stats memorized, far more than her opponent. However, this particular stat is obscure and seemingly meaningless without a specific purpose for use. She planned to use it in advance of the debate knowing that the topic would likely come up. Her opponent clearly had no such plan."
6536,"And yet, her opponent is incapable of doing anything similar. Pretty scary so many people would vote for someone incapable of “basic thinking”."
6537,From the inside we are voting for continued democracy and freedom.
6538,Finally a Polish joke that isn't denigrating them.
6539,"My wife’s family came from RushPoll, the area was Russia , then Poland, then Russia, then Poland. 
They came to America for a reason."
6540,Not of Polish descent but married to one and this is exactly how I see Trump if he will win.
6541,tbh we are quite tall better comparison would be some mountain elves or sth
6542,">revanchism

Uhhh no, we're not Russian and we're not looking to start a fight to reclaim ""lost"" territories."
6543,"Nie no, Rosja nie istnieje tysiąc lat, a jak byli pod butem mongołów to raczej dużo się z nami nie tłukli"
6544,"Imagine being Polish and not knowing Poland's history.


Yes, the resentment is real, and Poland has reasons to fear and detest Russia, but being threatened by Russia for a millennium? Russia hasn't existed that long as a country. 

In fact, Poland was the regional power for about 300 years. Russia stood no chance at the time. They had been under the Mongol boot for centuries. 


You need to Polish up your Polish history."
6545,"Polish up your history knowledge, Tsardom of Russia was half a millennium ago, and we had Germanic people (Germany, Prussia, HRE, etc.) often as an enemy for a millennium.

  
Also, does it really matter who was against whom such a long time ago? If so, then you have to paint half of the world as your enemy regardless of what country you are from."
6546,"America's right wing is basically fascist. More like Konfederacja in PL, or AfD in Germany. 

PiS is traditional right-wing populism. Same as MAGA."

Law and Justice (Polish: Prawo i Sprawiedliwość \[ˈpravɔ i ˌspravjɛˈdlivɔɕt͡ɕ\] ⓘ, PiS) is a right-wing populist and national-conservative political party in Poland. Its chairman is Jarosław Kaczyński.

  
Jaroslaw is an avowed and proud conspiracy theorist. So yeah, insane right-wing is accurate, bro:

And as always:

\*\*\*\*\*

 \*\*\*"
6549,"Regardless if you keep going left or right eventually you reach the same point 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_theory"
6550,And haven't been red-pilled
6551,"This. My family was partially murdered by Germans and Soviets, after which the rest of the family was send to the East by Soviet occupiers. For me it's not only a national case. It's personal. As it is for way too many Poles."
6552,If Poland isn't in NATO it would be possible to gain back the old east German land the poles took from us. President Putin said something along the lines a few years ago. Together with Russia Germany could restore the old order
6553,Polish Americans don’t even know where Poland is on the map 😂
6554,She seems like she has more than just “concept of a plan”.
6555,"I mean, she had a team working with her on this for two weeks. Trump could have had good answers but he's a moron who picks people based on their semi-celebrity status."
6556,Better later than never!
6557,Poland is in NATO. We all need to be worried if Russia invades and Article 5 is invoked.
6558,"He was right, and he wasn't. He was right that some (most?) countries don't meet the requirement of spending 2% GDP on military. He was very wrong that it somehow is stealing like a parasite from the USA. The spending requirement is just that: it says how much countries should spend on their own defense, not how much should they pay to US or NATO. US doesn't ""lose"", it's not like there is NATO budget that needs to be filled by the 2% from countries, and whatever is missing is paid by the US. The direct loss there is the following: US has biggest military industry in the world, and lots of military investments in NATO countries are spent in the US. Hence, US gains in taxes, strengthens their economy and all that. 

Of course, indirectly you could say that countries spending less are doing this only because they are in NATO with the US, and they count on US being big enough deterrent that they don't need to spend as much. This is, however, a more nuanced position. Of course it's wrong that some countries agree on something and then don't keep up with the promise, when others do. But that's not the same as how Trump portrays it. 

And what would Trump do if Putin moves further and attacks rest of Europe? What if he attacks Norway and Finland? Will US react in Finland but leave Norway?"
6559,"I’m sure a lot. Trump has been in bed with the Russian mob ever since Giuliani took down the Italian mob (the Russian mob filled to void in nyc).

 I’m fairly certain he built his wealth laundering money for them/Russian oligarchs/Putin. Remember, the trumps don’t need banks they have Russia"
6560,Or maybe it’s our tax dollars working for us?
6561,PA is not 'every state' though. It's considered (right or wrong) to be THE state this time around (one reason the debate was there).
6562,Yep. Although her mother's peers are all dying off.
6563,"I didn’t misunderstand your point. That’s just how presidential debates work. You have attacking arguments, defending/rebuttal arguments, and you use stats and facts to back those up. You study very well your opponent and try to predict what they’ll use against you. Sure, it was a great argument that she used. But it’s nothing new or super impressive, it’s just how debates work"
6564,"As it turns out that whole Pollock joke thing from the 70-90s was literally disinformation, I can only assume from russia"
6565,"Finally a Polish joke that isn’t copy/paste from Hitler propaganda:

https://www.usmbooks.com/images/Pollacken/Polen1b.jpg"
6566,"During WWII Lviv was taken by the Soviets, then Nazis and then Soviets again. After all this, Hugo Steinhaus who lived there got asked in an office if he had ever crossed the Soviet border. ""The border crossed me! Twice!"" he answered."
6567,Which area exactly do you mean?
6568,"Not a single Polish person has heard the phrase ""RushPoll"" your wifes family are making shit up and people are taking the piss out of this comment on Polish groups."
6569,"Wtf is RushPoll?

Is this from r/shitamericanssay?"
6570,The word is Kresy in Polish.
6571,">RushPoll

Please ask your wife's family wtf does this mean because I live in Poland and I can't find any city or town that even resembles that word lmao"
6572,"It is it’s own thing, and MAGA is it’s slogan still; it is more than K

PiS is PiS, it’s nothing like MAGA, older or more 

There is no “traditional” rightAwignpopusoim, and again PiS isn’t unique h pretty much"
6573,See my exact point.
6574,"That’s not what the word “definition” means. Words have definitions.

You’re talking about a “description”, which I responded to- and which in the first place doesn’t actually even say what you said. 


It is not.


Very stale and very predictable, you’re not adding anything here"
6575,"Thanks for the land 😘, you ain’t getting it back 😂"
6576,"Nah we should dismantle Germany again instead, take back the old western Wendish land the Germans took from Polabians instead."
6577,"That's nonsense. Many of them are within a few generations. Hundreds of thousands of Americans were *born* in Poland. They could identify it so much easier than the average American, and they care. If you're trying to say American Polish people don't care about Poland, you're just fucking wrong."
6578,"It's a relief, for sure. It was exhausting, since politics is all he ever wants to talk about (75, widowed.) He's the only family I have left, so it's been an exhausting 9 years fighting with him about this. 😅 The disappearance of no taxes on SSI and the omission of that promise from last night also tipped him, I think; no taxes on SSI was his big issue (even though he doesn't depend on it in any way.)"
6579,"Going by how Poland was always abandoned by its supposed allies, I believe that Security Council of NATO will not even entertain that invocation. Why risk it all for a small country, somewhere on the edges of civilised world... like 1 September '39..."
6580,">the Russian mob

The KGB? Or is that something different? 

That is fascinating and a quite realistic supposition."
6581,"I guess I'm naive. I expect more gravitas from a leader. And talking about taxes, the government pays way more than it collects (>$5k/American)."
6582,"Maybe I've just become used to shitty debates in the Trump era, but I'm not the only person to be impressed by this specific part of the debate.

[Example 1](https://youtu.be/7OKP5ZWfTOQ?t=916)

[Example 2](https://youtu.be/X-II4WQEpaE?t=827)

These are Republican political operatives calling this out specifically. You might not think it was that impressive, but there are plenty of smart politicos who agree with me that it was."
6583,Started by the German immigrants in the time of Bismarck
6584,Probably. Being a millennial I can only tell you how many times I've heard terrible Polish jokes growing up
6585,"It’s from Bismarck era German propaganda and then regurgitated by Hitler, to justify his mass genocide of Polish people."
6586,"He said ""Russia then Poland then Russia then Poland"" assuming that he means this area is polish now it isn't Kresy because they aren't part of Poland anymore."
6587,"Assuming that it is proceeded by ""the"" then it's sounds a little like Terespol."
6588,At least you are honest about your hostility towards Germany. You want to wage war against us again
6589,Thats hardcore-kremlin-BS. NATO stays united in the face of  the ruzzian warmonger
6590,"Something different, like the actual mob. Pimping, drugs, extortion. Think godfather but Russian.

The kgb is/was the Soviet’s FBI. I’m sure there’s dirt there too but I was talking more of the illegal enterprise that is the mob"
6591,"Alright, I’ll give you this one, it was impressive"
6592,It was clearly just an expression. The area that changed hands that often was the Kresy
6593,"Well, your nation literally murdered my family for being Polish and educated, sorry-not-sorry for ""hostility"" from us."
6594,"For now. When it will come to sending warm bodies to combat, you will see, and again, we will left alone."
6595,"Thanks.  Is the American branch of the Russian mob closely tied to the Russian base?  

It makes sense with Trump's association with Epstein, they were likely in business with mafia as well."
6596,There's a connection since afaik a lot of the old KGB and other agencies actually became the mob after the soviet union fell.
6597,I do not believe this was a specific town or city but somewhere within the Pale of Settlement which included eastern Poland. An area where the border was fluid over time. The reference was more like Yiddish commentary.
6598,See and this I would rather have Russia than Poland as a neighbour east of us
6599,"I don’t know, but I would assume so. I’m sure there are some connections there.

I’m not super familiar with the workings of the Russian mob. I was watching some docs about the Italian mob take down and nyc in the 70s/80s on Netflix, that’s about all I know. Trump appeared in some of them (anyone dealing with real estate/construction in nyc had to go through one or both mobs)"
6600,"Yes lol I'm familiar (Polish Jew). 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kresy

The Kresy refers to the entire region that also encompasses the Pale of Settlement. If you look up the territory of the Pale of Settlement and the territory that was taken by the Russian Empire during the partitions of Poland, it is perfect overlay. It's because Poland had uniquely liberal religious and property protections for Jews prior to the partitions, resulting in the largest Jewish population in Europe. They settled particularly heavily in the cities of the Kresy (Eastern Poland/PLC at the time, today modern Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine) as there was more economic opportunity there and Jewish migrants were encouraged by the Polish nobility who owned vast swathes of the territory there. Russia had virtually no significant Jewish population prior to the partitions--when it gobbled up most of Poland it inherited the world's largest Jewish population and due to the obvious antisemitism, Catherine the Great decreed that they would not be allowed to migrate beyond the borders of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Hence the Pale of Settlement."
6601,"There is no region in Poland or its former territory called that, so a specific town/city or village is the only option here. If ""Rushpoll"" is often preceded by ""the"" when they speak, it could be Terespol as it would sound similar to ""the rushpoll"" otherwise it could be somethinglike ""różopole"" if there is any place with that name in the east. You could also ask if any family member remembers what Voivodship was that in to make it easier."
6602,"Believe me, we'd rather have French than you, you have a history of commiting genocide on us."
6603,Ernest Hemingway was right
6604,You can move to Ukraine and see for yourself how good it is to have them as a neighbour

6606,What great timing after this debate. Perfect moment to announce this
6607,Great night for Harris-Walz team!
6608,"Signed ""A childless catlady"" 😂"
6609,"Swifties are more passionate than conservatives, this definitely won them votes!"
6610,"And that's a wrap, Donald."
6611,Fucking slam dunk. Get fucked MAGATs
6612,"Man, Harris has endorsements from Dick fucking Cheney and Taylor Swift"
6613,Hell yeah! 
6614,So Harris has Taylor swift and (unofficially) Beyoncé. Trump has kid rock Hahaha
6615,The Swifties have made their choice.
6616,This endorsement will move more people than the debate.
6617,"Signed,

""A childless cat lady.""

*Chef's kiss*"
6618,"Framing her endorsement as earned and won by the debate is a masterstroke. Great way to help frame the debate as an unmistakable win. Great confidence boost to the Kamala Walz campaign. This is when she can strike. Now is when you do the podcasts and media appearances, she's more than capable of handling it. After being insulted and called dumb and incapable of speaking, she flat out dogwalked Trump like none of his opponents have.

This is her opening."
6619,Am I a Swiftie now?
6620,HUGE dig at Vance by singing off as “childless cat lady” 👏🏻👏🏻
6621,Thank you tay tay ✨️
6622,"Check out the coping on the conservative subreddit right now, it's hilarious. Harris just gave the best performance in the history of presidential debates."
6623,"I very much appreciate that she said ""Do your own research"".  She didn't tell anybody who to vote for, only who SHE is going to vote for.  Trump is going to flip his shit and I'm here for it."
6624,Hell yeah. Lets get more young people registered again.
6625,Confirmed. Taylor Swift is a black trans woman illegal immigrant who eats pets. /s
6626,At least the right have Kid Rock who makes music for people who know exactly how much Sudafed they can buy legally at CVS.
6627,Hey Donald. Looks like you're......fucked.
6628,I wonder how long ago her team decided she’d do this tonight.
6629,Thank you Taylor.  from all the childless cat people.  + from berks.
6630,"its so joever

(for trump)"
6631,Not a swiftie in any way but I feel a lot better knowing this. I may not care for it being necessary but I can also appreciate that it absolutely was
6632,"“Harris/Walz Landslide Victory!” is the only headline that matters right now. 

Make it happen America."
6633,"I feel like most people who listen to Taylor Swift have probably already made the decision to vote for Kamala Harris. But, hey, whatever helps."
6634,"The seed for this was planted when a few weeks ago Trump claimed Taylor was supporting him along with AI images of her in MAGA gear.  

That was the point Taylor Swift had to make her stance clear because one side was trying to claim she was in their camp."
6635,"Oh no, my crazy conspiracies about Taylor secretly being a Nazi the whole time"
6636,Caitlin Clark also liked the post!
6637,"That’s it, Ben Shapiro is no longer a fan of Taylor Swift.

/s"
6638,There we go!
6639,Just in time for the beginning of early voting in some states. We need to show up and keep Trump out of power.
6640,We all knew it would come eventually after the AI image debacle. Good timing on her part. Well thought out and plain spoken.
6641,"ladies...please help this country this Nov.

*a 60 yr old guy*"
6642,"Harris wins debate against talking point fool who repeats himself and Taylor agrees.  No room for FOX spin, this is the news cycle!  And to Trumpers who say who cares…uh your candidate who shared a fake endorsement"
6643,"There was zero doubt of this happening, but Trump invited it by stupidly putting out fake images of her supporting him"
6644,"One of the more significant celebrity endorsements ever considering how much she’s a part of youth culture. Transcends party lines. 

Girl dads and cat lady power"
6645,"Endorsements don't mean shit if you don't vote. 


CHECK YOUR REGISTRATION AND FREAKIN' VOTE. IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO REGISTER, LET'S HELP EACH OTHER OUT."
6646,Nice!!!  Hopefully this helps a few undecided people make the right choice
6647,Swifties! Assemble.
6648,Never doubted her for a second 🫶
6649,"DO NOT FORGET TO VOTE.

It is not over yet."
6650,"Would love to see her, Beyonce, and maybe Rihanna do a political add together.    Won’t happen but that would be dope"
6651,So the Left has the Swifties now too? Damn.
6652,"Not surprised to see Taylor making a statement! She's been pretty vocal lately about where she stands on politics. Love that she's using her platform to speak up for what she believes in, but you know this is gonna stir up some drama online."
6653,The tent keeps expanding.  Let’s go save our country!
6654,Cool. Make sure you still register and vote. Check your status. Don’t make same mistake as last time and assume it’s over
6655,Solid
6656,Swifties won't vote red. Everything has changed. You belong with Kamala. Kamala has style. She will fill your wildest dreams. Now we've got bad blood with Trump. He needs to calm down and shake it off. He was mean to her. Look what he made Taylor do. She knew he was trouble.  Trump's got a blank space in his head. It's the end game now!
6657,"“We are never, ever, getting back together” - The Presidency to Trump"
6658,Game. Blouses.
6659,What a terrible day to be Donald Trump
6660,"Real genius plan from the Trumpwads who used AI to falsely claim she would ever back him.

Buncha geniuses. 🤣"
6661,Oh its over now. Congrats president harris. LOL
6662,"Way to go KH! To the guy who couldn’t find his ass with both hands, she very ably handed it to him. She fights for the causes I believe in too, TS!"
6663,"I’m not sure what impact this has, but I hope it has a push for Harris"
6664,The Taylor Swift and Dick Cheney tag team to the rescue! Bonkers
6665,"Good girl, Tay!"
6666,The phrase: “no shit” comes to mind
6667,Yes Taylor! You go girl.
6668,Now have her put voter registration and early voting booths at every tour stop and it's over
6669,The Demi-Goddess of the American Economy has spoken.
6670,"I was praying to Obama that she would, sad though that we need a billionaire to save our democracy though."
6671,Oh yeah!
6672,Finally!
6673,Winning
6674,Boom!
6675,Swiftvoted
6676,I know bottles of ketchup and depends are gonna hate to see trump coming tonight
6677,"well that's one voter that was influenced by the debate. Take that nay-sayers

yeah yeah, she probably already was a Harris voter, but the debate sealed the deal!"
6678,"There it is, folks."
6679,….and Trump is toast
6680,Now all you have to do is get youth demographic to vote.
6681,Why did she wait for the debate? She still needed convincing??
6682,gg it's over.
6683,"My conservative, Swiftie cousin liked the post. I’m so hoping that means she’s switching."
6684,"Why do people keep using this shitty fucking partial quote. It makes her sound like she doesn't speak English. 

>I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.

Quote the whole fucking thing so she doesn't sound like she's as bad at English as these terrible fucking journalists."
6685,"Why write headlines that are so poorly truncated that they make the subject seem as mentally incompetent as the article writer? How does an editor not go ""your headline takes a normal sentence and makes it look like it was passed through Google Translate five times"" - why do people who write at this quality level receive money for it?"
6686,"Yeah, that should really help Harris's case here. Really hoping this drives more voters to her."
6687,Finally put her money where her mouth is. She needed to quiet all that noise about being Trump adjacent. Glad she finally said something
6688,"Damn I’m a Swiftie, always have been trust me bro"
6689,Glad she did it but this chick fucking milked the time in between. Taylor Swift 100% did this for attention. She could have shut down Trump when he used her likeness and she didn't. Scumbag woman.
6690,"I mean, a pop star endorsing a candidate should have no impact on the elections, but, alas, it is the US, after all... 🤣"
6691,"I like Harris, but I don’t give two fucks what this narcissistic pop star has to say on the matter"
6692,[deleted]
6693,"Elon just offered to give her a child, and protect her cats 😳"
6694,This endorsement would have meant something if it came before the debate.
6695,Who cares what this twat supports
6696,And this is the last we need to hear about this. Seemed like Clinton wanted to turn her campaign into a Fleetwood Mac comeback tour and look how that turned out.
6697,Billionaires for Harris!
6698,Is Taylor Swift for the occupation of Palestine?
6699,Who really cares what Taylor Swift thinks and what does she know about politics!
6700,She definitely wasn’t paid to do this.
6701,Abortion? Seriously why are people voting on this subject who gives a shit
6702,Good! She can split all her earnings amongst us! Just like a true communist!
6703,There was so much buzz about when it would happen and this was unreal.
6704,"I was of the opinion the debate should've had its moment, because bah gawd that was a lopsided victory for Kamala. But now I see the timing of Taylor's endorsement as this one-two punch effect where a mountain of news becomes an avalanche of news and I'm all for it."
6705,"Swifties (myself included) have been saying to the naysayers for weeks that taylor will time her endorsement. She did it last year in october to drive voter sign up, she’s doing it after harris crushed trump in the debate to give her even more momentum. 

She *despises* trump. Even if she doesn’t agree with everything harris does, she was always going to endorse her."
6706,I have been wondering when she would announce this. Timing is everything.
6707,"Check out the google trends for ""voter registration"" and note the times: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fm%2F03xm3_&date=now%201-d&geo=US&hl=en-US"
6708,"While I do believe she timed this in part due to the debate, wasn’t she catching flak this past weekend for being pictured hugging Brittney Mahomes. I just wouldn’t put it past her/ her manager/ PR to announce her endorsement to try to show a contrast between her and Brittney"
6709,The true 1-2 punch!
6710,[deleted]
6711,"The young vote can be huge. Biden won Georgia by something like 12,000 votes in 2020. The 18-25 population in Georgia is about 1.4 million. If just 1% of them mobilize and vote, that's more than the margin of victory in 2020."
6712,[deleted]
6713,Let’s get you off to ~~bed~~ jail
6714,The night couldn't have gone better. Kamala killed it.
6715,Nice
6716,"One more time for the people in the back:

Get fucked MAGAts!"
6717,And Bernie!
6718,"Dick Cheney, the shotgun blast to the face guy?"
6719,But… but… Trump has Kid Rock and RFK Jr.!! He’s got great endorsements too. /s
6720,"Don’t forget hulk hogan, the crazy dude from growing pains, and the washed up actor that played Hercules"
6721,"Trump unofficially has The Rocks vote though.

After endorsing Biden and Harris in 2020 and being unable to take the heat, Dude went on Fox News this past April saying it was a mistake to make an endorsement, then went on to talk about how the country isn’t in great shape right now.

He’s a coward."
6722,And more than the RFK endorsement
6723,"A lot of people didn't watch the debate live and probably intended to watch it ""at some point"" to decide their vote. People are lazy after all.

Taylor Swift basically gave her massive audience a Cliff Notes for the debate. ""I just watched it and Harris clearly is the better candidate"".

I guarantee there will be tens of thousands of people who decide to just skip watching the debate and take her word for it."
6724,"After reading her message, that's someone worth listening to."
6725,“Trump definitely beat Harris… even my gf who isn’t totally conservative thinks so too. Yeah.” The cope is unreal.
6726,"I''d still take Obama over Harris with debate perform, though she did do well"
6727,The description of her “cult like fanbase” sent me.  Zero self awareness
6728,She always looked suspiciously Venezuelan to me.
6729,"Taylor Swift is suspicious because she doesn't fulfill her duty as a woman to pop out children and raise them at home , while her husband is away doing physically demanding masculine things like buying donuts."
6730,You forgot the in prison part
6731,"No no no, the operation comes *after* he imprisons her."
6732,"One. You can buy one, but, you have to scan your license.

Also, I agree."
6733,buddy the only thing that is fucked is the British justice system...
6734,"They have Swiftie-themed Harris-Walz merch available and are using her music… so it’s been in the works for a while. I’d suggest this has been planned almost ever since Kamala got the nomination. She’s the ultimate celeb to get, and her endorsement would either crown Harris as the winner, or deflect if that was felt necessary from a less than optimal performance."
6735,Since she’s been getting a lot of flack for buddying around with mahomes maga wife all weekend
6736,"Cat less child person chiming in with a thank you to Taylor as well. Got nothing against cats, but I’m highly allergic."
6737,It'll probably incentivize unregistered Swifties to vote
6738,Taylor started with music that has a country vibe to it. Super popular in the small town I grew up in that was full of conservatives. She’s also just makes good music that’s easy to get into. So I’d imagine she has a lot of conservative fans in general.
6739,Lot of Swifties are conservative af. Her fanbase is most prominent in flyover states
6740,It'll energize her fans to get people registered
6741,Her fanbase calls Beyoncé a monkey so I doubt it.
6742,Kid Rock is going to put out a video tomorrow of him shooting all his Taylor Swift records for sure.
6743,Unite the clans.
6744,With so many billionaires working against our democracy though….
6745,Psst… the campaign likely planned it this way so both political and entertainment media would be wall to wall on the debate 
6746,At the very least she will motivate her democratic base to vote and increase turnout. I think she’s given a great boost to Kamala in addition to the outcome of the debate last night.
6747,She endorsed Biden in 2020 and is an outspoken supporter of abortion rights and the LGBTQ community. Any narrative that tried to connect her to Trump was not based on reality.
6748,… if you don’t think this was planned some time ago in order to come out on the night of the debate I’ve got a beachfront property in Kansas I’d love to sell you
6749,"People like you can't just be satisfied with anything, can you? 

Be fucking happy she spoke out at all. She had no reason to do so, and plenty of reason to keep quiet."
6750,Same reason they have Hulk Hogan tear his shirt off for Trump. Difference is Harris has relevant people endorse her.
6751,Apparently you ve never seen the jon cena effect in wrestling years ago. Those fans would do anything he asked them too. He’s like crack for the mentally unstable wrestling fans. Which is a major demographic of pro wrestling fans. Him or the rock ever runs it’s over for the opposition.
6752,She didn’t say who her fans should vote for. Read the statement. She said do your own research and register to vote.
6753,Please explain how it means nothing after the debate?
6754,SO MANY YOUNG VOTERS CARE. That’s who.
6755,"More than Hulk Hogan and Kid Rock, believe it or not."
6756,"According to the insta post, upwards of 9 million people so far."
6757,How much do you think a billionaire businesswoman would need to paid for something like this?
6758,"Because people think pregnant women should be able to access healthcare without their doctors turning them down because they are worried about being arrested? 
Out of interest, why do you think it’s a topic people shouldn’t give a shit about?"
6759,"Women, the people who die over abortion bans, overwhelmingly care.  So a lot of people give a shit."
6760,"Women will die in droves if abortion is outlawed, THAT'S why. 

And it doesn't just cover women who are pregnant by a month or two, it also covers neo-natal death, or rather a miscarriage. When the fetus is no longer viable and is effectively 'dead', it has to be removed from the woman. This is legally an abortion. 1/3rd of all pregnancies end in miscarriage, and have to have the fetus removed via abortion, otherwise it will fester inside them and kill the woman. 

Trump and his team went out of their way to overturn Roe vs. Wade, which then allowed states to determine whether they'd allow abortions or not, and now you have women who can't travel to other states (who'd have thought that stuff costs lots of money) dying because they go septic from a miscarriage and can't get the care they need. 

  
Women deserve to police their own bodies and make decisions for themselves that are right for them. Or would you rather that we tie every male's tubes at puberty? That way it removes the capability for them to impregnate women without making the direct choice to reverse it. That sounds like a stretch, right? Cool, now think about how women feel when the government tells them what they can do about their reproductive options, and literally in some cases die because of it."
6761,In the last week I saw a lot of comments on this sub saying how they don’t think she’ll endorse anyone.  I don’t know why people thought she was gonna do it before Labor Day when she did in October for Biden in 2020
6762,Unreal?
6763,The signing was great
6764,"To her MASSIVE credit, she stated her beliefs, and encouraged people to vote for theirs. She reminded people to register to vote, so they could vote for the candidate that supports their beliefs.

I'm a 40yo dude and her music isn't for me (not all of it, anyway haha), but I give her a ton of credit for how she purports herself as a human being."
6765,You don't know that she was always going to endorse her.
6766," Timing really is everything in politics. It’s strategic moves like this that can really sway those undecided voters. Plus, the energy from Swifties might just be what Harris needs to rally more young voters to the polls."
6767,Georgia is #1 for that trend.. Pennsylvania is #3.
6768,"Yeah this is more likely. Sorry but Taylor is always gonna look out for #1., herself-- which she should. But I don't think it's really some valiant reason other than protecting herself from the gross AI images and her friend being a big time Trump supporter."
6769,"they were, 20 years ago"
6770,Most Swifties are Millennials actually (so in their 30s and early 40s).
6771,Interesting age to totally guess.
6772,"The turnout for 18-29 year olds was something like a million voters - There are more there. 

And in other states there's even more to gain."
6773,"We’re acting like Swift is the nail in the coffin. Don’t forget Stacey Abrams did this with black women in Georgia and that’s why Biden won in 2020. Swift is an amazing endorsement, but the vote of black women was integral in 2020."
6774,I wish more stats like this would go viral. I have actually convinced a non voter to register but it took breaking down how someone can win the popular vote by millions but lose the election due to a small margin in a swing state. I also used an impactful infographic that shows non voters vs dem vs repub and the fact that close to half of the country doesn’t vote (so it’s not so much Dems vs Republican it’s Dems vs the couch.) Also the infographic about gerrymandering sealed the deal. Took hours but worth it. His initial logic for not voting was because he didn’t think his vote mattered.
6775,"15,000. Ask us how we know."
6776,"I'm a Georgian that's just about to turn 18. I've pre-registered to vote and can't wait to have my say in the election this year. I hope my generation steps up to the plate.

Kamala for the win!"
6777,"Nah, people dropping the big bucks on Eras tour seats can mostly vote 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.abc.net.au/article/103457252"
6778,"Umm.. Swifties are not primarily kids. Swifties are mostly young adults in their 20s. Swift has been in the spotlight for a very long time. Teardrops released in 2006 and her biggest blowup was the release of ""1989"" in 2014, which was 10 years ago. 10 years ago, swifties were teenagers, yes. Math."
6779,"I woke up 30 min ago, im in the eu. And yes, the vibe overall, she won. Fuck yea! Get him out, finally-"

6785,It was disappointing. But I doubt the Rock's fans were mostly Biden/Harris voters anyway.
6786,"> The Rock

The rock unofficially becomes a lot less menacing when you realize all that witchcraft energy has to go somewhere. He grew larger. His junk grew smaller."
6787,"What The Rock actually said:

""Am I happy with the state of America right now? Well, that answer's no. Do I believe we're going to get better? I believe in that. I'm an optimistic guy, and I believe we can get better.

""The endorsement that I made years ago with Biden was what I thought was the best decision for me at that time.

""Am I going to do that again this year? That answer's no. I'm not going to do that. Because what I realized that what that caused back then was something that tears me up in my guts back then and now, which is division. And that got me.

""The takeaway after that months and months and months, I started to realize like, ‘Oh man, that caused an incredible amount of, division in our country.’ So I realize now going into this election, I'm not going to do that. I wouldn't do that because my goal is to bring our country together. I believe in that, in my DNA. So in the spirit of that, there's going to be no endorsement.

""Not that I'm afraid of it at all, but it's just I realize that this level of influence —I'm gonna keep my politics to myself, and I think it's between me and the ballot box.""


The Rock complaining about people getting canceled is an option most comedians and famous people who push limits share. The Rock pushed the needle as much as anyone ever in WWE toward getting canceled, so it makes sense he'd be concerned. He also later came back and [did this](https://youtube.com/shorts/aeIThFox87s?feature=shared) and much more anyway so it didn't seem to change him much."
6788,Yup. That's why big sweeping policy wonk stuff is gonna have less impact than viral one liners.
6789,"I’ve never been a huge fan, but I spent the past week listening to her albums just because I wanted to see what the hype was about. And now this. I’m definitely a Swiftie now. She’s got my respect."
6790,"Listen to her Midnights album! It's a great, introspective album, and you can tell each song is carefully crafted. 

The Tortured Poets Department has a lot of great songs, but it suffers a fair bit from bloat. I highly recommend listening to ""The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived"" in light of her endorsement though. It's surprisingly apt."
6791,Lmao. You should make your own decisions.
6792,"Haha, an inceI from that subreddit really thinks people would believe he has a ""gf"" in the first place. 😂"
6793,The GF who totally isn't a conservative and who totally goes to another school out of state. Sure....
6794,It's too bad we won't get to see Obama go at it with Trump
6795,"After what I saw tonight, I wouldn't."
6796,Kennedy vs Nixon was better IMO.
6797,I mean her boyfriend does do something pretty physically demanding.
6798,"Nah, pretty sure Trump's fucked too."
6799,Yeah it’s more like that
6800,"According to Wikipedia, her fanbase is 55% Dem, 23% Republican, 23% independent. But if she can swing enough fans left in the right states, I could see her having an effect on this election."
6801,Your second point is extremely good. So thanks for that
6802,"I have heard the exact opposite, that her fan base leans very liberal.

It sounds like you're making assumptions based on her genre."
6803,"I'm sure that isn't her whole fan base, but that is repulsive."
6804,"How so? We have Elon fighting for freedom of speech. I mean, I know nowadays freedom of speech means you want to silence the political opponent. Not sure how that happened. And in the UK convicting people for words. Like the woman who was convicred for posting snoop dogg lyrics on her social media because it contained the n word.

6805,Need better turnout from young voters
6806,Except she blocked other female artists from the charts rereleasing her crappy album 60 times. She’s a chameleon for good PR
6807,Ooohh ill take it. I got $3.50
6808,boohoo she did the bare minimum expected of her. Nah she's skeevy.
6809,What makes someone relevant? How many albums they sell makes them worth listening to politically? I think whomever wins this election will hopefully be able to handle the inevitable world war that’s coming. It’s scary that political debates are like bad reality tv now days.
6810,"Because the die has been cast. Look at the front page of Drudge right now: ""it's over"". 

It doesn't count for much when you endorse someone after they've basically already won. It's elementary."
6811,Why don’t you read up on Harris and her policies and actual things she is for.  And not let any person like a Taylor or a kid or a hulk. Or anyone for that matter determine your vote.
6812,Blackmail.
6813,yeah i thought it would be later to not overshadow the debate but if it gets people to watch that donald train wreck that’s a plus
6814,I literally saw an article like an hour before the debate claiming she was disillusioned with the candidates lol
6815,Trump's got no one to blame but himself for posting those fake AI images of Trump Swifties.
6816,"I can’t remember the tweet exactly but she sent something along the lines of like “how dare you stoke the fires of hatred we will vote you out in November” back in 2020. 

I had people try and legitimately argue she had never taken a side and it wouldn’t make sense for her too because she had fans on both sides of the political spectrum and it would be too isolating. 

Like… I think we are well beyond that point lol."
6817,"Honestly, this was me this morning. I was salty about it. Happy to eat my words! Her statement was very thoughtful and had very clearly been in the works. 

Tonight was incredible and seeing her endorsement was like sprinkles on a sundae."
6818,"Something tells me she probably might have planned the announcement much later, but that whole AI stunt was a step too far for her and that was what made her come out earlier with the endorsement. Like Trump shot himself in the foot for that one for actually falling for some obviously shitty AI pictures."
6819,"Frankly, I'm surprised it wasn't later. Maybe she scheduled it for now expecting the debate to be closer? (Post-debate stuff shows undecideds who watched it breaking for Harris something like 22-to-2, iirc)."
6820,Didn't she also endorse someone in that Tennessee Senate Race a while back? I think it was the 2018 one. I wanna say that was also made in October.
6821,[deleted]
6822,I wonder how much of them are like football fans who are fans of the chiefs and of Kelce and don't wanna be a fan of Kelce anymore cause he's dating Swift. 
6823,I even saw a comment a few days ago that she's actually a Republican! I think there's still some confusion in right-wing spaces since she was an early 4chan-er before the place went super toxic.
6824,"A young woman, with a LARGE fanbase of women and girls, the majority of which are between the ages of 12-45, who like her were expressly targeted and attacked by the removal of the right to bodily autonomy by the SCOTUS?

There wasn't a fucking chance in hell she was rolling over and not saying anything, even if it was just on Harris' platform of restoring those rights she was giving her endorsement. But Dump forced her to go further and actually call out his shite while doing so, making it personal and eviscerating any argument for him post-debate."

6826,[deleted]
6827,"Black women are finally able to vote for one of their own. I don’t think more is needed to mobilize them now. And besides, last night the entire country watched a black woman wipe the floor with a white bigot. They’re eatin’ good right now."
6828,You are awesome.

6840,"There’s been a lot of disillusionment amongst wrestling fans around the Rock, at least in online circles. Of course, it’s as much wrestling politics as it is regular politics, but people don’t like him nearly as much nowadays"
6841,">  the Rock's fans 

Are we talking about fans of wrestling or fans of carefully crafted uncontroversial, conformist action movies? 

I actually enjoyed Red Notice for what it is. 

I know heist movies are considered uncool now, but I love them."
6842,"I don’t know how you can read that and disagree with me that he’s a coward.

“I just realize at this level of influence, I’m going to keep my politics to myself”

Taylor Swift has VASTLY more influence than he does, and she didn’t - and doesn’t - keep her politics to herself. The difference with him, is he has is stupid haircare line while being bald, as well as his shitty energy drink and other things that will affect his bottom line and wallet.

Which is to say, he’s still a petty coward."
6843,Sometimes saying nothing speaks volumes.
6844,"Let’s not pretend that Obama’s mastery of social media didn’t swing things for him, and Putin’s misinformation campaign also on social media, didn’t swing it for Trump. If the only people thst voted were those that understood the minutiae of policy, turnout would be in the thousands, not millions"
6845,"Honestly, the Netflix doc on her shows her as a really bright and caring person. There's a part where she struggles over making a political endorsement in 2020 as well."
6846,"Her talent and hard work are absolutely undeniable, and for someone at her level of fame to be so unproblematic speaks volumes. Also I'm not a Swiftie but I fucking love the song Delicate."
6847,"I said listen, not obey. Also, I'm Canadian. I can't vote in your election."
6848,That’s what her statement says
6849,It appears they just did.
6850,Why are you just repeating what Swift said?
6851,"Listening to someone because they have logical points is the very definition of making your own decisions my dude. we all listen to people everywhere, you have chosen to listen to people here on this sub. So choosing who to listen is very much an own decision"
6852,“MAGAs are sheep.” - Celeb worshippers
6853,"She lives in Canada, met her at Niagara Falls"
6854,"Lol Obama owned Trump so hard at dinner once, he inadvertently started the whole Orange Hitler era."
6855,"I mean trump was crap and wouldn't debate policy, and while yes Harris was debating well, she didn't get enough time because of trump and moderators to put her above Obama for me, especially since Obama did debates with people who actually used policy and not mean words"
6856,Sweaty upper lip the common trend between the two.
6857,The influence on Pennsylvania is probably going to be huge
6858,I don’t like that math.
6859,"I think the bigger focus is that she will get people to register and actually vote, who would not have taken the time to vote, or went through the process to register.  
There may be more folks slanting left in her fan base, but they may not have voted and now they will."

Edit.....  Also....  not talking about the UK."
6862,"I believe an endorsement from Swift will encourage that, do you?"
6863,"What does that have to do with her endorsement of Harris, and Biden in the past?"
6864,$3.50 and one penny
6865,The bare minimum would have been not speaking out at all.
6866,"You aren’t forced to listen to ANYONE’S political stance. She doesn’t care if you want her to say it out loud or not. 

You’re in here stating opinions. She’s stating opinions. It’s all good!"
6867,You’re asking knowing the facts. Do you think the people who are influenced by people like this actually process thoughts in the same way you or any normal person does? You know this isn’t the case. That’s the real election fraud. That everyone has a vote even if they have no clue wtf  is going on in the country.
6868,Nobody won anything yet. It is still a tight race. Any momentum still helps. People thought it was over in 2016 too and it wasn't

6872,"Or, occam’s razor and all that… she wanted to"
6873,"I was hoping for September rather than October. It's undeniable that she had a drastic affect on young women registering to vote earlier this year. Republicans panicked about it for quite some time, which was very telling. This gives her fans who perhaps didn't in the first round a chance to register with plenty of time before some key deadlines. In Texas, for instance, October 7th is the cutoff.

It also gives some legitimacy to the fact that Trump did *not* perform well to those who perhaps trust Swift more than they do the talking heads in mainstream media. It will prevent partisan hacks from convincing them that Trump performed better than a dumpster fire on stage tonight. If Taylor listened to the debate and agreed with Harris, then she must have won, after all.

I'm not gonna denigrate anyone who may think this way, like it or not, there are people out there who put *a lot* of stock in their idol's opinions. If this is what it takes to get more young people (women in particular) to vote, then I'm all for it. I mean, you are more likely to become a lifelong voter after voting at least one time."

She’s the best debate performance, ever."
6896,"I always forget that she’s from there but every time I’m reminded, I’m also reminded how my dad swore up and down that he saw her at the Cheesecake Factory in the King of Prussia Mall (this is when we lived in New Jersey). He finally pointed her out and the woman looked nothing like her, but we all had a good laugh."
6897,"I clicked on one, it said he temporarily banned them for doxxing. I mean before Elon everyone and articles were banned for vague reasons. "
6898,She only speaks out if she gets dragged enough like she did for hanging with maga mahomes and not endorsing Harris. She’s still silent on Palestine haha
6899,"Really cmon, there is only one reason why celebrities get this big. The system designed to influence elections via these fake idolised figures.  

Taylor swift is just the biggest one for getting the women’s vote secured without even any need to look at policies or track record. Everyone voting because of her is blinded by their bias towards anything she does. If she endorses someone else that crowd goes there regardless of who they are.

And it’s a big crowd too, millions. The motive is clear for the democrats here. They just got millions of voters without having to do anything but black mail some celeb with money and fame."
6900,"This is 100% where I’m at. 

I’ve tried to be really objective and think of an entertainment celebrity that could potentially influence my political opinion and I honestly can’t think of one. Like they’re just two entirely different worlds for me. 

But that doesn’t mean that this isn’t massive news and will likely be a pretty significant boon to the Harris campaign. I don’t personally understand, but the reality of it is undeniable."
6901,"Giving her the benefit of the doubt, perhaps she thinks that if she endorses too early, people might forget about her endorsement closer to the election?"

speaks volumes about your values and lack of understanding when it comes to the first amendment speech protections."
6918,"Not gonna lie, your version of events is a lot more interesting than reality. Now I want to know what they blackmailed her with?"
6919,"Exactly. We also should be mindful that those of us on this subreddit are going to be *far* more politically engaged than even the average person. Not everyone has the stomach or energy to keep up with the exhausting nonsense we've put up with for a decade at this point, nevermimd when politics was boring.

And that can be frustrating, especially when the stakes are so high for a lot of demographics and even moreso when low information voters are *part* of these vulnerable groups themselves.

That said, I think there is a big problem of talking down to these people. We want them to be *excited* to vote. These are not entirely unreasonable people asking for the moon here. Some are politically uneducated, some are or *feel* disenfranchised, whatever the reason, we need to meet these folks halfway and *welcome* them into the tent rather than teasing or criticizing whatever the reason they came around for."
6920,"Sure you do. You just like to think of yourself as above it. A celebrity has a bully pulpit, same as the president. Both can highlight issues and drive the national discourse, and all the sudden folks are judging candidates based on their stance in regards to these issues. As precipitated by people who have a long reach and large influence. Like Eleanor Roosevelt as first lady driving conservation of land into the public eye.

I guess I'm trying to say that there's a spectrum of influence beyond just endorsing someone, and therefore catching more votes. Taylor Swift can penetrate through to people who weren't enthusiastic enough to get the polls, and those people can then do their own research."
6921,A lot of times as you start digging into who people really are it becomes tougher and tougher to separate the art that they perform versus the people they are. For instance think of JK rowling. In many ways the Harry Potter books have taken a life of their own but the person who created them is a not necessarily someone you would agree with.
6922," >I’ve tried to be really objective and think of an entertainment celebrity that could potentially influence my political opinion and I honestly can’t think of one.

Yeah, it's weird how so many people seem to think the majority of Swifties are kids. I was 16 when the Taylor/Kanye VMA incident happened. I'm now 32. She's been at this for a WHILE."
6925,Don’t forget Lil Pump 🙄🤦🏼‍♀️
6926,The Rock is boring. All my homies fuck with Bautista.
6927,No not really. I’m tired of hear what celebrities think.
6928,People who don’t consider Taylor Swift’s opinions when making decisions are MAGA now?
6929,"My mom says I’m acute, but she never says what."
6930,"Unfortunately you genuinely believe politicians are good, just and fair people who really want to serve the people of their country 😂

Dismissing any possibility that your government are evil is so naive."
6931,"100% agree again haha. 

One of the most frustrating things I see is when a republican will do something objectively good and right, and the overwhelming response is “wow they did one thing right one time doesn’t change anything” and I just don’t follow that logic at all. 

If we can’t acknowledge them doing good things even after a history of doing bad things, what motivation does that give to anyone who is considering that maybe the gop is kinda fucked up? 

They’re just supposed to renounce their life long political affiliation but then also be rejected by the other side because it took them too long to find out? 

Like they’re essentially saying “you’re a horrible person and I will always think you’re a horrible person but you should agree with me anyway because objectively it’s the right thing to do” 

Even if they’re correct, eternal isolation from their old party as well as the one they’re considering supporting is just not a winning scenario. We have to be open to these people."
6932,I love him!! Remember the manatee incident from 2020?
6933,What about what gameshow hosts think? Specifically gameshow hosts that are failed steak salesmen.
6934,"We're completely in sync here lmao. To add on even more, I don't believe we think about how constantly and unforgivingly denigrating former Trump supporters or moderate Republicans looks to young voters raised in conservative families. The sort who are curious about forming their own views after they begin to buck the beliefs they were raised with.

Personally, it took me two *long* years to deprogram myself from Republican talking points and beliefs for the most part. I was about 22, and that was almost ten years ago now. Politics on social media has become *far* more polarized since then. I'm not sure if I would have been able to stick through re-examining every single one of my beliefs and drastically changing many of them if I had been constantly shit on for it by the communities I was desperately trying to join. I mean, breaking from conservative beliefs is *hard.*

And I don't think many who are privileged enough to be raised blue states or cities truly realize just how tough and isolating it is to do so. You lose friends, family, and even a sense of who you *thought* you were while you determine what beliefs you *actually* want to support rather than toeing the line conservatives enforce through things like social ostracizing, religious harassment, and even violence.

I think Harris actually understands this which is why she's courting ostracized Republicans right now. We need to give these folks an exit ramp. A reasonable choice to help them come back to a kinder, more peaceful reality. Don't get me wrong, I do my fair share of shitting on active MAGA shitheels who are *currently* bullying and harassing other people around them.

They're not who we're talking about.

It's the raised conservatives, the moderate Never-Trumpers, the embarrassed former-Trumpers, all of *these* people who could and *are* being attracted by Harris's sane platform and are tired of the insanity just like we are. Turning these folk away or shitting on them will only leave them vulnerable to re-radicalization or complete disenfrachisement.

We want to return to boring politics, right? This is *the* way to do it."
6935,"Because theres a difference between them accidentally doing something good for the wrong reason and them admitting that they were wrong before. Because thats what people want, if you won't admit that you were wrong before then I won't think that you actually learned anything or changed. I'm going to consider you a liar until you start telling the truth."
6936,Except that person was president and a businessman. And the economy did great. So there’s that. Nice try.
6937,"lmao, try to have at least a little consistency."
6938,"

6939,Trump should drop out
6940,"Everybody said that she was lightweight, but I've liked her since the first time she threw her hat into the ring. She's warm, effusive, intelligent, but most of all, she's a badass. You don't get to be district attorney in San Francisco because you're a lightweight. And then you don't get to be the Attorney General of the State of California because you're a lightweight. And then you don't get to be US Senator from California because you're a lightweight. And then you don't get to be the vice president for three and a half years because you're a lightweight. She put all those skills together and the way she talked about him was as though she was in a courtroom as her famous line goes Kamala Harris for the People your honor, and proceeded to treat him just like the thug and convicted felon narcissistic psychopathic grifter that he is. So, of course, you saw him melt down, fumble, sweat, and use all his bullying tricks, but none of them worked. And by the end of the debate, you saw a defeated 3-year-old who had just soiled his pants and was about to sulk off and lick his wounds."
6941,Love to see it
6942,"He got schlonged. She absolutely schlonged him. Never seen such a schlonging. Numbers like we’ve never seen. Big, strong men came to him, with tears running down their faces and said “Sir, how can this happen, you got schlonged, so badly schlonged. She just did it to you. You must do something immediately, if not sooner, to shed the stench of the schlonging. I mean, she schlonged you by a lot.”"
6943,"Let’s be realistic folks. Trump got his ass handed to him tonight because he let Kamala get to him. All he had to do was stay calm, and he couldn’t do it. 

Kamala was cool, calm and collected and made Trump look like a rabid dog. "
6944,You might say she “ate him for lunch.”
6945,You bet your sweet bippy!
6946,Too old too weird too facist too stupid too…..
6947,"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.salon.com/2024/09/11/she-whupped-him-kamala-harris-won-the-debate-by-turning-a-potential-disaster-into-a-laugh-in/) reduced by 93%. (I'm a bot)

> Regarding the debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president and current felon Donald Trump, the advice deluge happened beforehand.

> Trump clung to his insistence that he won the election and was swiftly disarmed by Harris saying, &quot;Donald Trump was fired by 81 million people ... And clearly, he is having a very difficult time processing that.""

> Maddow pointed to the split screen contrast between a light-on-her-feet Harris and a squinting, hunching Trump: &quot;I never saw the whites of his eyes the entire debate - shouting, constantly interrupting himself, not just going down tangents, but being unable to finish a thought, seeming very frustrated, very angry, very negative and very tired,&quot; she said.

6948,"This is his only shot at staying out of prison. If he loses, new AG and he is beyond fucked."
6949,"But he’s too narcissistic to, and Republicans are too cowardly to force the issue

Which is of course how he’d act if he won; refuse to leave office and Republicans would go along with it, democracy be damned

Join us at /r/voteDEM and check out the community info tab for volunteer opportunities to get out the vote, up and down the ballot! Won’t Trump is a danger to democracy, his unique grotesqueness gives a prime opportunity to score a blue trifecta!"
6950,One thing I think people don't understand about Trial Attorneys is that they need to be able to simplify complex ideas so a jury of ordinary people can understand it and they need to do it in a way that doesn't make people feel stupid. Kamala Harris has made a career of doing this so she knows how to make the general public understand what is going on. Her VP pick has the same skills because he made a career out of teaching children. They both have experience dealing with crazy people be it criminals or parents who think their child will be the next NFL star.
6951,"It just occurred to me: Kamala started off just a touch shaky with some answers before really hitting her stride. By the end, it was clear she was completely in control of her answers, tone, body language, not to mention trump’s brain. 

Was she just acting shaky to humanize herself before going in for the kill? I guess we’ll never know, but she was a shark by like 15 min in."
6952,"I would argue he's the exact same as every other debate, unhinged and rambling. No one has ever lost a substance debate to him. So it's not because of her, but she was able to get under his skin more than others for sure."
6953,"He looked old and out of touch with everything except wild online conspiracy theories and memes.  ""But I saw it on TV.""  Ok grandpa, it's time for your nap."
6954,Don’t insult dogs please.
6955,"If Dems don't take the senate, then filling a cabinet might be more difficult than you think.  A new AG is going to be grilled by Republicans during confirmation, asking things like if they would promise not to prosecute political rivals because it would set a bad precedent.  Senate Reps would come off as crazy, but that hasn't stopped them so far."
6956,It’s time for him to be put out to pasture.
6957,Every day Trump is on the ballot he risks down ballot votes. So actually I’m changing my position. Trump should really stay in this till the end and single-handedly lose everything for conservatives
6958,"and they can lie, just like our beyond reproach supreme court justices"
6959,Except all the damage done to the Supreme Court…

6968,*Trump campaign feverishly begins brainstorming on excuses to avoid another debate*
6969,"He needs it more than her.  She should offer a debate on MSNBC hosted by Rachel Maddow and Laurence O'Donnell.

If he is too afraid to agree, so be it."
6970,"And Trump doesn't want to debate again. Not even on Fox. He might think about Fox if one of the three hosts who he literally praised on the debate would host it: Shawn Hannity, Laura Ingraham and/or Jesse Watters. All of them strong MAGA soldiers. Go figure."
6971,Location will be the Sphere of Terra
6972,This would be like getting into the ring with Mike Tyson in his prime twice. Trump is to scared to take a beating like that again.
6973,"Stop, he's already dead."
6974,"I think a town hall would be much more effective. Debates always lack deep discussions on policy and are best suited for hot heads like Trump who plan to rail against their opponent(s).

We’ve seen that Harris can hold her own in a debate, now let’s give the public an opportunity to press her on her policy proposals."
6975,But Trump says he’s “less inclined” to debate Harris again
6976,"This would be great. It would giver her a chance to explain more policies and positions, and it would give us another opportunity to watch her bait Trump into trap after trap again, while his makeup melts as fast as his hope for the White House."
6977,"Wasn't there one Trump opposed later in September on nbc? Accept that debate and force Trump to back out a debate he proposed. 

Use the time as a town hall, which I think she needs as this is her opening and can dispel any don't know her policy narrative"
6978,Trump really looked like he didn’t want to be there. I’d be surprised if there’s a second debate.
6979,"If it’s on the 16th, it would be an awesome birthday present. "
6980,If there is a next time they should do it online. Sticking to network schedules makes things too rushed.
6981,I read spooksperson 😅
6982,Trump will only redebate Harris on Newsmax or Rossiya 1
6983,"If Trump shows up for [this October debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-2_w3ssMts) while Harris refuses, he wins the election."
6984,"Trump appointee and FBI Director Christopher Wray has a different October ""Event"" planned, with Fascism's Inside Man Garland standing behind him looking grave."
6985,I need a better one than last night.
6986,"October debate, November debate, let’s even have one in December too."
6987,No more debates - there is nothing substantial to say or debate - just same lies from one side and little resistance from moderators and Harris taking high road approach instead of direct confrontation . Will be the same BS with no substance .
6988,"Trump already said he won't do it, and declared himself the winner of the debate."
6989,“We have a concept of an excuse”
6990,"He's already citing some far right poll saying he won, so there's no point in another debate"
6991,Jon Stewart and RuPaul
6992,"Split the difference: let each of them choose one moderator. Maybe air it on a broadcast network, chosen at random. (Moderators don't have to be associated with the hosting network.)"
6993,trump might die in that debate ngl
6994,Kamala should agree to it as long as Jesse Watter's mom sits behind him and smacks upside his head every time he says something stupid.
6995,"Nah he doesn't have a choice. His performance was so terrible, that he can't have that debate being the most recent one on election day. His advisors will push him to do it."
6996,I've seen this mentioned a few times.  Where did he say this?
6997,"But he’s boasting about his performance and declining another rematch  saying “because we had a great night.”

“They lost very badly, the first thing they did is ask for a debate,” Trump said. “They always ask for a rematch.”"
6998,Por que no los dos?
6999,His orange makeup was melting so bigly last night
7000,"Last night, she baited him and he took the bait every time ...  hook, line and sinker.

She played him like a fiddle. 

Last night, He lost the election."
7001,*cites Elon Musk Twitter polls as evidence
7002,He said he would if Laura Ingram or Jesse Waters were the hosts “because they said I won this one”
7003,I can live with that...hosted on Comedy Central?
7004,Harris picks Travis Kelce.
7005,That'sASacrificeIAmWillingToMake.jpg
7006,Her hand would get pretty sore
7007,"If this quote is true (and i don't doubt it is), then it seems like she is playing him again.

He thinks he did great. Genuinely believes this. They propose another debate after seeing this. He sees it and then thinks he is in a position of power and will agree because he is an egomaniac with dementia. It affirms his positions and validates his feelings. 

They debate again and he is humiliated again."
7008,"She could do the same again, if they both show for the debate I linked.       
          
Harris won't possibly consider that debate without Trump. Trump's campaign considered doing the previous one in that series very seriously.           
            
Again, if he shows there and she doesn't, the election is his. Spins itself."
7009,The Trump fan club poll on Facebook gave him 100%. No need to look further.
7010,"Not only Twitter polls, but he screen grabbed them minutes after they went up."
7011,"Worse, he's leaning on a newsmax poll"
7012,Make it a roast instead and I’m in.
7013,And Trump picks Hulk Hogan?
7014,"Nah, just bring her slippers."
7015,"He doesn't want it. She spanked him badly.

She's a prosecuting attorney. Debating is her profession. 

He has to make it look like she's the one who refused. 

I seriously doubt you'll see another one."
7016,"Half Roast, half debate, and contestants and moderators have to come in drag."
7017,Deal.
7018,"

7020,This is one of the few times when a celebrity endorsement is actually a big effing deal.
7021,Can I just say how fucking awesome it is that she clarified in her statement that she needed to explain her *actual* position clearly largely because Trump posted a fake AI endorsement on his site.
7022,Now i assume most of her supporters who planned on voting were already supporting Harris. Now where Swift can have the biggest impact is encouraging her fanbase that is not really political to register and vote.
7023,"ladies...please help this country come Nov.

*a 60 yr old guy*"
7024,Finally!
7025,[deleted]
7026,Here we go! Love that she did it with a cat lady pic
7027,Earlier than expected.
7028,MSNBC stopped interviewing Tim Walz to read it.  WOW!
7029,"Get out and vote! 

Do not assume this is in the bag. Check your registration. Talk to your peers. Vote!!!!"
7030,As if Trump's night couldn't get any worse
7031,Look what you made me do
7032,Tell everyone you know. Make MAGA even more miserable 
7033,"Fuck, it's October already..?"
7034,About time
7035,Pretty funny that she did it right after the debate too. Everyone is ready to put that steaming pile of dump out to pasture!
7036,"""Who cares about what a celebrity has to say about the elections?""

- people who voted for a reality tv show celebrity with no prior political experience."
7037,"I'll say this. I don't like her mainly because of the distractions with the NFL/Chiefs (I'm a ravens fan) .

That being said, this decision makes me realize at the very least, she has eyes, ears, and understands the importance of the nutcase that is Donald Trump and J.D. Vance. The fact she took a jab specifically at Vance.

Alright, I can like you Taylor, at least on every day but Sunday."
7038,It’s joever
7039,Oh shit
7040,Shake the orange man off the presidency.
7041,"Hoping this is real…

7043,What’s this? Darth Cheney has tagged teammate Childless Cat Lady and she comes in hot off the top rope with a forearm shiver to the dome of Convicted Felon and Civilly Liable Rapist Donald Trump!
7044,"totally regardless of what people think of Swift, Trump or Harris; this is probably the most influential celeb. endorsement in history, just by the reach alone it's huge, but add to that the loyalty and community aspect of her fanbase and you are at a whole other level of impact."
7045,Taylor Swift is genuine and truly cares. Her timing is brilliant. So my hope is this will influence the younger generation because their future is on the line.
7046,I want to remind everyone ‘The Rock’ refuses to endorse anyone. Big tough guy afraid to endorse Kamala because his gym bros will get mad at him. Yet here we have Taylor taking a stand no matter the consequences. The Rock is a coward his movies should be boycotted for being a complete fraud.
7047,"My 13 year old niece and 17 year old nephew are stoked. People don’t realize how much Kamala is engaging the next generation of voters. This is the first time they have watched clips of a Presidential debate. They care and their Swiftie friends care.

It’s very exciting that they know the stakes of this election and politics aren’t boring to them."
7048,Dang wonder what that means for her friendship with Brittany Mahomes
7049,Final nail in the coffin for Trump.
7050,"I mean I’d be utterly shocked if she was pro Trump. She probably held off on the announcement out of fear of alienating a good chunk of her audience. 

Thats the struggle of being an entertainer. People were legit boycotting Eminem back in 2017 when he voiced his contempt for Trump."
7051,Oh Taylor the queen you are
7052,"Is that childless cat shit on the wall? Actually, it a appears to be ketchup. Still doesn’t make sense as I do not have a cat, and I ate pizza tonight… maybe the shady neighbors cat came over with some ketchup packets, he’s always up to no good, stole a 12 pack out of the garage fridge last week, stole my radar detector a month ago."
7053,She has earned many respect points from me.
7054,Her power 🤌🏻
7055,And that - hopefully - is the ball game.
7056,she’s all about those cats 😽
7057,So? I don't get the implication apart from a larger voter base?
7058,About time sis!
7059,I feel like Taylor endorsing Kamala is the least surprising bit of news I'll read today.
7060,I’m sad that this likely moves the needle for white women demographics. Still not that sad because they’d be voting blue
7061,This is huge. It’s crazy to think how many points this shifts the proverbial needle.
7062,"Obviously,, but better late than never"
7063,"White it’s nice she endorsed Harris, why should anyone care what she thinks about politics?  It’s not as if she’s ever used her privilege to advocate for any social causes."

7065,[deleted]
7066,"This matters how?
She is just another celebrity"
7067,But won’t call for a ceasefire. So brave of her… so demure
7068,"Jesus Christ. Let us enjoy the new debate memes Taylor!

This could have waited a day. Or until morning."
7069,No one will change their votes because of her
7070,Millions of young Americans are about to see clip after clip from tonight’s debate tomorrow on TikTok. This puts a positive tint of Kamala for many of them who respect Taylor Swift and will help generate hype around the performance there.
7071,Maximum impact
7072,[deleted]
7073,"Yeah, if anyone says “Ja Rule” this time, they don’t understand what this means."
7074,"Ya she’s the biggest celebrity in the world since Michael Jackson, millions of young women will care a lot."
7075," It's kind of interesting how influencer culture shapes politics these days. Like, her endorsement could definitely sway those who might just vote based on vibes rather than hardcore policy. It's just a reality we have to deal with, whether we like it or not."
7076,"Why? Why should anyone care which celebrity endorses which candidate? Shouldn’t people vote based on policies, personality, leadership, etc of the candidate?"
7077,[deleted]
7078,“I need to be very transparent with my plans for this election” is the new “I would like to be excluded from this narrative.”
7079,"Weeks late, coincidentally after she been getting shot on for 48 hours for her weekend with pats maga wife"
7080,"Taylor needs a TikTok challenge of her waiting in line and voting, and encourage fans to post their own TikToks. The result would be HUGE."
7081,"Agreed, but I think the bigger piece is mobilizing them, and then if she pushes any non-voters to voting for Harris then that's a big win."
7082,"This!!! Trump is already depressed, I’m sure he’s even more depressed rn 😭😭"
7083,More than that it’s from her Time magazine Person of the Year photo shoot 2023. A dig and clout.
7084,"Think about it:

Majority of the world is mocking your debate and your responses and lack of any substance. Then BAM!, one of the worlds most popular women endorses your opponent while you’re reading all the backlash from your bs.

The debate was a slap to the face, the endorsement was a heel to the balls."
7085,"Timing is perfect. Registration and getting an absentee ballot can take time (some states are starting to send them next week, I believe) so the right time is NOW. Taylor just jumped on top of Kamala’s shoulders, surfing a blue wave 🌊"
7086,Early voting starts in a few days in PA
7087,"I don't think so. 55 days to go. This is the home stretch, and I'm guessing Swift will do some campaigning towards the end. It's good to have her fans excited in advance."
7088,Think they did it because they wanted to see his reaction / surprise him with the good news. It wasn’t done out of disrespect for Walz at all
7089,His smile was delightful.
7090,I enjoyed where she said the trump ai thing of her clinched her decision to clarify how she was voting lol.
7091,If a man talks shit then I owe him nothing
7092,"""When they go low....we kick 'em in the teeth"""
7093,They show her for like 30 seconds per game I think we’ll survive
7094,"Hey man I agree. Steelers fan here. And I’d just like to say sincerely, fuck you. But also, let’s go vote and do this thing in November"
7095,"You don’t like her because she goes to a football game to root for her boyfriend and the cameras keep cutting to her? Sounds like you shouldn’t like the producers, not her."
7096,Ravens fan too lmao but holy shit did I gain a ton of respect for her
7097,"Her parents are Ivy League Wall Street sharks. They named her “Taylor” so her name would be gender neutral on resumes so she wouldn’t be discriminated against.

They’ve planned everything from day one. Her family is crazy smart and has connections. Taylor is no slouch herself, always staying relevant and has a ravenous following of loyal fans; she runs a tight business empire.

This entire move was perfectly planned and timed. She’s ruthless lol."
7098,"i love her, and i hate the chiefs, andy reid, clark hunt, and the mahomes and their douchey kicker. i don’t mind seeing her during a game once or twice a season, but like, we’re here to watch football. get over it networks."
7099,Ravens are trash
7100,It’s very real. Look at her instagram
7101,"It is, go to her IG."
7102,It’s on her Instagram.
7103,[deleted]
7104,Nothing?
7105,Eminem literally said fuck anyone who supports Trump and that they're not a real fan of his. Dude made his position clear.
7106,"Eminem is an angry white boy, just not one of those angry white boys…

And if she didn’t endorse Harris now to slap trump in the face after his abysmal performance, the impact wouldn’t have been the same in a few weeks."
7107,I think she is kinda fearless in the regard these days. If she had held  back I think it would have been because of the terror threats to her fans in the past couple of months. Putting another potential target on herself and people she cares about would have taken some serious consideration. I’m glad she spoke up though.
7108,">  climate change and my jet could be a problem though.""

she carbon offsets all her tours."
7109,Democrats can have conservative friends—and this just uplifts Harris and wrecks Trump more.
7110,"If it doesn’t matter why would
Trump use AI to pretend she liked him ."
7111,"I am by no means a Taytay fan, but trying to call her ""just another celebrity"" is wild. I absolutely hate the Michael Jackson comparisons, but she is likely the closest  we will ever see again with that level of fame(and it's still a distant second place)."
7112,"no, she's actually the biggest of them at the moment. That counts weather we like her or not."
7113,"Maybe, but it engages a lot of young people who ignore or are ignorant of the election, and it's importance, hopefully getting them out to vote when they wouldn't have before."
7114,"If that would be true, nobody would give endorsments. If nobody would change their vote because od her, Trump wouldn't be posting fake AI generated images"
7115,"Especially Gen Z, which is going to be one of the hard-hitting groups of voters

  
Not to say Swift doesn't have fans of all ages btw let alone limited as such"
7116,"I think it will just drive home the idea that Harris won the debate. The fact that Taylor watched this debate and said ""I want to vote for that woman."" is a great narrative. 

I honestly think an endorsement tonight is much stronger than an endorsement on some random Wednesday a month from now."
7117,No this builds excitement. It piles on doesn’t distract
7118,"I find you both make good points, but this gives sort of a feeling like swift is saying ""kamala killed it at the debate"" so, it doesn't work against the high, it uplifts it more. 

However, you do make a good point that timed a bit later, maybe after the next fucking moron thing Trump does, it could perhaps have greater effect. 

Idk good points for each side, and I can't really have an opinion either way. 

The important thing is, she did it."
7119,i think the hashtags debate and swift are going to explode bringing attention to the debate which is good
7120,Rides the amplitude of the debate.  It’s literally the best possible time for Tswift.
7121,"Millions of swifties are going to watch tons of videos about this debate now that the
woman they worship has endorsed Harris.

Guess what else they are going do. Talk to everyone they know about voting for Harris and probably talk to their other non swiftie friends. Harris will get plenty of props for crushing Trump in the debate. Swift endorsement is a bonus."
7122,"Seriously, where is that man. Been trying to find him for years now"
7123,"You're asking the wrong question. Should they make up their mind regardless of celebrity or other opinions? Yeah, probably, in a perfect world. But people do care about such things so it does matter."
7124,And this is relevant to my statement in what way?  We live in a society where celebrities and influencers have real impacts on their audiences.  The morality of it is a separate discussion.
7125,"""Is"" and ""ought"" are very different things. It can be true that celebrity endorsements might influence voting patterns whilst also being true that they shouldn't."
7126,"""Why? Why should anyone care which celebrity endorses which candidate?""

Because millions and millions of people *look up to this celebrity as a person.*"
7127,You're kidding me. Part of the reasons Swifties have been so annoying is because they're adults.
7128,"Taylor Swift is older than you think, probably 2/3's of her followers are over 18, probably 1/3 are over 27."
7129,How out of touch can you be
7130,I teach college and my students are her target audience...and they vote.
7131,"Are you aware of how many followers she has? I am not trying to dunk on you because I was not aware of how many Swifties there are and how dedicated they are until recently. If even 20% of them, which is probably a conservative estimate, are eligible to vote in the 2024 US Presidential Election then this is big news."
7132,Better late than never and I won’t begrudge her the company she keeps if she’s willing to come out and openly endorse Kamala to rally her army of millions of Swifties
7133,"Judging by the fact Kamala walked out to The Man and that Harris/Walz are selling friendship bracelets, I imagine this was pre-prepared and coordinated with the Democrats weeks ago, rather than a response to her going and watching tennis…"
7134,The only people that it’s late for are the people that were expecting a celebrity endorsement. The Swifties are tapped in- nothing Swift related makes it past them.
7135,Taylor had a totally different box from where Brittney Mahomes was at. Did they hangout after the game?
7136,"It's a master class in timing. I thought if it was going to happen it would happen later, but he just got the shit kicked out of him he's laying on the the ground bleeding mumbling something about Alf and cats and then Swift just came in and curbed stomped him while he is down. Bravo Taylor."
7137,Yeah she talked about voting early and registering. That’s why she did it now regardless of the debate.
7138,Imagine if she did show up for a Harris rally. The numbers attending would be absolutely massive; 100× whatever trump could ever pull. That would eat at him no end!
7139,"Oh god last season it was every touchdown. Their running back got his first touchdown and instead of his family cheering they showed Taylor. It isnt her fault, but the NFL producers had it bad."
7140,Agreed. Also lets agree fuck Ohio.
7141,"Probably. Don't know, was sick of the constant talking about her. I think I hate Kelci now honestly."
7142,“Who’s afraid of little old me? You should be.”
7143,"nice try:

https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2023/03/14/more-than-half-of-us-adults-say-theyre-taylor-swift-fans-survey-finds/"
7144,The timing was pretty perfect; it's a few weeks out from the registration deadlines in 30 day cut-off states like FL.  Enough time to get it done but not so far ahead that the message to register will get stale before those deadlines.  I think a good chunk of the votes that she precipitates will be new registrations and inspiring people to get that paperwork in on time is going to be heaviest lift of the whole process.
7145,lol  please do tell the math in her jet usage vs. the methods you're suggesting offset it.
7146,"If they turn out at the polls… that’s always, always, *always* the question"
7147,"Early voting begins next week in PA and soon after elsewhere. A Swift endorsement today could lead to locked in Gen Z voters and GOTV volunteers for the duration. If she waited, you miss that window."
7148,"Thanks for the good discussion, versus most of the responses that don't acknowledge that there are tricky trade-offs involved."
7149,Hes fyred 
7150,So what you are saying is that it’s a big deal because too many voters care too much about what celebrities think?
7151,"I don’t quite buy that the influence of celebrity endorsement is that huge. 

Sure, influencers and whatever may impact on certain beliefs or ideology, but implying something like “a huge chunk of people will vote for x candidate because this huge artist endorsed the candidate” is a stretch."
7152,[deleted]
7153,[deleted]
7154,"I can't understand the notion that having a friend who has opposed politics is impossible. One of my best friends is a trump guy. He isn't wearing the hats or going to rallies buying shoes or NFTs. But he will be voting for him. 


We agree to disagree on politics. When we discuss it, we always keep it civil, even if we do throw some fun jabs about gaffes. 


Can it be difficult sometimes? Yes. Is it still with it to maintain my friendship? Absolutely. We've been friends for two decades. Nothing is changing that any time soon. 


Sometimes, friendship is weird as fuck like that.

Edit: Really? Getting down votes for having a healthy friendship?"
7155,Wwe sells those bracelets too. It’s just a product
7156,Tennis….
7157,Or the reverse- with surprise Eras Tour guest VP Kamala Harris! Maybe they can do a duet.
7158,"49ers fan, fuck both you guys but also let's vote this orange asshole out of office."
7159,"Bears fan living in Cincinnati, who has come to love/hate the Bengals as well. And I'll even jump into the fuck Ohio agreement. Except Cincy, it's like a little bubble from the rest of the shit show of the state."
7160,"As a Lions fan, can we get all the Midwest football fans to join us in a hearty ""Fuck Ohio!""?"
7161,"Eagles fan, so fuck all youse. I mean I’m still going to vote with you guys, but don’t think this is going to be a habit, being nice and all."
7162,Swifts influence resulted in the biggest number of people registering to vote ever in a single hour.   She will absolutely have an impact and is standing up for women’s rights.
7163,[deleted]
7164,https://www.green.earth/blog/taylor-swifts-eras-tour-its-carbon-footprint-and-offset-strategies
7165,Good point. I was not aware. Thanks.
7166,Yes
7167,Yes and no. Her endorsement will most likely energize a lot of young people to vote who may have otherwise stayed home.
7168,I don’t think in this case.
7169,Let’s see how many brand new people register to vote in the next few days.
7170,"A huge swath of the country voted for trump on name recognition alone. Before that, huge numbers voted for Bush because of his name. Before that, it was Reagan. Do you see a pattern?"
7171,"The 1/3 part, yeah."
7172,She's been a star for literal decades. I followed her when she was younger and I'm now 30. You only have to be 18 to vote. 
7173,You know you only have to be 18 to vote right? And her break out songs came out like 16 years ago? So do some math
7174,Not everyone’s fine being friends with someone that supports a bigoted wannabe fascist
7175,"I upvote you kind sir, believe me I have my own experiences with conservative MAGA people. Many of the people on my job are them and oftentimes I can be civil and reasonable with them.

Most of the reasons they want Trump in office is because they had more money in their pockets while he was there. It’s all personal benefit stuff. I just nod and agree with them since they are so thick."
7176,"I agree with you, and I think this is kind of thing that is getting lost with social media “friendships”"
7177,"that’s different to openly embracing someone, whose endorsement was very publicly accepted by trump."
7178,"> Getting down votes for having a healthy friendship?

Being friends with someone who supports a racist, rapist, misogynist, felon who also stole money from a children's charity does not sound like a healthy friendship."
7179,"Interesting, I only follow the football side of things, I didn't even know there was a US open until your post and then saw it on TMZ, thank you"
7180,"The remaining US dates are in Miami, New Orleans and Indianapolis. Miami gives one a few ideas... Not sure if Swift would want to spring a political candidate on her ticket-paying audience, though, no matter how much they are likely to support Harris."
7181,"Seahwaks fan that has issues with all you guys (OK, not you, Ravens fan, you're cool) and is in total agreement. Vote in November to not only keep Trump out of office, but to vote in a woman more than qualified to take the presidential oath."
7182,"Jets fan who really fucking hates the Niners this week..and every other team listed here because you’ve all shellacked us in recent history. Thank you all for being on the right side of history politically, even if I abhor your football affiliations."
7183,"As a Packers fan I hate your team, but I also hate the color orange and fascism. 🤝"
7184,"Well if it didnt have an effect, then celebrity endorsements wouldn’t be a thing 😙"
7185,"that's the strategy I expected....I thought it was a green approach to concert going but actually just throwing money at purchasing ""carbon offsets"" that supposedly trickle down to appear to show offset and feel better."
7186,Well that’s really depressing.
7187,[deleted]
7188,[deleted]
7189,"I have a neighbor who is the sweetest lady ever, she supports Trump. She's not a bigot or hateful or anything. She's just dumb."
7190,"Right? This is a real person that I see in real life that I have real love for. He was my boss for 2 years at a group home. He's a good man who has used his opportunities to make a difference in the lives of children. I'm 100% sure that he wanted me around so that the kids had a progressive POV in the home. ""Iron sharpens iron,"" as the saying goes."
7191,"They could just arrange for Kamala to attend one of the shows with her husband. 

She doesn’t need to come on stage. Just attend the show, enjoy the music and smile and wave. 

She can look relatable, real, and human. Traits that are lacking from the Republican candidates for President and Vice President."
7192,I mean you can't exactly hate ravens fans. You guys sign alot of our former players. XD
7193,[deleted]
7194,Well until there’s a green way to travel with a giant pop show with 100s of staff around the world this is about the best anyone can do.
7195,"Depends on your outlook. Most peoples' reasons for voting a particular way are pretty bad and poorly thought out anyway. I mean, one of the strongest indicators of electoral results is gas prices, which has a lot less to do with the president than people think. The economy, the biggest issue for most voters, is so much bigger than a president's policies. People vote for who their friends like, who their church likes, who their family likes, etc. They vote based on vibes and they vote superficially. It's just part of democracy."
7196,It's depressing but we need all the support we can get against Trump. Politics is also a popularity contest not just a policy contest I would love a world where politics was only about policy but we don't live in that type of world.
7197,"The 1/3 part I was making up.

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift?wprov=sfla1

This show how old she is and how popular she has been in the past 10+ years."
7198,"Lmao, yeah I was making the 1/3 of her fans being over 27 part up, but it's [likely higher](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.abc.net.au/article/103457252)."
7199,"How is that relevant to how old her fan base is?

My answer, either way, doesn't change the fact that the claim that most of her fans aren't old enough to vote doesn't really hold up to scrutiny."
7200,"It's the additional registrations and attendance that will matter, not any conversions from one to the other. 

There's bound to be some articles coming out soon that will analyze any bump in numbers, and hopefully explaining their statistical methods of how they know those fluctuations can be attributed to this."
7201,"I was once told by a relative this. 

“In the modern day, where ignorance and arrogance is celebrated, it can seem pointless to be intelligent. It is not. The greatest achievement of humanity is our capacity for thought and comprehension. It’s why Trump hurts you so much. To your mind, someone as idiotic and ignorant as Trump should not be allowed to get this far, and you’d be right in that. In a sane country this would have ended before it even began, but this country isn’t sane. Hasn’t been since the towers fell. 

We are drunk on blood and addicted to rage. The media knows it and exploits it. It’s your job as a smarter man to make your own judgements, but I think you have already. I am not a genius, but the smartest thing I can tell you is this.

Comprehension is both a blessing and a curse.”"
7202,"> He's a good man who has used his opportunities to make a difference in the lives of children.

So he's a good many who makes a difference in the lives of children while supporting a man who literally stole money from a children's charity? You realize how insane that sounds right?"
7203,"Yep. People are complicated, and often 
compartmentalize their beliefs. The reality is that people frequently behave in a way that contradicts what they claim they believes in (in this case, via voting preferences). I know extremely nice people who voted for Trump. I definitely didn’t like that they did, and told them, but I also didn’t cut them out of my life. Sometimes it takes time for people to connect the dots. I was lucky when I was younger and was exposed to critical thinking skills that helped me try to align my actions andy sense of morality. But not everyone has those skills. 

Again, I still believe it’s nuts that people think Trump is a viable candidate to help our country…but sometimes the only way to get people to come around is to just be human to each other."
7204,Please don’t bring up our trade prowess. Or lack thereof.
7205,Well to be fair Trump started it with his dumb AI posts
7206,"Democracy relies on voters to do their best to figure out what’s best for the society. That’s why we give them the power to vote, rather than giving the power to only selected individuals.

If one thinks that gas price is the most important issue, then sure. At least they think addressing that issue is critical.

 This isn’t just about presidential election. This is about any election.  

Relying on others to do the leg work of figuring out who would be the best candidate is just lazy and irresponsible as a member of democracy. I agree that there are people who vote for whoever their friends/family vote, and I’d honestly feel sad to see that."
7207,"That's fine. Do you think those people are now changing their decision from Trump to Harris because of Taylor swift?

I don't, I think all those people were probably going to vote Harris anyway."
7208,"You brought up your personal experience, so I asked you a personal question. I think that's fairly relevant for the information you provided in this context. Anyway, I'm not in disagreement. I answered with fair. Meaning, you had a point and I acknowledged it."
7209,At least your not Cleveland.
7210,The amount of people who do what you want and actually dive into the issues to form their own opinions is miniscule. I just kind of accept it as what it is. Democracy is flawed but it's better than the alternatives.
7211,We haven’t done any of this since we allowed candidate Richard Nixon to get away with stopping Vietnam War negotiations because he promised them a better dead
7212,"What you're saying makes sense, it's just sadly not how a large swath of the country operates. Yes, people should do their own research. Yes, people should stay at least modestly informed on government and even foreign affairs. People should do the leg work. Unfortunately, by and large, most regular working people do not. People get their info in bursts these days and typically from their social nets or social media. 

Taylor Swift, who has a large and loyal following, has a voice that can reach a lot of people who would otherwise not really care about politics. That's actually a really good thing. I think getting more people to care about / pay attention to politics is a necessary and patriotic thing, and probably a step in the right direction towards the way of life you're hoping we someday reach. She even says in her endorsement to do your research and see which candidate speaks to you. These are good things to say to people who otherwise wouldn't turn out or be interested at all."
7213,"It’s sad but it’s reality. The hard truth is that there are a LOT of very dumb, ignorant adults in this world that are oblivious to policy. And yes they vote Democrat too, especially if a celebrity tells them to."
7214,"When I was younger, Taylor Swift fans were overwhelmingly conservative Christians, but then again I did grow up in NC. I'm out of the loop as to who her fans are now, but I would wager that a significant portion are still conservative Christians as Trump himself and others have been seeking her endorsement going so far as faking it. So yeah this endorsement can change some minds, but it can also encourage young people to go out and vote, which is a huge problem already."
7215,"Agreed. And by the way, I do appreciate your source because it gives US fanbase specifically."

7217,"If this doesn’t do a before and after in the polls, nothing will.

She should be up 5 points nationally and pull away in the states that are close. Trump literally had a worse debate performance than Biden did."
7218,Abortion is healthcare. This is just a medical fact at this point.
7219,"In a sane country of high IQ citizens, this would be enough to guarantee a Harris win. But unfortunaly, we live in the USA..."
7220,"I can’t understand how anyone can feel he “won”.  Even if you don’t like Kamala he didn’t answer anything and straight up said he doesn’t even have a plan, just a concept of one."

7222,And that's after nine years.
7223,"Because people who vote for him are looking for anything to latch onto, and they’ll say all his rambling about Harris being the worst thing ever means he won"

7227,"Article highlights:

>The caption didn’t mention Donald Trump’s running mate, J. D. Vance—and it didn’t need to. Anyone who follows politics knows that Vance has repeatedly suggested that childless women are “miserable,” and that people who aren’t parents do not have a “personal and direct stake” in the future of America. In a 2021 interview with Fox News, he summed up his views with a memorable phrase: that the country was being run by a “bunch of childless cat ladies.”
>
>Swift’s response—wryly applying that label to herself, as a successful pop star with a gazillion fans, a billion-dollar net worth, and a handsome football-player boyfriend—suggests that she might be the last living exponent of the Obama-era ideal of staying classy in the face of provocation. Remember “When they go low, we go high”? Very 2016. The Democrats’ convention in August showed that the party has given up on trying to rise above Trump’s outrages and has instead embraced being salty in return: The high/lowlight was when Senator Elizabeth Warren, 75, made a couch joke. Even Barack Obama slyly referred to the small size of Trump’s … crowds. (The Democrats liked that one so much, they have turned it into an advertisement.)
>
>By contrast, Swift’s endorsement was incredibly restrained. She made a positive case for the Democrats’ policy platform on the issues she cares about, with only a glancing reference to Trump’s “chaos,” and ended with a suggestion that fans register to vote, do their own research, and make their own choices. This was not a thunderous denunciation of Trump as an urgent threat to democracy. Nor did it use any of the language popular with left-leaning online sites in the late 2010s and 2020s, where writers agonized over staying friends with Republican voters, or whether to talk to their Trumpy uncle at Thanksgiving. Swift’s statement merely outlined her own decision, and acknowledged that other people might make a different one.
>
>That is more radical than it might seem—because Swift will take criticism from both sides as a result. Mainstream Democrats, of course, are delighted: When Walz received the news live on MSNBC, he clenched his fist to his heart in appreciation. But some of her most ardent fans will find the endorsement tepid, and her criticisms of Trump and Vance too muted. Plenty of leftists will be angry that she didn’t mention Gaza. The very online right, meanwhile, is likely to lose its mind that the endorsement exists at all.
>
>...
>
>What is so striking about her statement, though, is not that a 34-year-old childless woman would support the Democrats—in demographic terms, that makes perfect sense. What is most interesting is her tone. Harris has largely ditched Biden’s strategy of warning about Trump’s threat to democracy, in favor of running an old-school campaign about values and competence. In a similar vein, Swift has provided an understated condemnation of the Republican platform and a measured endorsement of the Democrats. Plus, of course, that one precision-targeted jab on behalf of childless cat ladies everywhere.

In the parlance of the summer of 2024, this was a very demure, very mindful endorsement of Harris and a takedown of Vance."
7228,I believe she knew she was going to endorse Kamala the whole time. She was just busy with her Europe tour and her marketing and PR team are like really fuckin good at their jobs.

7231,"One cult leader makes fun of another cult leader, news at 11"
7232,"yep, that last line was a stellar class of Gotcha"
7233,"Taylor Swift is extremely well liked:

>Pop star Taylor Swift notched the highest net favorability rating of any figure tested in the latest NBC News national poll, with 40% of registered voters saying they have a positive view of Swift, versus only 16% holding a negative opinion.

Deal with it."
7234,You dont have to. But you do have to accept alot of people do like her.
7235,"What makes her a cult leader? People choose to go to her concerts, but she's not attacking them if they go to someone else's."
7236,"Right. 

One cult is a massive group of airheads that obsess over a performer and media personality, adopting their entire selves to mirror that image including how they speak, dress, and treat others, who pile into arenas to worship and hang on every single word posted on social media.

and the others are Swifties."
7237,"I don't think the word ""cult"" means what you seem to think it means."
7238,She’s completely overrated
7239,Had me in the first half.
7240,Opinions are like assholes.
7241,That’s your opinion

And one should expect people to chime in when stating an opinion on a public forum.

Hope this helps you with your journey on the internet"
7243,I know I’m right - it’s a rather common experience

7248,Today feels like a good day
7249,">*Administration approves 10th offshore wind project; previous Administration approved none*

>*With this approval, Nation has permitted 15 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity, as progress continues toward President Biden’s goal of deploying 30 gigawatts by 2030*

>President Biden and Vice President Harris’s leadership has catalyzed the nation’s offshore wind industry which is creating good-paying and union jobs, establishing and growing new industries in the United States, providing reliable clean power for homes and businesses, strengthening Made in America supply chains, tackling the climate crisis, and helping lower costs for families.

>The Biden-Harris Administration has built the offshore wind industry from the ground up. Right now, American workers across manufacturing, shipbuilding, construction, and other sectors are building this new industry. The Administration continues to use every tool available —including leveraging historic resources from President Biden’s Investing in America agenda — to seize near- and long-term offshore wind opportunities across America that will create new jobs for our communities.  

>At the beginning of this Administration, there were no approved commercial-scale offshore wind projects in federal waters in the United States. Recognizing the urgency of catalyzing this industry to generate clean energy and combat climate change, President Biden set an ambitious goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind in the United States by 2030, while protecting biodiversity and promoting ocean co-use. **Today [September 5th], the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing the 10th approval of a commercial-scale offshore wind project. With this approval, the nation has now approved more than 15 gigawatts of offshore wind projects – enough to power 5.25 million homes, and equivalent to half of the capacity needed to achieve the 30 gigawatt goal.**  

>US Wind’s project offshore Maryland – approved today by the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) – will provide up to 2,200 megawatts of clean, reliable renewable energy for the Delmarva Peninsula and power up to 770,000 homes. The development and construction phases of the project are estimated to support up to an estimated 2,679 jobs annually over seven years.

>Overall, successfully deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind will help power 10 million homes with clean energy, support 77,000 jobs, avoid 78 million metric tons of CO2 emissions, and spur $12 billion per year in private investment in offshore wind projects.

>Today’s [September 5th] announcement builds on significant progress that the Biden-Harris Administration has made to accelerate project reviews while protecting communities and our environment. Recent data demonstrates that the Biden-Harris Administration is delivering more projects, more quickly than the previous Administration.

*Advancing Offshore Wind off Every Coast*

>Since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, the Department of the Interior has held five offshore wind lease auctions providing more than 1.3 million new acres for development – including a record-breaking sale offshore New York and New Jersey that generated more than $4 billion in winning bids. The Department of the Interior also held first-ever sales offshore the Pacific and Gulf Coasts; held the first sale in the Central Atlantic region in a decade; and announced the first-ever sales offshore Oregon and in the Gulf of Maine. Earlier this year, Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland announced a new five-year offshore wind leasing schedule that aims to hold up to 12 potential offshore wind sales through 2028, including potential first-ever sales in HawaiˋI and a U.S. Territory. Because of the Administration’s progress on permitting the nation’s first offshore wind projects and leasing new areas, the total U.S. offshore wind project pipeline now exceeds 80 gigawatts, enough to power more than 26 million homes if fully developed.

*Investing in Workers and Communities*

>The Administration is advancing offshore wind development in a way that will maximize benefits for local communities and create good-paying jobs for American workers, including by harnessing a range of clean energy tax credits from President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda and federal financing programs across the Departments of Energy, the Interior, Commerce, and Transportation. The Department of the Interior has also introduced innovative provisions in lease sales supporting workforce training and union-built projects, domestic supply chain development, and community benefit agreements —including with Tribes and stakeholder groups. The Energy Department has charted a path to grow and train an American workforce to fill tens of thousands of jobs across the offshore wind industry. The Administration’s Federal-State Offshore Wind Implementation Partnership is working to strengthen regional collaboration on offshore wind supply chain development, to unlock more American job opportunities. With these efforts driving progress, offshore wind investments announced during the Biden-Harris Administration now include more than $6.9 billion across 19 manufacturing facilities and 15 ports, as well as 25 new offshore wind vessels being built in 8 different states, totaling thousands of new jobs.

*Accelerating Offshore Wind Permitting*

>Today’s tenth offshore wind project approval, reflecting collaboration across federal agencies, is part of comprehensive Administration efforts to improve the federal permitting process, including: investing over $1 billion through Inflation Reduction Act funds to hire experts and invest in new technologies to expedite reviews; passing the first reforms to modernize the National Environmental Policy Act for the first time in 50 years; and using executive authorities, wherever possible, to improve permitting and environmental review processes. Earlier this year, the Department of the Interior finalized a rule that is expected to save offshore wind developers about $1.9 billion over 20 years by modernizing regulations for offshore renewable energy development. The Department of the Interior is also developing programmatic environmental impact statements for the New York Bight and California offshore wind lease areas to create efficiencies for individual project reviews. Additionally, BOEM and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a joint strategy to protect and promote the recovery of endangered North Atlantic right whales while responsibly developing offshore wind energy. These agencies are also deploying Inflation Reduction Act funding and working with industry and environmental stakeholders to advance whale detection and monitoring technologies.

*Strengthening Transmission and Port Infrastructure for Offshore Wind*

>The Departments of the Interior and Energy released *An Action Plan for Offshore Wind Transmission Development in the U.S. Atlantic Region*, a set of bold actions that will catalyze grid upgrades to boost offshore wind energy, strengthen the domestic supply chain, and create good-paying, union jobs. Similar efforts are underway along the West and Gulf coasts. These efforts are funded from the Inflation Reduction Act for offshore wind and interregional transmission analyses and convenings. This summer, the Department of Energy announced federal transmission investments that will help connect 4,800 megawatts of offshore wind to the New England grid and provide economic development grants to several communities that will host offshore wind transmission infrastructure. To help build out the port capacity needed for offshore wind manufacturing and project construction, the Department of Transportation has awarded more than $675 million in grants for East Coast and West Coast ports to support offshore wind activities.

*Advancing Floating Offshore Wind Innovation and Deployment*

>Deep-water areas that require floating platforms are home to two-thirds of America’s offshore wind energy potential, including along the West Coast and in the Gulf of Maine. To seize these opportunities, the Department of the Interior set a goal to deploy 15 gigawatts of floating offshore wind capacity by 2035—enough to power over five million American homes. And the Administration launched an interagency Floating Offshore Wind Shot, which seeks to reduce the cost of floating offshore wind energy by more than 70 percent by 2035. The Departments of Energy, the Interior, Commerce, and Transportation have already achieved over 50 milestones and dedicated over $950 million to advance the Floating Offshore Wind Shot and American competitiveness on floating offshore wind turbine design, development, and manufacturing. Last month, the Department of the Interior announced the execution of the nation’s first floating offshore wind energy research lease offshore Maine."
7250,More please and thank you.
7251,"Offshore wind is awesome.

Plus, it’s so far out that it’s not going to be in anyone’s way."

>Childless Cat Lady

JD Vance can't escape from this ever. lol"
7254,Awww shit look what you made me do.
7255,She signed it as Childless Cat Lady. That’s quite a bit of votes for that alone.
7256,Trump just got Swiftvoted.
7257,"As a childless cat man, I approve this message."
7258,I think she’s just made 5-15 million young women vote.
7259,"44% of adults call themselves Swifties.

[More than half of U.S. adults call themselves fans of Taylor Swift - CBS Minnesota (cbsnews.com)](https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/more-than-half-of-u-s-adults-call-themselves-fans-of-taylor-swift/)

Taylor's endorsement will certainly have an impact with any Swiftie that may have been on the fence until now.

Donnie and MAGA fucked with another strong, badass woman and they will lose because of it."
7260,I can finally stop hearing people pretend she's secretly MAGA now. When that was so obviously never true.
7261,[deleted]
7262,She got 20% rise in the nfl viewership . I think she can swing this too
7263,"Yeah but Trump has Hulk Hogan and Mike Lindell. Don't those two cancel out Swift? 

/s"
7264,Game over for Trump
7265,"Hopefully encourage younger voter turnout.


Trump is going to lose his fucking mind over this."
7266,Imma say yes
7267,"I feel like if she waited, it wouldn’t have the same impact as now after the debate vs a few weeks from now.

This was a hard disrespect to Donolds performance and speech, live, by one of the worlds most popular women. That’s a punch to the gut and a knee to the face."
7268,"It will get some more young people to vote, it’s also about getting people registered"
7269,Honestly most of her fans would support Harris no matter what. It does however cause people who likely weren't going to vote and didn't pay any attention to the election to decide to go vote. If she could push people to register she'd be a massive influence.
7270,"LOL. 

Her posing with her cat kinda sealed it."
7271,I’m surprised MSNBC chose this headline
7272,Yes. Yes it will.
7273,There it is. Thank you so much Tay Tay.
7274,Swifties! Assemble.
7275,">Will it make a difference. 

Duh? 

Taylor Swift probably could have endorsed herself and had a legitimate foot in the race. If there’s one person who has a larger cult of personality around them than Trump, it’s Swift."
7276,Good thing Trump doesn’t really know JD Vance or he’d feel really stupid about this.
7277," Biden won Arizona by only 11,000 votes!  Every vote counts."
7278,"Yes.

*Very Yes.*"
7279,Trump just felt some extra tightness in his chest.
7280,great timing waiting until around the debate instead during the dnc to endorse
7281,[friendship bracelets now available on the Harris/Walz merch store](https://store.kamalaharris.com/harris-walz-friendship-bracelet-2-pack/)
7282,Impressive.
7283,Twist the knife after getting wrecked by Harris
7284,"Childless cat lady, a Vance burn without naming him."
7285,She has 280 million followers many of which are beyond obsessed. Most the swing states were decided by what? 0.01% of that?
7286,"Will it make a difference?

...Asks the apparent boomer who doesn't seem to understand what Swifties are."
7287,Putin in absolute shambles right now.
7288,Oh man. Tonight is.... Delicious
7289,Yes it will make a difference.  Historically 18-22 year olds are an apathetic voting base.  Swift pushing people to turn up and vote will matter.
7290,Pfft. Big deal. Trump has Hulk Hogan. I’m sure the hulkamaniacs outnumber the swifties. /s
7291,"ladies, please help this country come Nov.

*a 60 yr old dude*"
7292,"And I just have to add, that her cat looks delicious! /s"
7293,"Wha???? Oh no, this will really wreck Trumpy's night after his sad weak and weird debate performance!"
7294,"She had over a quarter million likes on the post in 4 minutes. Clearly, someone is listening."
7295,She's the princess of America. Prob the only celeb endorsement that counts
7296,Doesn’t matter. Vote!!!
7297,"I think it will. Anyway, good she did."
7298,Hell yes! Let's make the Swifties that cannot vote happy and keep this country moving forward!
7299,"This is more about getting people to vote rather than changing their opinions. I'm sure there are some completely apolitical people who would be swayed by a celebrity endorsement, but that's a small number. This is about left leaning individuals who normally don't take the time out of their day to vote."
7300,Give it to Ms. Swift. She knows when to strike while the iron is hot.
7301,Uhhh... Yes it will make a difference.
7302,That’s it. 3.7m likes in half hour. It is over for the orange guy.
7303,You're kidding me right? It will absolutely have a dramatic effect on voter turnout for Harris.
7304,only If you get the 18 to 25 demographic to vote.
7305,"**Her real power will be getting young women to register**. The passion and support for Harris was already there, but translating the desire to wear a t-shirt, recite a slogan, post supportive messages on social media etc. all counts, BUT ONLY IF IT'S FOLLOWED UP BY VOTING. That last step is always the difficulty with younger people. 

Taylor just got 10,000,000 + young women ready to make a real difference on election day by  overwhelming the old, white, male vote."
7306,NYT: The most popular celebrity in the world just endorsed Kamala Harris. Here’s why that’s bad for Kamala Harris
7307,"She has a ton of draw and can make her fans go out and vote. So yes, I believe it can make a difference"
7308,I really picture JD Vance team angrily slow turning toward him after reading the “childless cat lady” signature.
7309,It definitely will. She's essentially the most famous person in the country.
7310,It definitely won’t hurt.
7311,"Typically speaking, endorsements have little to no impact. Yes, when Oprah, Hulk Hogan, or Beyonce endorses someone, it will trigger dozens, hundreds, potentially thousands of people across the country to vote for their candidate of choice, but when you divide them out among 50 states, and then only focus on the swing states, those swings in voters are largely irrelevant. 

Having said that, there are celebrities in every generation who have enough of a fervent fan base that their endorsement can be a potential scale tipper, and this generation's celebrity that likely fits that bill is Swift. Her endorsement might actually push tens of thousands, maybe over a hundred thousand people who otherwise were not going to vote or were undecided/voting third party to instead vote for Harris. With the tight margins that exist in swing states, a Taylor Swift endorsement that leads to a few thousand more Harris voters in say Pennsylvania or North Carolina could be the deciding factor."
7312,"> Will it make a difference?

The Swifty swing vote"
7313,"Trump didn’t prepare. His entire speech was lies, finger-pointing, and honestly a bunch of bullshit. Whether you are a democrat or a republican, the choice was clear. Just as it was for me when Biden stumbled at his debate, I wouldn’t or had a hard time voting for him. However, we deserve honest, clear, and policy driven candidates. Trump is a fucking joke. An absolute fucking joke. What a loser."
7314,Yes.
7315,Taylor Swift: Harris campaign surrogate?
7316,Yes
7317,This is pretty huge.
7318,"Yeah, and the funny thing is there aren’t all that many things that would make a bigger difference than this."
7319,"It matters a lot. People might’ve been like eh too much effort to register/vote, I’ll do it later, is Kamala really the best choice etc. Swift’s endorsement will get more people out to vote. It’s in the thousands, it matters a lot."
7320,Yes. Next question.
7321,"Just her reminding people they have to register to be able to vote will help. Many young Swifties who don't have political parents, or have conservative parents may not have known that. More young people turn 18 every year and she has a huge following."
7322,"Yes, yes it does"
7323,"It makes me sad that the US (and world in general) work they in this pathetically frivolous manner… but yes, it’s to be expected it will have an effect on US voters. Luckily, stupidity favors the lesser evil in this case."
7324,I think it will motivate a non-zero number of young women to “do their research” and conclude that Kamala represents their interests better.
7325,Motivating new young voters is always a good thing for democracy.
7326,"As a childless but coton de tulear mom, I approve this message"
7327,It won’t hurt.
7328,"It was the best timing possible to do that. It elevated the momentum. Early voting is starting, and she advised her fans to do so."
7329,"It probably does in that Taylor probably read the tea leaves first. If she's finally endorsing her, that means she and her camp feel Harris has a good chance to win."
7330,Oh f
7331,Can’t hurt
7332,"Jeez, if the play list selection on my car radio matters, it will definitely make a difference."
7333,Yes
7334,Yes
7335,She will deliver Pennsylvania
7336,"I don’t know why it would, but sure. She sings songs, i wonder how the fuck that matters. Jk i know how it matters but it’s sad."
7337,I think she waited way too long. She needs to do some GOTV if she wants it to make a difference. Waiting until news is being flooded with debate info isn’t the ideal time.
7338,"T+K, total knockout. Esp. If Swift can mobilize her younger fans to register & vote."
7339,Her endorsement is more powerful than the shitshow Trump put on at the debate.
7340,"Donald Trump knew enough about how much power a Taylor Swift endorsement carries, that he attempted to manipulate people into believing he had her endorsement.  Despite the obvious danger that she would publicly call it out and endorse Harris.

Trump threw that Hail Mary because he knew he needed it.  The *ghost* of Swift's endorsement was enough for him to overextend."
7341,"It’s not just the post.  She also allowed Harris to exit the debate to one of her songs and I would assume that the Harris campaign asked her permission to sell friendship bracelets as a fundraiser. 

 "
7342,Sure won’t hurt
7343,"The ""will it make a difference"" is so unnecessary in this headline."
7344,It may motivated unregistered voters to do so and vote but the electoral college is the true hurdle. As we know the popular vote can mean nothing.
7345,"Whatever the result, women will be to blame."
7346,"Yes I think it matters. Taylor appeals to a segment of the population that tends to be disengaged from politics, unless of course Taylor tells them to go vote."
7347,"Well, it certainly won’t hurt."
7348,"Oh boy, another name added to the list of political opponents he will want jailed if he wins."
7349,I'm pretty sure the swift fans were voting for her anyway
7350,"If you need a celebrity to tell you how to vote, you probably shouldn’t be voting."
7351,"Can we get a joint Kamala Taylor campaign concert please?

These women should break all existing records for “size”"
7352,That’s a lot of young votes Taylor has influence over. Definitely makes a difference.
7353,"I think it plays to her demo which is young white women.   That definitely matters for this election.    

For someone like me, a middle aged black man it’s not really a game changer but hell I was already voting for Harris"
7354,Why do people give a crap what some singer says about who she is voting for? If people can't figure out on their own that Harris is the better choice then that's just pitiful.
7355,"Like she was going to endorse anyone else. Anyways, who the fuck cares who celebrities endorse. Think for yourselves."
7356,Yes the biggest celebrity endorsing a candidate will matter as it gives fans who may not care about politics much a sway on the issue
7357,JD off fucking a couch while angrily weeping rn.
7358,"Of course it will make a difference , this is all TS does is make a difference !"
7359,Sure will. Engage youth and send the Republicans into the trashcan of history.
7360,"The timing of this endorsement was 100% arranged ahead of time. It was calculated to get people talking about the debate who may not normally have cared. If the top headline is ""Harris wins debate"" politically unengaged voters might not care enough to click on it. The top headlines right now are ""Taylor Swift endorses Harris following debate,"" which, since Swift has way more mainstream appeal than either candidate, will drive clicks and ultimately drive more people to pay attention to Trump's largest political loss of the campaign.

I work in the communications field, and trust me when I say Harris' team is currently conducting a master class on how to dominate the news cycle."
7361,Taylor Swift singing at the inauguration or adjacent event? For sure now
7362,This will make a big difference. Her post with the picture of her and a cat and signing as “childless cat lady” is brilliant. I will be streaming her music today to show some appreciation!
7363,Omg they had that queued up. I truly hope so at this point because the meat bags and cancer riddled assholes running the media are not doing future generations any justice.
7364,"IMHO yes it will, she has the power to motivate young women to vote like nobody else."
7365,Did she need to see the full debate to make that decision? After a weekend of hanging out with MAGA Maholmes.
7366,[deleted]
7367,[deleted]
7368,"The last 2 elections were very close. The Electoral College made it seem like larger margins, but if you drill down to many swing state results, the margins were tiny.

I don't think celebrity endorsements make much difference, but even a small fraction could be make-or-break here. I still doubt Taylor Swift will be the difference maker, but it doesn't seem impossible."
7369,"If our democracy relies on a country singer endorsement, we’re already screwed. 

People who vote based on celebrity endorsements shouldn’t be allowed to vote. Pure idiocy."
7370,"I would like to say that no it won't make a difference? Who the hell listens to a pop singer about where to cast their vote for their country leader?

But sadly I know better, and I know a ton of people who really don't give a shit will be swayed by this.

It's good in this instance I guess if it stops the orange poo flinger from taking office but it feels yucky."
7371,Not really
7372,Nope
7373,"anyone else find it scary that people base their vote in such an important election on a celebrity? Of course the same goes for people who base their voting on what their minister says, or jebus."
7374,No.
7375,I don’t know if I’d be gloating about the most annoying person in America supporting me but cool
7376,Panic time. Call the swifties!!!
7377,A lot of TS's followers are not old enough to vote. They need to convince their parents
7378,[deleted]
7379,[deleted]
7380,Why should I care what she thinks if she doesn’t care about our environment?
7381,"Oh man, it just keeps getting worse for that guy and in 3 weeks or so he's got to debate Tim Walz and he's gonna get fucking wrecked and look like an asshole."
7382,I’d argue at this point that JD Vance has done more to help Kamala get elected than he has Trump.
7383,"Thank you for being such a weird asshole, couchfucker!"
7384,Vance can’t get off the couch on CNN. He couldn’t stand up.
7385,"Okay, good"
7386,JD Vance tried to flip the script on this by pushing that fake story of immigrants eating cats and pretending like he’s some protector of pet cats
7387,Looks like Taylor won’t be touring in Springfield
7388,"I was listening to one of my favorite podcasts (No such thing as a fish) which is based in England and when the word couch came up one of the hosts mentioned Vance.  And then they talked about it for about 10 minutes.  

He's a worldwide joke."
7389,"I hope so! Look at the demographics of her fans:

Here are the most Taylor Swift-obsessed states, according to 2023 JackpotCity’s study on Google search data surrounding the pop star:

California, 1,436,100 average monthly searches

7407,I think her endorsement matters less in flipping people and more so in turning out voters who would likely be Harris voters who may not have registered
7408,"It was a surprisingly well thought out text.  She didn’t oppose any one voting for Trump, but gave her reason for voting for Harris.  Never heard her speak much before, so don’t know if that was her or partly her PR team."
7409,"If the younger gens show up and vote.  I am a young gen -x and I organize volunteer activities. My generation kind of sucks. The younger gens are increasing my best volunteers. They show up, roll up their sleeves, and get to work. I think polls may be missing these voters."
7410,Wait till you realise Swift has been entertaining 3 generations of people...
7411,Oprah is hosting a virtual event next week for Harris. Between these two women I think Harris should get a good sized boost.
7412,I think it matters with young white women more than anything.
7413,I don't think there are many Swifties on the fence.  The endorsement might help encourage them to actually turn out and vote though.
7414,I think it was smart to post her post-debate response. Hopefully this causes those sitting on the fence to watch the debate themselves and not look at curated cuts that may not fully shed light on the questions/responses.
7415,There are people who still think Trump is the real president behind the scenes. They are a lost cause.
7416,It was an insane thing to think given that she endorsed Biden in 2020.
7417,"Those type of people genuinely believe that only brown, black and queer people are left-leading. A straight white lady dating a football player just has to be on their side. Not having her shatters their worldview."
7418,"A good number of comments on r/taylorswift were saying that she was publicly endorsing Kamala while secretly voting Trump … because that makes sense? If it was in her best interest for Trump to win (ignoring the fact that she spelled out exactly why she was voting for Kamala), why would she encourage her fans to vote against that? She would have been better off saying nothing"
7419,"Every single one of those people was a wilfully gibbering moron. 


Getting to that conclusion takes a level of stupidity, a pattern of inexcusably bad reasoning, that one has to cultivate."
7420,"Her music isn’t to my taste, but I have mad respect for her. Fucking over Scooter after what he did and now this, is pure gold. I will contribute my one like to her account."
7421,"At 3.5 million and still climbing quick… it’s going to make a huge difference. Plus, this timing leaves a good month for registration with all of her young followers, especially in those deep red and swing states. 😊"
7422,And Obama's half brother and Walz's estranged brother!
7423,Ummmm KID ROCK???
7424,You left out Elon and RFKJr.
7425,People need time to register. Her endorsement is about people who haven't voted before.
7426,Yeah but this basically makes all the head lines taylor endorses harris after the debate. Signaling a clear harris win. Instead of allowing the result of the debate to be spun in any other way
7427,"I think it was a good time, because she points back to the debate. This will force those undecided voters to potentially review the debate to see how it went down and may help influence their decision."
7428,The post she put up today apparently linked to voter registration websites. She's gotten people to register before.
7429,I agree. Let’s embrace Harris not give hope to trump shit for clicks.
7430,how very cnn of them.
7431,"I’m just imagining the pitch meeting between Taylor and the Kamala campaign, laying out the timeline for the endorsement and the merch options to do the absolute most damage to Trump. Delicious."
7432,Exactly.   Her endorsement is huge.
7433,Who names their cat Tonight?
7434,lol BROTHER!!!
7435,This 52 year old dude seconds this
7436,"to be fair, it's a lot easier for someone to like a post then to actually get up and vote"
7437,"I think it was always the plan to do it after the debate.  If things had gone poorly it would have dominated the news cycle.  Since Harris so clearly won, it just enhances it."
7438,"lol.  
She was always voting for Harris and she was always going to endorse her publicly. 

The timing is strategic, not an act of tea leaf reading."
7439,"And Texas.

And Florida.

And Ohio."
7440,She runs a more profitable business than Trump
7441,"I disagree, the momentum post Biden resigned is starting to flatten at a +4 for Harris.

This debate + Taylor is a launching pad to reignite momentum for a stronger lead."
7442,"Doesn't matter when she speaks, the fans are there to listen honestly.  She could have done this in a month and still gotten the same eyes from her target audience. Although I really would have loved for her to do some more GOTV stuff while on tour but don't think this delay really detracts from the gravity of the endorsement overall.  Plus linking to voting resources directly in her profile & story definitely will get people to those resources."
7443,"Many of her fans are GenZ and millennials who live in Republican rural bubbles, so I would not necessarily agree"
7444,"Well, I’d say Trump has more power to motivate young women to vote, but the two of them together should be a good one-two punch."
7445,"Doubtful, she probably just waited to embellish the debate win with her endorsement.  It really rubs it in."
7446,I think it was agreed with the Harris campaign.  Harris left the stage to a Swift song and is now selling friendship bracelets.  
7447,"You know Harris KNEW about this beforehand, right? They literally had Taylor Swift-themed merchandise ready to drop on her campaign website. This wasn't a reactionary decision by Taylor, it was masterfully calculated by both her and Harris' team."
7448,"That is false. Deadlines for registration in battleground states are: 

- Arizona: October 7th
- Georgia: October 7th
- Michigan: Election Day before 8 PM
- Minnesota: Election Day
- Nevada: Same day during early voting or - Election Day 
- North Carolina: October 11th or same day - during early voting which is October 17th- November 2nd
- Pennsylvania: October 21st

And just for funsies: 
- Florida: October 7th
- Texas: October 7th 

Many states have different dates for online registration vs in person and different deadlines for mail in vs in person voting, so make sure to double check those based on how you’re voting this year!"
7449,Which of the states is it already too late?
7450,Ms. Swift advised everyone to do their own research and register to vote. You have problems with that?
7451,Worse is a party that puts up an unqualified candidate for Presidency based on celebrity.  And it worked in 2016.
7452,Ummm…swift has been out since 2006. Many of her followers are old enough to vote. Where you been?
7453,"Taylor Swift tickets are impossible to get.  Please, give them up and they'll immediately be taken."
7454,"Someone get their feelings hurt, show me where she hurt you"
7455,You bet but don't have any evidence?
7456,Walz will bring out the couch..
7457,"Please go look at r/trump right now. The level of coping they are doing this morning is something else. They won’t care about how bad it goes. There are grown men over there just lying to each other about how trump “demolished” Harris, even though the entire world watched him up there looking like a lunatic."
7458,"Well he already looks like an asshole, so he’s just going to get wrecked."
7459,History shows vice presidents really don't help that much. But the Republicans managed to find two that really hurt them in recent memory.
7460,A wrecked asshole?
7461,That's assuming JD Vance can get off the couch
7462,Can’t wait for that
7463,[deleted]
7464,I hope Walz will do as great as Harris did tonight!
7465,"Got my husband a ""Coach vs. Couch 2024"" t-shirt!"
7466,"Being a senator is a pretty big job. I don't understand how we get weirdos like Vance and Cruz. In a whole state, THIS was your best?"
7467,"Play on words. Kerry was ‘swiftboated’ in ‘04, a real scummy attempt to smear his military service."
7468,As a definately human person with no cats I support this message.
7469,"Another proud soon-to-married cat daddy here. My two youngins just said “fuck Trump and fuck JD, too.” Wish I got it on video."
7470,"As a parent to a human and cat (and 3 dogs), I also approve this message."
7471,That’s ok. My wife will take in multiple cats for your lack of cat.
7472,Cats are amazing pets. [Here’s an article about the joys of owning a cat](https://www.helpguide.org/wellness/pets/joys-of-owning-a-cat).
7473,"People from other counties aren't allowed to vote in US elections though.


She has a big international fan base."
7474,The turnout is going to be in all the right places
7475,Pretty much all republican votes are blind votes if you say that. No matter what atrocious thing Trump does they still vote for him.
7476,So many people just vote for a party because their parents do. This is much less worse.
7477,"Right.  Especially if she keeps encouraging her fans to register and vote.  

2020 was decided by a few thousand votes in a few swing states.  All you have to do is get about 20k more swifties to vote in each of those states, who might not have, and that's it. Game over."
7478,All you need to watch out for is when Taylor Swift posts a website to register to vote....then note the time after said post the website crashes.
7479,The youth vote alone could be massive as a result.
7480,"Agreed, and this is perhaps more important. The majoruty of Americans lean left. The democratic votes have been there to win every election since 2000, but the problem is getting people to cast them."
7481,Precisely. Swift will help push turnout for Harris.
7482,She’s an incredible songwriter who knows how to use words with surgical precision. I wouldn’t be shocked if this was 100% her writing.
7483,I have to wonder how long ago she composed that post before she pulled the trigger.
7484,Yeah. There's no way these pollsters are calling mobile phones and they wouldn't be able to if these voters weren't enrolled anyway.
7485,I’m a millennial and I ignore all unsolicited poll/politcal texts/calls assuming they are phishing scams or the like. I also forget to reply to non business related texts for days or sometimes weeks. Not proud of the latter but I’m guessing it’s not just me.
7486,"Gen X here too, and totally agree. Millennials don't show up either. On the other hand, Gen Z, and now Alpha too... man they will have to be reckoned with! I could not be more hopeful for our country"
7487,"
>There are people who still think Trump is the real president behind the scenes.

Like a ... Deep State?"
7488,"But yet we are in such a bad situation because of Biden, who is a shadow puppet for Obama. But Trump never lost, he is still the president…. 

Make it make sense"
7489,There are people who think Biden is dead and we’re watching a clone of him inside the White House. I actually know someone who believes this and a reporter on PBS pointed out a woman she interviewed this week who believes this too. Some people are just dumb and delusional.
7490,We really need to be an education forward country so we can make the moron class irrelevant again.
7491,"The activists I see on TikTok that go to MAGA rallies and interview these people, they say that they believe Trump is President. I don’t think I’ve ever seen any of them say “if he’s already President, he can’t run for a third term” and I really want to see the blank looks on their faces after that statement"
7492,"She started dating an (at least publicly) left-leaning football player. So that means he's secretly MAGA, too."
7493,"Not all of these people who were accusing Swift of being a Trumper were assuming it was ""their side"" she was on, especially in r/politics. 


100% of them are deeply stupid people though."
7494,Not to mention that they also think no one on the left works and we all need government handouts.
7495,"Ah, yes, classic move."
7496,Roll purgers starting to sweat.
7497,It's actually Walz's Grandpa's Brothers estranged family. I don't know any of my 2nd or 3rd cousins.
7498,And Kevin sorbo!
7499,As does this 54 year old dude.
7500,probably not florida though.  the stupid is too think there
7501,"I agree, I’m sure it was coordinated."
7502,lol shilling for a billionaire who doesn’t give a fuck about you
7503,"That’s not what I said. If people only vote/do research because a celebrity told them to, then they shouldn’t be voting. These are things an adult that is voting should already know."
7504,yeah I completely agree. its insanity to wote on a person just because you know them from tv and you heard they're a good business man/woman.
7505,"The first debate to be held on a couch. Tim picks a tasteful burgundy, with supple leather accents. Vance is visibly sweaty with a small protrusion from his pantaloons the entire debate. Tim offers him a donut. 

The aristocrats!"
7506,"In true Midwestern style, Walz’s dagger will be to ask Vance to help him pick out new upholstery"
7507,lol I read coach at first then reread hahaha
7508,"It will be pure entertainment, and you know Walz will use Trumps catch phrase against him."
7509,Needs to be the one from Fake Agent ahah
7510,He should present JD with donuts as a gift before the debate.
7511,can be bring a futon as a guest to the debate?
7512,That’s their only path to victory. Loudly declare victory over and over. Many Undecideds are people who don’t watch news basically. They only hear about politics through the frame of gossip
7513,Oh my god. I couldn't stop posting there! My fingers hurt!
7514,Yeah no one cares what their cult thinks
7515,"Vance pretty much puts his foot in his mouth by saying something incredibly offensive almost every time he goes out on a public event.  That's part of the problem and why he has record setting low approval ratings as a VP candidate. 

In the last 24 hours or so he has spread a fake story about immigrants eating pets, called the news cry babies for pointing out that this was a lie, encouraged people to keep spreading the lie, and then, despite being informed by the actual police of the city in question that it's not true, continued to insist that it might be. 

That's pretty much a microcosm of the JD Vance experience, except it's normally saying offensive shit about women.  The man is a walking 4chan post."
7516,Sherrod brown in ohio us also great it makes no sense they have him and vance at the same time.
7517,Picked by rich dickheads who spend the media money
7518,"As 14 cats In a trenchcoat, I support this message"
7519,As a human I support this message.
7520,Thank you ALF :)
7521,Wait a minute… are you sure you are from Texas and not Ohio ALF?
7522,"Yeah I desperately want a cat and/or a dog now I live alone, but just for the sake of the animal, I need to wait just a couple months more or until early 2025 to get used to my new job and stabilize my life a little bit!!"
7523,Yes of course
7524,"Yea, no doubt. But so is “vote blue no matter who” 

It’s dangerous when there are two idiots who get blind votes"
7525,"Debatable. No pun intended. 

Blind voting because your parents voted a way is no different than Taylor swift swaying your vote to a specific party. 

It’s uneducated, it’s dangerous and it’s irresponsible. Be it Kamala or Trump it’s a slippery slope. 

It’s great the masses are more involved in politics but not formulating a true opinion that is yours not only in politics is dangerous. Mimicking someone isn’t flattery, it’s idiocracy."
7526,"Hell, if she brings in enough voters for Kamala to win PA, it’s over."
7527,"The GOP will still be obstructive in the House and the Senate. They still have the 6-3 in the Supreme Court 

And that's not even mentioning State level elections.

Dems won't have the 60 votes to break the Filibuster and they're too cowardly to change the rules on Day 1 because ""Status Quo""

That's not me saying I want Trump or the GOP to win and hold the majority. I'm saying nothing is going to change.. 

But nothing is better than marching towards Fascism"
7528,She said that she's going to post on her stories so that'll be interesting 
7529,"I’m stoked too but I think this is a bit generous.

She’s solid at what she does, conventionally gorgeous, and has some people working with her who recognize timing, constraints, and opportunities better than most. All this in America, where folks worship the kind of beautiful she is."
7530,"I remember that when Trump won in 2016 someone (maybe she did) released a behind the scenes video where she is talking with a whole group of people on wether or not she should release an endorsement for Hillary.  She saw how vile he was back then and didn’t want him to be president, but the studio and all her management didn’t want her to alienate her Trump supporters.  That’s why I am curious if the team had a hand writing this because it feels like something a PR team has spent some time on."
7531,"Yeah, she's definitely been planning this. That was a perfectly written message. I think she deliberately waited until right after the debate."
7532,"Also nobody born during and after Clinton was in office answers the phone if it's an unknown number. And if they do, they hang up the moment they hear it's a survey."
7533,I said that to a MAGA supporter and the walked away from me lmaooo
7534,Ironically the heritage foundation and the federalists society are the republican's deep state.
7535,"https://youtu.be/4eJ0mUDu7pE

7536,I do wonder if he's going to come out with an official opinion or endorsement now.
7537,It's a slightly older phenomenon but it did happen with the trumpers claiming her
7538,Ted Nugent?!
7539,"Heh, don’t forget this 53 year old fella!"
7540,"Is it voting a certain way because of the celebrity or rather that she brought attention to the race?  Maybe some swifties aren't engaged in the process but having TS come out and talk about it will get them engaged.  She even tells fans do your own research and make your own choices, just go vote and here are the resources to register.

Sure, some may vote a certain way just because but the same happens for any candidate endorsement, I think the bigger impact really will just come from getting people out to vote period."
7541,"That's a work of pure fucking poetry.

I can almost hear my mind channeling Sagat's voice for the delivery."
7542,why did i read this with david attenboroughs voice?

7550,A very responsible choice. Some people just jump right into it with little to no thought or consideration for the pet.
7551,"I agree with the first statement - but the difference is that Kamala Harris is a competent candidate. Nobody should vote blind, and if you actually read their policies, watch their rallies, the debate... The choice between 2 is clear."
7552,"I would bet that most people are doing that.


It is similar to vote for somebody just because he said something you like to hear. Not really looking into the person you vote for.


If Swift would officially be a democrat politician it would suddenly make it fine again? Because she would be part of the party?


Not hearing too much outrage about Musk endorsing Trump."
7553,Oh you mean the state she’s from?
7554,"> If Harris Wins, it's just going to be another feckless Obama Administration. 

This is where I disagree, in the event that the turnout is big enough to give the Dems the house and senate, as well.

I think that they've finally learned their lesson that the GOP isn't playing fair or negotiating in good faith and, if they have both houses and the WH, they will finally push through a lot of reforms.

The top of that list will be reproductive rights and voting rights, followed very closely by SCOTUS reform via ethics requirements and possibly even term limits and expansion."
7555,It’s already up there.
7556,"Of course, it was only ever a projection. Every accusation is an admission."
7557,"Highly doubt it for a myriad of reasons—mid season, bad PR for him from a base that skews right, has not been politically active before, could very well be right leaning or an apolitical person."

7564,"Trump isn’t a home run but Kamala’s policies are not either. If you were a fan of Joe Bidens then it may be for you but it is very similar. She has some different takes on a few things but largely what is shown is strikingly similar/extension.

We have what, 330M Americans? And this is the best we can do? That’s the part that makes me sad as an American."
7565,Also idiotic.
7566,"Harry Reid vowed for Senate Reform in 2010 and 2012 after Mitch McConnell made it clear that they would block the Obama administration. 

A ""deal"" was struck in 2013 to keep the Filibuster, the Obama administration was still stalled  and then GOP picked up 8 seats in 2014

What I'm saying is, this bullshit has happened at least 2 times before. The Dems capitulate to the Right, the GOP promises to behave better, don't, and still hold shit hostage. 

Next cycle Dems have power: ""We're tired of stall tactics"" GOP says ""Okay, just a give us a few concessions and THIS TIME we'll be in our best behavior"" 


When Biden won in 2020 and we had the 50/50 and the VP, after seeing the bullshit they did in 2016 after Scalia's death, after Kavanaugh, after RBG's death, the first impeachment for withholding aid to Ukraine and 2 months of saying an election was stolen- the Dems still did nothing. 

""We can't be TOO EXTREME, the GOP super duper pinkie promise to not abuse it this time."" 

_____

The Dems would rather try to ""civilize"" fascists instead of actually taking steps to prevent their bullshit in the first place.

And yet, I'm still going to vote for them, because I have no goddamn choice"

7575,Swift's timing could not have been better.
7576,"I mean it was a matter of when rather than if, but the timing was pretty solid."
7577,"Their reaction shows how worried the GOP was about her endorsement. Worried enough for them to create the fake AI endorsement posters and images, and then enough for Trump to amplify and promote them. 

Make all their nightmares (and prison sentences) come true. 

As Project 2025 shows and Jan 6 showed, there are a lot of disgusting, unpatriotic, GOP traitors to the United States and to the US Constitution."

I love every minute"
7579,"But I was told by some people here that because she was a billionaire and because her boyfriend’s teammate’s wife liked a tweet by Trump, that she wouldn’t endorse because she’d turned Trump. You’re telling me that was an outrageous and conspiratorial thing to believe? /s"

7582,A person in a liberal dominant field who has endorsed other Dem candidates shockingly endorsed Kamala? No way…say it ain’t so!
7583,"Too bad she doesn’t seem able to get rid of her red cap boyfriend or bestie BH

Edit: so we can ignore his endorsement of mysogynist buttkisser and her affiliation with sexual harassment and liking Trump posts as long as Swift does the bare minimum?"
7584,Especially with early voting starting soon.
7585,I’ve got to disagree. She should have let Harris’ dominating debate performance simmer for a while. The endorsement should have come in a couple weeks as a momentum boost. Two big things happening at the same time is a waste.
7586,And 25% of them are [willing to admit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/10/quarter-republicans-think-trump-should-seize-power-even-if-he-loses/) they hate democracy.
7587,And already sold out.
7588,"Headline editors these days are forced to put on the dunce cap and sit in the corner in time-out if they fail to include a form of one of the following words in each headline:

 * Surprise
 * Shock
 * Alarm
 * Slams
 * Attack
 * Rage
 * Upheaval
 * Unrest
 * Fear


Headline editors are one of the worst parts of journalism these days."
7589,"Yeah but then conservatives learned the word ""psyop"" and started talking as if Swift was going to endorse Biden in 2024 (this was before he dropped out) as a ""psyop"" conspiracy election interference thing, and the response to that was mostly just ""why are you acting like it would be some sinister psyop, it's just a celebrity endorsement"" and some folks forgot she literally also endorsed Biden in 2020 (and Dems in 2018) making it such a weird thing for conservatives to fixate on"
7590,There were people in this sub as recently as this weekend who believed she wouldn’t endorse because Mahomes’s wife liked one of Trump’s tweets.
7591,"It's quite likely the exact timing was a surprise, although the fact that she would eventually endorse Harris was not a surprise."
7592,Kelce seems to be pretty liberal. He has endorsed many liberal causes and the right hates him because he did the Covid vax commercials. Now his buddy Mahomes and his wife are a different story.
7593,"""Swift endorses Harris after debate victory"" invites an important connection. It puts an exclamation point on the performance and plugs apolitical Swifties into the conversation while the memes are flying around social media about Trump's concept of a plan for post-birth aborted, pet-eating trans-immigrant prisoners."
7594,Need time to get people to register
7595,"I thought this at first as well.

But, this might be good timing to queue others thinking ""yeah, that's it for me, I've seen enough"". That might have been unplanned for her too, but I'd be skeptical.

Either way she makes a point about registering and people need to make those deadlines!"
7596,Momentum in general elections is a myth. The outcomes of debates are decided in the spin that comes after. A big celebrity endorsement immediately following a debate cements the impression of success. It was very well timed (don't doubt for a second that the timing was coordinated with the campaign)
7597,I don't think it distracted at all. I think the debate loss brought him to his knees and the follow-up endorsement kicked him to the curb. imh
7598,"Some States require voter registration 30 days before election day (October 6th).  At most, I'd say she could have waited a week before the endorsement.

If anything, this will draw Swifties attention to the debate footage that happened the same day, rather than whatever will be in the news next week."
7599,"Don't forget ""bombshell"" and ""breaks silence."""
7600,You forgot slammed
7601,"Mahomes supported BLM protests, so it's probably just his Texan wife."
7602,"He also defended buttkisser and his mysogynist rant at a graduation, and really just chases after black women so he puts on a good show."
7603,"Yeah, waiting, while I understand the idea to boost Harris later if people can’t register to vote it doesn’t do any good. "
7604,"They had Harris/Walz friendship bracelets for sale the same evening as the debate.  Either they anticipated she would eventually endorse them, and had the merch ready, or it was completely coordinated by everyone involved."
7605,This is the best argument I’ve heard for the timing.
7606,And BLASTED!!
7607,"Nah, it's in there. 4th item. Can't forget ""Slam!"""
7608,True.
7609,"I'm not a defender of Travis Kelce (as a Ravens fan, I can't say I'm a fan of him at all) but his defence of Butker was, at best, lukewarm:

>“I can’t say I agree with the majority of it or just about any of it outside of just him loving his family and his kids. And I don’t think that I should judge him by his views, especially his religious views, of how to go about life, that’s just not who I am,”

Basically, 'he said a load of horseshit but I don't want to call out a teammate.'"
7610,"I to have the feeling this was organized at some point.  Mainly because of the bracelets but also it was going to happen eventually.  Even though she has been more involved the last few cycles, it seems trump provoked her into it.   
I also thought it could take away from how bad Trump was by doing it the same night but it seems it just kicked him while he was down.  In two weeks it would have made her the main story and I’m not sure she would have liked that."
7611,"""Furious,"" ""blindsided,"" and ""uproar."""
7612,"Jesus, I should get some sleep. 

I'm letting my stupid comment stand. Cheers"
7613,Hot take but maybe we can judge people by their views when it’s “women belong in the kitchen and are baby incubators only”
7614,"I can, and happily will. Kelce doesn't seem to want to, at least when it's a guy he has to work with. But I don't believe what he said amounts to a defence, as you categorised it."
7615,“He doesn’t seem to want to” but also “I don’t believe what he said amounts to a defense” so either way Kelce is a redcap POS who doesn’t deny maga beliefs. Glad we’re on the same page

7617,I wonder if Trump accepting a fake endorsement from Swift really pissed her off? He'd be wise to stop fucking around like that but no one has ever accused Trump of being wise.

7621,"Opportunistic timing....

Smh

But hey, any support is good"
7622,She said the AI manipulation Trump used disturbed her and conjured up the dangers of spreading misinformation.
7623,I wonder if he slapped JD afterwards because of all the dumb shit he has to hear because of him. Now he will have to deal with repeating that dumb ass lie about immigrants for awhile. Just imagine JD is probably like “Why would you repeat that dumb shit!!!!!”
7624,I would say well thought out timing.  Timing is either well played or mistaken.
7625,For her. It inserts her on what otherwise would be a Kamala news cycle. Kind like when RFK dropped after DNC
7626,Swift doesn't need opportunistic timing..  She is doing just fine picking her timing pretty much on everything these days.
7627,not needing it oesn't mean she won't take advntage of it

7629,">“The VP cheated with earring headphones? Not surprising,” **former NFL player Antonio Brown**

Well there's a reliable source if I ever saw one."
7630,Right wing doing more coping after another loss. Let them complain. We have more serious work to do. Volunteer and get everyone you know out to vote this November.
7631,"Even their conspiracy theories are old and played.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/clinton-secret-earpiece-debate/"
7632,"This is hilarious.

The right is **so** dumb, that they cannot fathom anyone being as smart or as prepared as Harris was. So in order for someone to do that well they must have cheated."
7633,"So high tech, they made Trump literally insane."
7634,Trump should get his ears pierced
7635,"Every. Single. Time.

The copium is too real."
7636,"What a bunch of losers. It’s never their fault. They are always cheated. Grow up, accept responsibility for your own failures and grow from them."
7637,One thing that has been shocking to find out over the last 10 years or so is how many people just make stuff up to justify their opinions. Truth doesn’t matter to them. Please vote. Don’t accept that he is going to lose. Vote like your life depends upon it.
7638,"They do know that in order for earrings to be earpieces, they need to be IN the ear, right? Otherwise it’s just a speaker hanging off your ear lobe…putting out noise…and able to be picked up by the no doubt too of line microphones used in these debates?"
7639,You know you've lost badly when you're inventing James Bond-esque conspiracies for why your opponent did so well.
7640,It’s unfair and undemocratic how she used them to create AI images of Trump ranting about immigrants eating cats and shit instead of allowing viewers to see the erudite dissertation the man delivered on the specifics of his domestic policy agenda.
7641,"Good thing they didn't find her Shoe Phone.  I do think for the next debate we need a ""Cone of Silence"" ^TM"
7642,Don’t make me tap the sign: “Weird”
7643,"Given the MAGA Rule of Projection, this means Trump himself was wearing an earpiece and probably ignored it out of hubris."
7644,"Pump out a few stupid lies like this, which will get your base through a few difficult days of reality-based debate coverage, and then they'll forget all about how badly Kamala spanked their messiah.

After that, there will be another news cycle and they can forget all about it."
7645,"This is so stupid.

Don't they know that all black people communicate via [the shining](https://youtu.be/CTuts6Ns_SU?si=wai_aStXAxGRnex8) and Obama simply fed her all the answers!!"
7646,"This doesn't even make sense as a cheating device.

It's not like an exam with right answers. Candidates have to listen to the information, process it, and respond in realtime.

There's no world in which it would be more effective to have someone else sitting on the other end doing it and feeding answers back to the candidate, while the candidate listened and spoke nearly simultaneously."
7647,"Ok, so did her earrings make Trump say all that insane stuff he said?"
7648,Which totally explains the constant stream of bullshit out of his mouth.
7649,Maybe we should look into whether some nefarious individual was whispering lines like ‘immigrants are eating your pets’ into Trump’s earpiece. That’s where the debate was lost.
7650,"Which answers do they believe she needed outside assistance with? 'Cause I don't remember any responses that didn't sound like they could have come from a competent, well-prepared individual off the top of their head."
7651,"Occam's razor folks: ""if you have two competing ideas to explain the same phenomenon, you should prefer the simpler one."" 

The simpler one in this case is that Trump's poor performance was because of Trump himself. Harris' earrings didn't make Trump talk about immigrants eating pets, dodge if he wanted Ukraine to win the war or not, whine about his rally attendance, etc. Harris didn't need to cheat, she just needed Trump to talk."
7652,"Honest to god, fuck these people"
7653,"The losing team always blames the refs or cheating.

Signed,
A long time Patriot fan"
7654,This reminds me of when Bush was accused of “concealing” a giant communications device during the debate as a hunch on his shoulders
7655,"She's worn those earrings before, many times. Tiffany I believe."
7656,They’re huffing the hard copium
7657,"Meh. Try harder, clowns. This shit is so stale."
7658,"The moderators, Kamala earrings - these weird excuses don't have anything to do with the nonsensical answers Trump gave. These things didn't make Trump fail to prepare for the debate, which is the main reason why he sucked. Concept of a plan that he will eventually think of after election isn't a great debate strategy."
7659,"Even if you took this absurd argument in good faith, how does Kamela wearing cheating earrings explain the bat shit things Trump said?"
7660,I don't think an earpiece would actually help someone during a timed debate. This is just more deflection and possibly projection. Perhaps Kamala should ask for drug testing at the next debate.
7661,"They should be careful.  On the off chance there's a second debate, the first that PopPop - undecided voter from Wisconsin - will hear about this is when the crazy man suddenly starts yelling about Harris talking to people in her earrings."
7662,I heard that Trump was wearing an anal transponder controlled by Victor Orban.
7663,"Anything to keep from admitting she’s an intelligent, strong, and eloquent woman. "
7664,"If you look in the Conservative subs, they even have a brand name already."
7665,"They have pearls and gold. There are no regular earrings, anywhere, combining these two exact materials.

You would have thought Nova would consider that, and design their secret spy earrings to be less easily identified. Dummies."
7666,Not even a 10 year old would come up with such a dumb theory 🤦 I think y IQ dropped reading the title.
7667,"So stupid it hurts.  
  
  
If she wanted to cheat and not be caught, why would she wear it on her left ear for the world to see?"
7668,Please can they just own it that someone screwed the pooch big time.
7669,"It’s such a stupid conspiracy. It doesn’t take having a microphone in your ear to answer the questions. 

You just have to have an actual plan and answer to the problems presented. Which trump does/did not"
7670,"They are reaching so ***hard right*** now.

Everything that doesn't fall into the uniform perspective they were raised to believe is fake, gay, a grand conspiracy etc."
7671,Did the earrings force the orange blob to speak gibberish for the entire debate?
7672,"ugggh.

or ya know....maybe....just maaaaybe, she's a decent debater."
7673,"Sigh, they are just so dumb and boring."
7674,The maga cope is reaching critical mass.
7675,Were they magic earrings that made Trump display how total insanity?
7676,They were a sonic weapon that emitted high pitch sounds which caused Trump to fold like a flour tortilla.
7677,"It was trumps incoherent rambling and inability to temper his narcissistic impulses that lost him the debate, did her earrings do that? Do they magically make him behave like *checks notes, exactly how he’s been behaving for the last eight years?"
7678,"What did her earrings do, send a signal to force Trump to yell ""babies get executed"" and ""immigrants eat cats and dogs?"""
7679,The fact they can't comprehend studying before a debate is wild. Lol
7680,"She forced Don Old to screw up.
Whaaa!"
7681,Trump never loses if everyone always cheats.
7682,As was Donald's diaper
7683,"Remember when dubya glitched out in 2004 debate when his earpiece went down? Yeah, earpieces have been small enough to hide inside an ear for 20 plus years. Why have one in an earring? Derp logic."
7684,Coping mechanisms needed
7685,"Trump could've wore earrings too, in his glorious right ear... Or GOPs ""would approve this message""?"
7686,It’s always some dumb conspiracy with these people. As if all the questions asked weren’t very obvious questions debate moderators would ask and thus very easy to prep for.
7687,"Always cheat, always win in a fight. I’m sure she heard the the ear
Ear piece: you got this one?
Harris: yes I think I can handle Haitians eating pets. 
Ear piece: he just said concept of a plan. 
Harris: the internet will handle that one
Ear piece: Guns?
Harris: yes I own several"
7688,Let’s say she did have these high tech pieces.  Does it really matter? Like don’t presidents have advisors and work through issues with others supporting them?
7689,Why aren’t they infuriated by Trump’s ear prophetic/noise cancelling earbud?
7690,They were bluetooth ear buds and she's a cheater. And if they weren't they were way too expensive and proves she's out of touch with the average voter. And if they weren't then they were not stylish and proves she's  indian and not black! Checkmate mamallama harris!
7691,So countless athletes will cheat to win a game but it's crazy to think a politician will cheat to win an election? I would be shocked if there were any politicians in high office that didn't cheat.  They all cheat.
7692,"This is silly. Trump simply made weak points, repeating over and over the same thing as he somehow traces  everything back to the border issue. Then he talks about pets, then he says “a concept of a plan”. He kept getting baited, dug himself in a hole and struggled getting out. 

It was clear. She rehearsed for months for this debate. The acting was too obvious at the beginning but she got better and better as the debate went on. I think there were things that gave her more control and confidence, like having the debate on ABC, no audience, him not making eye contact with her, fact checking trump more often. 

Now let’s talk about Harris. Overall, she was the clear winner in this debate but that’s not her natural character. Lt’s remember her before this debate. You can see with almost all of her interviews/talks, she fumbles and cannot clearly respond to tough questions. She’s a terrible public speaker. She’s notorious for giving us a hideous word salads. She role switches depending on the audience. Behind all this facade, it’s hard to tell who she is, what she stands for, and who is/isn’t on her side. Her stance on international politics is very weak. Clearly, she will blindly follow foreign leaders even if it means putting the Americans people thru WW3. 

So, I think as far as the debate, she killed it by painting Trump as a chaotic and weak person, but it doesn’t mean she’s fit for a president. Her everyday performance (which matters more) vs the debate performance are miles apart, which I’m sure leaves a lot of people feeling insecure about her leadership as a president. 

This is not to say trump is the better candidate, I don’t think that’s the case. But Trump on this matter is more natural with his debates as he always acts and behaves in a consistent manner. Harris just isn’t consistent and her leadership is questionable in these tough times."
7693,"If you believe that Black people are fundamentally capable of intelligence and empathy, her performance has to be explained somehow.  There has to be a white person somewhere who gave her those words to say."
7694,Well … NO DOY!
7695,"Kamala cheating doesn’t mean Trump didn’t sound like garbage. Also, I very much doubt she cheated."
7696,That dude hasn't been right in the head since that Wild Card game where he got his bell rung by Vontaze Burfict.
7697,Mr. Batshit Conspiracy
7698,The CTE be CTEing
7699,">“The VP cheated with earring headphones? Not surprising,” **says man who has been repeatedly hit in the head.**"
7700,Mr. Big Conspiracy
7701,But I need to know what Ja thinks.
7702,Mr. Took-my-uniform-off-and-quit-on-my-team?
7703,Anyone who knows anything about AB would know to basically not give any stock to anything he says.
7704,"I don’t think you listened to the debate carefully. Your boss was blatantly lying and trump smashed her well. Now she is caught cheating. Well you know what, if she get elected, come back to this comment 4 years later. Peace out!"
7705,"Its the same reason they call Michelle Obama a man.  They cant fathom that a black woman is so intelligent, articulate, and respected.  So she must not be a black woman!  They can't plausibly argue (not that that has stopped them before) she isnt black ..so they go for the woman part."
7706,Havana syndrome earings
7707,That was his debate help butt plug. Turns out you have to know Morse Code to understand morse code though.
7708,"His ears can't be pierced, look at the miraculous healing after his ear was shot in the assassination attempt."
7709,"Many people, including veterans with big tears in their eyes are saying Trump was using a vibrating butt plug to know when to have a concept of a debate plan."
7710,I’ll upvote this
7711,"One thing that's been surprising to me is how many people are surprised by how many people just make stuff up to justify their opinions.

They taught me that in school.

They were like ""and then the Catholic church (the same one that Sean over there belongs to today) just straight up killed a guy for saying the sun was bigger than the earth. We know it happened because they were proud of it and they paid his distant cousin to paint it happening.""

And now everyone is like ""man, people sure were dumb back then. It's a good thing the present happened and got rid of all the idiots.""

There wasn't a magic smart wave. We're the same species that did all that evil dumb shit."
7712,"No, logic doesn't work on these people."
7713,"I think to actually believe this conspiracy one has to have a below average understanding of how things work. Also, a victim complex. "
7714,It's too bad we don't have mythbusters anymore. They should bring that show back given all the conspiracy theories out there.
7715,It did look pretty much like a large USB power bank does today. Probably a weird coincidence of light and fabric drape. But we'll never know...
7716,"I dont get why they needed to have the microphones  at all - all of the tv feeds would have had the live audio as part  of it?  Even if you didnt go that route, you can  bring your own lapel - type mic, and hide it somewhere on your person - a sleeve, in your hair,  etc.  Thats one of the worst things about conspiracy theories - Lack of imagination."
7717,"""Kamala Harris did well at the debate last night. Here's why that's bad for Kamala Harris""

🙄"
7718,This is laughable. This is all the same old tired talking points from Trumpers. Literally stale at this point. You wrote a novel about nothing original.
7719,Concussions can completely change someone. It is for sure why some nfl players are such awful people.
7720,Sounds like he’s moved off of Catlin Clark and her hair styles
7721,I'm so glad people in r/politics know about this!

7728,Evolution takes millions of years.
7729,Yeah. Sigh …
7730,"But this is unfalsifiable  - The thing they are describing could/would be MUCH smaller and than the earrings, and is totally a thing that exists.  But in that case, anyone could have been wearing one.  It would be funny to ask ""Well how do we know TRUMP wasn't wearing one also?""

7734,"I expected her to hand Orange Weirdo his ass but she didn't have to, he did it to himself and she just stood there flabbergasted (as most of us did) at the diarrhea that he gurgled out.

He looked pathetic, tired and weak. Harris looked like a president."
7735,100%. She is more than qualified. 🌊
7736,"Donald Trump was obliterated.

The debate last night showed that Donald Trump should never again be the president of America.

To all Taylor Swift fans, AKA childless cat ladies,  it is a mortal sin not to vote for Harris."
7737,I know I can.
7738,My main takeaway from the debate was that this woman will be the next president and do a fine job. It removed any doubt.
7739,I can’t wait for Putin and Xi to get their turns.
7740,"She seemed a bit nervous at first. Big debate on national TV and all so it makes sense

But once she found her stride and starting pushing trumps buttons it was fucking over"
7741,"Hey. 

We know. 

And we are legion.

Wonder how that will play out on the world stage"

Just to think the women in the states who lost the ability to choose, if there parents voted for trump, they gave him power to do it"
7744,"She was brilliant. She manipulated him into acting like a fool and pointed out that that’s exactly what real strongmen do, and that’s exactly what they’ll continue to do to him. It means affirmatively that she can’t fall for this nonsense or be cowed herself. It’s easy to intimidate these dictators, Hilary Clinton did it all the time for maximum effect and Kamala shows every sign that she won’t be bullied. She’s also spent years learning from the US’s top foreign policy expert, Joe Biden, and it shows clearly."
7745,"I think it would pay to look at her history for your answers - she was my DA in San Francisco so I’ve had a front seat for the last several decades. That strategy you picked up on is one of a million in her bag of tricks, she was dealing with a neutered opponent- the guy is clearly rather stupid and he’s senile - so she didn’t need much strategy.

When facing an actual tough opponent she really turns the screws, it’s what she’s done for a very long time and done with wild success. The world stage will be fun for her."

7747,But it was rigged!! 3 VS 1!! /s Aren't Trump supporters tired of his incessant crying?
7748,Where are the calls for Trump to step aside after that debate performance?
7749,"I'm generally against elder abuse, but despite myself, I have to make an exception for what I witnessed last night."
7750,"Yes, it will give her a 3 4 5 point bump

Swifties and Trump's/MAGAs' inevitable sexist insults toward here will give another 1 2 point bump

That he and his base and MAGA pundit bozos thought he won is irrelevant

There is no way in this universe that the majority of undecideds who watched that debate would come away saying yeah, Trump is great, what a performance, he's presidential, he knows his stuff, he can fix things, I'm voting for him.

  
MSM will try to find ways to diminish her performance - was her face TOO expressive, why didn't she attack him MORE, she was nasty when she called him (x) or claimed he said (y), why didn't she talk more about HER policies, she gave an incomplete answer to question X, she failed to hit him on (x), and other absolute bullshit nonsense"
7751,"His follows will still vote for him we can’t get comfortable, go out and vote blue 2024! Because we know sure as shit his cult will be going out and voting red"
7752,What’s most interesting is how people are missing the larger idea of her manipulating him so easily and how foreign adversaries can and have manipulated him for years.  That was a prosecutor playing with a defendant getting them to convict themselves.
7753,"For the next debate, I would be willing to pay for a live feed of their advisors’ green room."
7754,Yes but go vote.
7755,"No. The media will continue to sane-wash Trump and spin objectively good things for Harris as bad. 

Because billionaires own the media, and all billionaires are fascists. If they weren’t, they’d never have become billionaires. There is no honest path to having that much money."
7756,"Probably won’t change anything, unfortunately."
7757,There are no undecideds at this point.  I just hope this debate is enough to motivate those eligible to vote to get out vote.  Make a plan.  Do it early.  Vote.
7758,"Until Trump loses and hopefully goes to prison, most if not all  of his supporters will continue to kiss his ass. It has always been the lesser of two evils for President. This time,I still don’t understand the undecided but, I for one actually want someone who is competent and not a total fool. For once people,
Vote Blue for all our best interest."
7759,"""Have you ever walked your enemy down, like with a poker face..?"""
7760,"Maybe it’s because they think of Trump as “normal,” like them…or how they would be, “if only the Dems and libs stopped ruining the US!”

Maybe they can’t imagine anyone performing like Harris without cheating. It’s insane, she did amazing and deserves praise for her prep and execution. I even caught one or two moments where she lost herself and either picked back up where she left off or switch “track,” so to speak, and kept going like nothing happened. 

Of course, some of his supporters are plain sexist/racist, and still think skin color and gender accurately measure one’s intellect and capacity for success 🙄"
7761,"Honestly if it doesn't move the needle then to me one of two things is true:

1. Voters just don't want to vote for a woman.
2. Polling is just grossly under representing her support.

Sure, disagreements on policy are a possibility but come on let's be realistic. Harris is running as a mainstream  centrist Democrat. None of her policies are that out of left field (pun intended). She has released her platform already. If I hear from so called undecided voters ""I need to know more about her"" after this, I just assume that's code for ""idk if I can vote for a woman""."
7762,"Maybe if you complain about bombing a 3v1 debate, you shouldn’t be given the most powerful job in the world…"
7763,"Yeah, 3 against one. Harris, reality, and decorum were all against Trump."
7764,No cause all they care about in life is grievance. Think about the washed out people you knew from high school and put them in a big group. Your life is not bad cause of politicians your life is bad cause of your choices
7765,"He spoke legitimate sentences, it was a 3v1 debate and not to mention clearly doesn't have dementia."
7766,"Many focus groups showed that their undecided participants moved her way by a large margin. I think CNN had it 5 definitely Harris, 10 probably Harris, 3 undecided, and 6 probably Trump after the debate. That is a 63.5-25 split for Harris."
7767,"This right here!

The stoooooooooopid issue of Haitian immigrants eating pets demonstrated how flawed Trump's method of ascertaining reality is.  Given all the resources his money could secure and, when he was President, all the tools of one of the greatest intelligence gathering apparatus in the world... this idiot gets his facts from watching TV.

This is not what the nation should want in a President.

But it is oh so much worse when you see that it's not only how easily he is misled, distracted and misinformed but that he is a complete sucker for anyone diligent enough to manipulate them for whatever purpose.

About the only saving grace here is that Trump is simply too chaotic to stay on anyone's leash for too long, especially since every next guy can just as easily manipulate him.

Nonetheless, this is not someone who will serve the interests of the nation or her people."
7768,Those billionaires are going to have to spend every penny of their billions to sane-wash Trump’s performance. He said immigrants were eating cats and dogs for food because he “saw it on tv”. People are NOT going to stop talking about that
7769,"3v1 why? Because they pointed out that people aren’t eating cats or getting post birth abortions? 

Talk shit get hit. If he didn’t lie they wouldn’t have to pull him up on it. "
7770,"The bar is through the floor for Trump. Also when all you do is lie, expect moderators to moderate…"
7771,“3v1” lmao
7772,Sentences? Barely. Legitimate? Far from it. Please do something Trump would never do and admit he lost. You and everyone saying otherwise is just embarrassing yourselves.
7773,"Trump spoke for over 10 minutes MORE than Kamala and most of it was incoherent bullshit. He failed fucking hard, and it was glorious. He has no one to blame except himself."
7774,Cope more???
7775,"Not letting someone blatantly lie about post-birth abortions that don't happen is not exactly 3v1. 

Maybe once you've pulled your head out of your own ass, you'll start to see that your guy is a liar and an idiot. Neither of which are fit to be president."
7776,"It wasn't 3v1. It only seemed that way because Trump was the only one saying things about immigrants eating people's pets, billions of people crossing the border, post birth abortions, etc. The fact that they helpfully unmuted his mic every time he opened his mouth and left it on for him to regurgitate his incomprehensible word salad, whether it was his turn to speak or not, is proof they were not ganging up on him. And if he actually believes the ridiculous lies that poured out of his mouth, then his brain is as good as cat food."
7777,MAGATS working overtime right now lul
7778,I dare you to try and explain how ranting about how “giving transgender surgeries to illegal aliens in prison” is grounded in reality.
7779,"He had concepts of legitimate sentences. Such as ""They're eating dogs!!"""
7780,This is sarcasm right? You're not really this stupid?
7781,"He was rambling on about immigrants getting sex change surgeries in prison and pets being eaten, but okay."
7782,The debate wasn't a counterstrike match my guy...
7783,bros winning gold with these mental gymnastics
7784,"Homie he’s fucking yelling about people eating dogs in a presidential debate. He’s demented. If anyone else said that shit, it’s career suicide. Palin sunk McCain with less."
7785,"Sentences? Sure, I’ll give you that. Legitimate? Come on now…."
7786,It's not clear to me
7787,"> clearly doesn’t have dementia

He said that immigrants are eating cats and dogs for food because he “saw it on tv”"
7788,"This is satire, right? You can't honestly believe that he spoke sentences that answered questions, or even remained on the topic being discussed. Copium and blindness are powerful things."
7789,Hey look everybody! Another Russian asset identified!
7790,Do you believe that ‘After-birth abortions’ are a thing? Yes or no.
7791,"lol, you obviously aren’t familiar with the symptoms of dementia."
7792,Y’all are so pathetically brainwashed
7793,All GOP can do this morning is cite online interactive polls which are hilariously meaningless.
7794,They’ll just take out sweetheart loans against their stocks. It won’t actually cost them anything.
7795,Haha I just posted almost the same response.
7796,"And that's a good thing, because the more he speaks the further he sinks."
7797,They just reported it was 5 minutes. Everything else you wrote checks out.
7798,"Funny you say I'm a MAGA because I think the republican candidate is better than the democratic one. I'm a conservative at most. I have so many viewpoints that are liberal, but many that are conservative and they override my liberal viewpoints. For example I want more for conservation in wildlife and habitat (liberal view because most republicans dont care to keep land for wildlife and habitat conservation), but I also think Americans should have the opportunity to recreate (hunt and fish specifically) on these lands (republican, because hunting is a core value and tradition, which Republicans care more for.) 

What overrides it is that I sure do love my 1st and 2nd amendment, lmao."
7799,"Well, legitimate as in they make sense, and he accurately says what he is thinking. Maybe not always...accurate😬"
7800,"What wasn't clear? All the sentences he spoke, he spoke with little to no stuttering, made his points and made them with confidence. No evidence of dementia in his behavior."
7801,"He said he saw on TV people or a person was saying an illegal immigrant took their pets for food. Not sure the accuracy of the statement, but what does this have to do with dementia? You can be wrong and so be mentally there, unlike our current president."
7802,"He speaks clearer than my grandpa who doesn't have dementia. 

I've seen people with dementia because my mom used to be a care giver. Trump is not that🤦‍♂️"
7803,I ain't no commie😂 very funny though. Even putin endorsed Kamala (maybe that's because he wants the US to keep a weak leader????)
7804,"That's straight up murder wtf? After birth abortions, so killing a new born baby??"
7805,"Everyone is saying stuff like this, but no one is saying what signs of it he's showing?"
7806,"You want to talk about being brainwashed??? You're voting for kamala harris for no other reason other than she's not Trump, she's black and Indian, and a woman. 

She has no clear plan, she states her ""goals"" but can't say how she's going to accomplish them?? You want to hire someone to a job and have them show their credentials after??"
7807,"*They took, when they took over, they got rid of it, started getting rid of it, and the prices were going up the roof. They immediately let these guys go to where they were. I would have been five times, four times, five times higher because you're talking about 3 1/2 years ago. They got it up to where I was because they had no choice. Because the prices of energy were quadrupling and doubling. You saw what happened to gasoline. So, they said let's go back to Trump. But if she won the election, the day after that election, they'll go back to destroying our country and oil will be dead, fossil fuel will be dead.*"
7808,"So he's not demented.  He's just stupid, impulsive, narcissistic, and a bully.  Good to know."
7809,"Yes, it’s murder i.e a crime. 

So, understanding that this mainstream republican talking point is a lie, why shouldn’t the debate moderators call out Trump for it?"
7810,"The word salad, confusion about reality,forgetting what he’s saying mid sentence, slurring words, choosing incorrect words, confabulation, poor emotional control…"
7811,"She's a former state DA, a former U. S. Senator, and current Vice President.

Are you talking about a set of economic policies?

It hasn't even been two months since she became the candidate. I hope she's taking more time than that to formulate a plan."
7812,"Sorry, I misspoke. To be brainwashed, you’d have to have a brain to begin with, and that’s clearly not the case."
7813,"I read it fine😅 I'm not trying to be ignorant, but I read it perfectly fine. Maybe I have dementia at the age of 18?😂"
7814,"I don't recall him forgetting what he's saying mid sentence at any point? When did he slur words? Poor emotional control doesn't mean anything for dementia, unfortunately. Most people have poor emotional control to most standards."
7815,"She's given few to no policies that she plans on making for her presidency. Argues that trump will be the end of democracy when she openly said in 2020 that she would make an executive order that directly broke the 2nd amendment (an executive order for I believe mandatory buy backs of ""assault styled weapons"" or something similar) where Biden even told her to stay constitutional. When the 2nd amendment is what is keeping the US a democracy, that worries me. 

She gives ideas but hasn't given a plan that I'm aware of. She ""talks to the American people"" but proceeds to avoid questions like how she will fix the economy by saying, ""I grew up in a low income household,"" or something else of the like. I'm not saying trump doesn't avoid questions, but Kamala does it so much worse, in my opinion."
7816,"If that's all you can say to me, then I guess I'm doing alright because insults aren't even an argument 😂"
7817,"You haven’t been paying attention to his speeches, he does those things all the time. Most people have better emotional control than Donald Trump does."
7818,"I watch a lot of his speeches, or at least a good chunk of most of them. I just haven't noticed anything that screams dementia or physical weakness like our current president. He talks a little funny and exaggerates just about everything, but he speaks clearly."
7819,"lol, then you definitely aren’t paying attention."

7821,">All you have to do is check the sound levels on Trump’s microphone from the start of the debate to its end to see that Harris came out ahead. A debate that began with a question that should favor Trump — are Americans better off economically than they were four years ago — quickly turned against the former president. Even when the debate returned to the friendly terrain of immigration, Harris set a trap for Trump that had him talking about the size of crowds at his campaign rallies and fever-swamp tales of abducted pets in short order — and at an increasing volume that made it clear he knew things were not going his way.

Trump is so easy to manipulate, it's pathetic.   

My take-aways:

* It has to be true, I saw it on TV!

* I have a concept of  a plan!

* I had nothing to do with January 6th!  They told me to give a speech, and I did!"
7822,You know it wasn’t close when the conservative subreddits are convincing themselves that she was given the questions ahead of time and/or was fed all of her answers through an earpiece because they didn’t know it was possible for someone to answer a question that coherently without cheating
7823,"You know it's bad for Trump when even the trolls on here don't know what to say about it.

Best they have is anger that he got fact checked on post-birth abortions and migrants eating dogs and Kamala didn't (despite the moderators allowing Trump's constant interruptions). Yeah, that's because they only fact checked truly batshit insane lies, and only one person on that stage is a truly batshit insane liar."
7824,"
It's so embarrassing to watch conservatives dig into their position and humiliate themselves defending Trump. Like just let it go. He's not going to win. Jettison him from your life. Take the next 4 years to get behind someone who isn't such a creepy weird stupid fuck"
7825,"Hi there, fellow Dutchie, I've only seen about 30 minutes of this debate and I'm already tired of all the bullshit that flows out of his mouth. Yes, we are laughing at America, but not because of the reasons Donny Dumb Dumb thinks we are. 


HOW is this such a close race?



Edit: Just reached the part where he says Orban is respected. Just to be clear for the people not in Europe... Nobody sane over here respects Orban. We all just want to see him disappear forever."
7826,Trump was so scared he couldn't even look at Kamala the entire debate
7827,It it was a shut out! The humiliating defeat of a tired old fool?
7828,"As happy as I am right now, and as confident as I am she'll destroy him in the election, we must remember to VOTE!

Biden won the popular vote in 2020 by over 7 million votes... but Trump could've easily won the electoral college.

Like Zak and Wheezie, Democrats, Independents, and SANE Republicans must get out and VOTE!

Now look, you may think i'm a bit obsessed with Dragon Tales. Thing is, I want to use my love for Dragon Tales to rock the vote, and get nostalgic people amped up for Kamala.

Let's look at Cassie, the pink blonde dragon. She's kind, shy, considerate, and smart. Trump is none of those things. She is also a big fan of nature, fond of reading and always tries to be the voice of reason and tries to encourage others. Trump hates nature, tries to rile up people to attack others and commit terrorist attacks and insurrections and shit, and i'm 99% certain he really sucks at reading and hates books.

Oh, and Cassie is very kind and accepting of the Hispanic characters (Emmy, Max, Quetzal, etc). Whereas Trump wants to build a wall around Mexico and make them pay for it.

That's just ONE example. You can compare Ord, or Zak and Wheezie, or Emmy, or Max, or Quetzal, or anyone else from the show, and all will be much kinder than Trump.

Cassie always wants to do the right thing. That's what I get at. I mean, if Cassie herself were standing next to you and seeing Kamala vs Trump, do you think she'd tell you not to vote at all? No. She'd tell you Trump is insane and would be a terrible president, and remind you of what he tried to do, and tell you to vote for Kamala. Cassie has trouble speaking up, but her badge would glow brighter than ever by speaking up against Trump.

Do what Cassie would and vote for Kamala Harris on November 5, 2024. And make sure to check your registration status too."
7829,"By my count, Trump is now 1-6 in Presidential debates. No wonder Harris' team was so eager right after the debate for a 2nd one"
7830,Will it matter?
7831,The “experts” in the article all say Kamala won the debate
7832,"All she had to do was speak clearly, she nailed it"
7833,"I was incredibly annoyed when Trump kept double backing to his rambles about the Nordstream pipeline when the topic moved on already. And the illegal immigrants and non citizen votes?

The hyperbolics and exaggerations don't stop ever with Trump and I think that Republicans just lack the ability to think critically if they're so riled up to stand by his rhetoric.

I'm wondering if he's just learned to parrot the most popular views among his voter base and had no plans for actually having a debate, only running his mouth."
7834,"Don’t go to /conservative then. They and Fox News claim he absolutely killed her! And he was treated unfairly because he was fact checked. 

It’s absolute delusional."
7835,trump has jumped the shark.
7836,"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/11/harris-biden-debate-winner-takeaways-00178442) reduced by 89%. (I'm a bot)
*****
> Wren: Given how tonight went, I would be surprised if there&#039;s another debate - even though the Harris campaign said afterward she is &quot;Ready for a second debate. Is Donald Trump?&quot; Trump might want a mulligan, but it&#039;s difficult to see how his advisers would want to go through something like that again.

> Trump&#039;s team, I&#039;m sure, will regret that the former president didn&#039;t more forcefully link Harris to Biden in the first 30 minutes of the debate.

> One of Trump&#039;s advantages in this race had been that voters didn&#039;t see him as a riskier choice than Biden or Harris: Biden because of his age, and Harris because she was unproven.

7841,Good leaders do as they’re told.
7842,“I got involved in the Taliban” was a definite highlight for me.
7843,"The narrative on the right has been that Harris is stupid/inarticulate, what you are seeing is post facto rationalization as a resolution to the cognitive dissonance of actually seeing their beliefs falsified on live television."
7844,"well it’s stupid they both should already have answers to the questions it’s not like they’re new unexpected topics but of course he was
unprepared he didn’t prepare"
7845,Any person that pays a little attention to news and has half a brain could have guessed what they were going to discuss.
7846,"There was the point where she backed up to address a point from earlier in the middle of an answer, THEN RETURNED to the main point and finished her thought. Trump deviated a number of times and never returned to the question asked."
7847,"That’s called preparedness.

But I understand the confusion coming from someone who thinks remembering “person woman man camera tv” would be a sign of genius."
7848,I'm starting to think he didn't look at her as a way of keeping himself from mouthing something he shouldn't.

7860,"The ""turning frogs gay"" thing was partially true though. There was a chemical causing a fish that is a hermaphrodite to all change male in a spill. Sorta true.."
7861,"That was disgusting. Multiple officers died and were seriously injured. 

‘The rouge cop who shot Babbit’. She was trying to jump through a door that the police were blocking and warned her multiple times not to enter.  Trump caused her death because of his lies about the election."
7862,"Which is nonsensical, she can't call out the national guard or army or anything else.   A lot of Trump delusions on stage tonight for sure."
7863,"Meanwhile he continues to hammer this idea that a president can just do whatever they want.

But apparently Pelosi > president"
7864,You don't become the DA being a moron. These Trumpers were in denial.
7865,"Must be true, I saw it on TV! Must be false, I saw it on TV!"
7866,"That’s ironic. Trump is genuinely one of the most inarticulate individuals I’ve ever witnessed. His mind isn’t sharp or refined. He will meander from one topic to the next and back again. Nothing he says is clear or concise. He speaks in vague generalities. I do not understand how he captures people’s attention. If he spoke like at a typical house party, people would dismiss him immediately as being crazy. He is very unappealing and unimpressive."
7867,"That's a fair point, lol. 

""Debate moderators shock Trump and Biden with surprise questions about immigration, abortion, the economy and foreign policy!!""

Kamala Harris apparently in shambles, telling staff she was only expecting questions about the Golden Bachelor."
7868,100% unhinged

7875,">The ""turning frogs gay"" thing was partially true though. There was a chemical causing a fish that is a hermaphrodite to all change male in a spill. Sorta true..

It is not even ""sorta true"" because frogs and fishes are not in the same species.  Also, hermaphrodite and intersex is not the same thing as Gay."
7876,No. No it’s not
7877,"Turning something male does not equal turning something gay. I mean, it's very easy for any clear thinking adult to figure out."
7878,Those odds aren’t nearly as good as the odds that you lack even the modicum of self-awareness required to realize your own hypocrisy. 😜
7879,"As a Democrat who listens to conservative radio to gain perspective on their viewpoints, I’ve heard a lot of scrutiny of Trump being baited into responding with tangents and side-stories.

Its has sewed doubt in the minds of conservatives and has maybe encouraged some to rethink their votes!"

7881,"This is the most annoying thing about the right wing lunatics (up to and including Trump). 

Politicians have always used shaded context when they say things. They really don't often outright lie. They try to dodge questions and point to examples and facts without giving the context that might make it look bad. 

The right wing lunatics don't do that with their dishonesty. They often take something and just extrapolate and make logical leaps and exaggerations that take you from ""these fish that are normally hermaphrodites all went male because of this chemical spill"" to ""THEY'RE TURNING THE FRICKIN FROGS GAY!!"" 

But because we're so used to _everyone_ in normal life trying to say real, true things, or at the very least twisting true things to give a certain appearance that can be debunked with the correct context, we try to do the work of connecting these dots for them.

Another example is when Trump talks about immigration numbers or drug overdose deaths. He will often just make up a huge number. Then the fact checkers will be like ""some context: the actual number is 1/4 of that. Trump may be conflating [semi-related thing] to arrive at his number."" 

He isn't. He's making shit up. But we _want_ there to be a grain of truth in the dune of lies, so we go and we dig for it.

Then you get the fact checkers saying that Kamala Harris made a false statement when she said ""Trump left office with the highest unemployment since the Great Depression"" because unemployment reached ""14.8%, the highest level since the Great Depression"" in April 2020, but by the time he left office, it was down to 6.4%. 

While technically untrue, it's a slightly off representation of reality. It gets the same scrutiny and rating as ""they're allowing 20 million criminals from other countries to flood in every month""

It's maddening."
7882,"Obviously. But his crazy ramblings had an origin and that was it. That there was a chemical causing a species of fish that is naturally able to change its sex because of population distribution and in the event, it was causing them all to become male. So in his mind and way of expressing, it was ""frogs"" fish, becoming ""gay"" all male."
7883,"Weird pronounciation of “terror” might still be overlooked, but 28 spheres of terror makes no sense either."
7884,Wow there was so many bullshit things he said and I missed this one.  I really need to go back and watch it again because it was so insane.
7885,Horrible Terra
7886,"> So in his mind and way of expressing, it was ""frogs"" fish, becoming ""gay"" all male.

Does he have the mind of an adult or the mind of a child?"

7890,">*Funded by President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, EPA announces 34 selected Tribal and territorial applications through the competitive Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program*

>Today, Sept. 5, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced the selected recipients of $300 million in Climate Pollution Reduction Grants for Tribes and U.S. territories as part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing in America agenda. EPA has selected 34 applications to fund projects proposed by 33 Tribal recipients and the Municipality of Saipan in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to implement community-driven solutions to tackle the climate crisis, reduce air pollution, advance environmental justice, and accelerate the clean energy transition. EPA made its Tribes and Territories Competition selections following a review of 110 applications that requested a total of more than $1.3 billion in funding.

>The grants for the proposed projects, which are funded by President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, will support the implementation of greenhouse gas reduction measures that were identified by Tribal and territorial communities. When estimates provided by all selected applicants are combined, the proposed projects would cumulatively reduce greenhouse gas pollution by over 7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide by 2050 – equivalent to the carbon dioxide emitted from nearly 1.4 million homes' electricity use for one year.

>Today’s selections mark the latest phase of investment under this first-of-its kind, nearly $5 billion Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program. In July, EPA announced selected applications from the CPRG Implementation Grants General Competition to receive $4.3 billion in funding. In 2023, EPA provided $250 million in planning grants to develop climate action plans. Those plans served as the basis for greenhouse gas reduction measures proposed in the CPRG implementation grant applications.

>The selected applications will target greenhouse gas pollution from six sectors of the economy with a particular focus on the transportation, electric power, and commercial and residential buildings sectors, while spurring workforce development and job creation in Indian Country and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

>EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan will announce the selections alongside Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland at an event today in Flagstaff, Arizona, where they will be joined by leadership from the Hopi Tribe. The Hopi Utilities Corporation has been selected to receive over $20 million to help provide renewable and reliable electricity to nearly 900 homes.  
...  
Today’s investment and ongoing CPRG technical support for planning grant recipients are consistent with President Biden’s Executive Order 14112 on Reforming Federal Funding and Support for Tribal Nations to Better Embrace Our Trust Responsibilities and Promote the Next Era of Tribal Self-Determination. The Executive Order demonstrates the Biden-Harris Administration’s respect for Tribal sovereignty and its commitment to ushering in the next era of Tribal self-determination by directing agencies to reform federal programs for greater autonomy of Tribal Nations over how Tribes can invest federal funding. The Executive Order also directs agencies to make federal funding less burdensome and more accessible for Tribal Nations.

>The Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program is also advancing President Biden’s historic Justice40 Initiative, which aims to ensure 40% of the overall benefits of certain climate, clean energy, and other federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.

A list of a handful of recipients and the scope of their projects is in the press release, link to full list is towards the bottom. Statement from EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan:

>“Thanks to President Biden and Vice President Harris’ leadership, today’s investment marks one of the largest climate investments EPA has ever made in Tribal and territorial communities. The ambitious projects selected will deploy community-driven solutions to fight climate change and protect public health,” said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan. “The Tribal and territory leaders selected today will fund innovative projects that improve air quality, deliver cleaner affordable electricity, and create economic and workforce opportunities that can be scaled up and replicated across Tribal lands and U.S. territories.”

7898,"As Harris said on stage, she is not Biden and certainly not Trump. She is a compassionate and articulate leader. She cares about people which is Biden too but certainly not Trump. And, she is articulate unlike the other two.

If I dare say it, Harris's voice may even be greater than Obama's. The country will be lucky to have her as President. If she also has Congress with her, much will be accomplished so that the country will be on the right path for the next generation.

We must all work together to make that happen. Go vote in November and vote Blue!"
7899,"Biden is still stuck in the Old School fallacy that Republicans are still their friends who have just ""Lost their Way"" and just need a few more hugs to recover. 

Harris knows that the vast majority of them have knowingly embraced evil and cannot be redeemed."
7900,"Maybe but in 2020, Biden did kick Trump's teeth in during the debate as well. Let's not sell the man who booted Trump from The White House short. He's a legend in his own right "
7901,The only way she could have been any better is if she cryp walked off the stage to Not Like Us
7902,"I think Kamala did great, of coarse, but I kinda wish she’d answered these 2 questions a little differently:
1) Our biggest mistake in Afghanistan was we stuck too closely to Donald Trump’s plan.
2) The border bill was introduced when it was because it took 3+ years to get anything at all through the Republican members of Congress. And Donald Trump killed it anyway."
7903,"Great debate performance by Kamala. She was composed, confident, articulate, passionate, and well-prepared. Like every other politician who has ever run for President, she dodged uncomfortable questions but at least answered with related material before promptly shifting gears to her preferred talking points. However, the one thing she did better than Biden ever could was to bait Trump, and he bit every time . . . hook, line, and sinker. She had him on defense for most of the debate while he wouldn't even look in her direction and appeared uncomfortable, angry, and/or frustrated throughout.

My favorite part was watching Trump's response to her little dig about his campaign crowds. The change in his facial expression looked like he blew a fuse and he couldn't help but take the bait. Then Kamala just smiled as Trump derailed and never recovered. Priceless!"
7904,"Speak, in complete, coherent sentences"
7905,She articulated her thoughts and didnt advocate for beating up Medicare? Thats a high bar for democrats.
7906,Stay awake?
7907,Vote for Kamala...make America great again! ;)
7908,"Kamala inspired me to apply for an early mail-in ballot!

Vote blue!"
7909,"This is why I'm actually excited for Harris, I'm sick and tired of democrats just shaking hands with Republicans well they get screwed over"
7910,"He'll always have ""Will you shut up, man?"""
7911,"Preach it! Biden has also been the most effective Democratic President in office for progressive and democratic causes since before Carter, at least."
7912,"I kinda agree.
AFAIK Trump had no plan for leaving Afghanistan.
Now she can talk about Trumps meeting with Abdul.

Regretting that 13 soldiers were killed, may be the way to go in Townhalls."
7913,"I really, really wanted her to respond to his “You didn’t fire anyone related to Afghanistan” with “Well, we fired you.”"
7914,Why wouldn’t she stay awake? She’s not Diaper Don in a court room.
7915,[wrong one](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/05/trump-manhattan-trial-sleep/678268/)
7916,"Need both, Biden had a way of still getting something through congress at times…"
7917,I appreciate the mods not taking the bait when Trump said that he “learned about the immigrants eating pets from television”. He must have been watching Fox 😂

7921,Excellent!!  Perfect timing too!
7922,Swifties! Assemble.
7923,"ladies...please help this country this Nov

*a sixty yr old guy*"
7924,"Wow, who expected that?    Donald will be melting, if his staff is smart, his phone will be confiscated."
7925,Finally!
7926,"And just like that, the debate is old news.

Surprised she didn't wait a bit longer, but glad to have her endorsement, if only for the boost that Harris can get from this."
7927,"Shouldn’t have posted the AI image, idiot"
7928,"Good luck, Don!"
7929,"Well, TS does have a higher IQ than Einstein. I personally couldn't name one song by her, but if it's for the cause, I'm happy."
7930,It’s swift and Dick Cheney to the rescue!
7931,"So Taylor Swift supports eating dogs and cats, got it."
7932,"Everyone says “perfect timing” 

But I think it’s weird timing, why this late, why right after the debate and not on a slow news day. Are some states past the registration deadline? 

I’m 100% sure it’s not the case but it makes it seem like she was holding out to see who won the debate so she could put her support behind the candidate with the most momentum"
7933,Have people lost their minds? Taylor Swift isn’t swinging the election. No one wants to focus on actual issues we ALL face. That includes Trump and Harris.
7934,"As another cat lady, I am united with you, Taylor, and Kamala!"
7935,This is the needed evolution of Swift boating.
7936,"I'm sure that was the point. She noted it in her caption, too, that she likes to read up and listen to all the candidates before making a choice. This was the best time to do it."
7937,There’s going to be catsup on the walls of Mar-a-Lago tonight! So much catsup. BIGLy catsup!
7938,If they take away his phone how is he gonna get Kid Rock to come to his aid?
7939,Hopefully it gets even more people to see that glorious debate. Harris deserves the attention.
7940,What person over the age of 10 refers to IQ
7941,"This is a lie, and a very stupid one."
7942,You can't seriously believe that.
7943,Try one… eat the kitty
7944,"You've identified what makes it perfect timing in your post. Taylor Swift just gave every single one of her fans a reason to say they're voting for her candidate that isn't just ""Taylor Swift said so."" She also took full control of the messaging around the debate win.


It's hard to say Harris lost the debate when the biggest name on the planet comes out immediately and says she won it so much that she's won an endorsement."
7945,"If it gets more people to pay attention to the debate itself, I'm all for it."
7946,"Pretty well done timing. No sound person can criticize her for supporting Harris after seeing the beating little Donald took. She’s the more competent, trustworthy, intelligent, compassionate and sane of the two by miles. 

Surely she’s around quite a few ultra conservative billionaires and also republican Midwest football fans and family members now, but after that, she was like “Yeah, it’s a no fucking brainer for me. Harris is the pick. If you disagree, do your own research”."
7947,"Let’s be real though (and this is NOT criticism), she was just doing that to sound like a role model for her younger audience. She was never even considering voting for Trump."
7948,"I was just being funny. Sorry my sense of humour is dry, doesn't translate to text, and is not for everyone. Thanks for the down vote. You made my day"
7949,Pretty sure it’s actually sarcasm
7950,And she gave them links to register to vote and links to vote early
7951,She waited to make sure Harris didn’t pull a Biden before endorsing
7952,Oh of course.
7953,"Should have dropped the /s, I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
7954,"I want to say it’s too ridiculous to need one, but with the crazy shit they talk about I guess nothing is too crazy to be possible"

7956,"""Childless cat lady.""

Fucking YES QUEEN."
7957,This is actually significant right?
7958,">Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth. I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election

Its Trump's own damn fault lol he poked the bear."
7959,Nail meet coffin.
7960,"""Childless cat lady"" was a nice touch"
7961,"> Swift wrote to her more than 280 million Instagram followers

280 MILLION?!"
7962,"And she called out Trump for his use of AI to falsify her endorsement. Finally. Relentless calling out of his BS. Hopefully this along with her debate performance tonight gives her the traction she needs to secure presidency. Everyone double check your registration, vote, and get others to do the same!"
7963,An amazing endorsement from Taylor Swift.   Her comments were well articulated and wonderful to read.
7964,It goes from bad to worse for Dump. Great night!
7965,Pack it up boys.  It's been decided.
7966,"Oh shit, it’s done now!"
7967,Check out the picture with her statement. She’s holding a CAT!!!!  Beautiful.
7968,He’s cooked
7969,Taylor will be pissed if you don’t vote.
7970,The comical thing is the number of likes on her insta post is probably a better poll than anything else put out so far
7971,Trump just got Swift-voted.
7972,It's Joever
7973,Orange Griselda is gonna have a fit!
7974,"You know what would be sweet?

If she receives presidential medal and the Congress passes a resolution to officially give her the title, Miss Americana"

7979,It's over.
7980,Watch JD vance double down and insult her
7981,Oof
7982,It’s Swift and Dick Cheney to the rescue.
7983,Which people are fool enough to change their votes according to a billionaire wishes?
7984,"I love this for women everywhere. 

We are going to do this!! <3333"
7985,"Oh yeah? What about Lana Del Rey? Yeah, just you all wait."
7986,It’s a big club and you ain’t in it
7987,It was the Maholmes stuff that finally made her have to speak up
7988,Didn’t she already endorse Trump?
7989,Wherever Kid Rock is a way better musican then her anyway he is from the street and knows what it's like to be a hard working American she is from privledge.
7990,“Cuz this moment has to be about me!”
7991,"Holy shit who fucking cares? This has been posted thirty times in the last ten minutes in here. 

""The swifties are here, pack it in fellas"". My god shut up lmao.

She's a singer. Whoopdie doo.

E: Uh oh, I've unleashed the wrath of ""swifties"". My god, I don't know if I'll survive this."
7992,"Taylor Swift quoted JD Vance, greatness achieved"
7993,YES!!! It’s going to resonate with so many childless cat ladies this November.
7994,Both Yes and Queen were great bands but I don’t see what that has to do with this post?
7995,She has a huge and loyal fan base of young women who likely consider reproductive rights/freedom a (if not the) primary concern in this election.
7996,"I think there is a statistically significant group of young people who would not have voted otherwise, who will now because Taylor encouraged them to"
7997,YES!!! She already has 2.6 million likes on Instagram post.
7998,"Considering she has millions of fans who would mindlessly do what she tells them to, yes"
7999,"Yes. Millions of young people are really, really obsessed with her. Like, somewhat unhealthily. 

And young people are overwhelmingly liberal BUT tend not to vote. This can only help turnout in a crucial demographic. It's kinda sad but yes, this matters."
8000,It depends.  Does she just make a statement once?  No?  Does she promote GOTV efforts to her millions and millions of fans?  Yes.
8001,"With 284m Instagram followers, if just 0.25% of those people vote for Harris who would not have voted or would have voted for Trump, that is 710,000 additional voters, we’ll round it to 750k for even math. 

2016 and 2020 were decided by 80,000 and 44,000 votes in six swing states. 

So yes, this is significant. 

However if Taylor wants to truly affect the campaign, she needs to make some stadium appearances, a few additional posts. Even better if she gets televised time on stage speaking about voting for Harris. 

If those hypothetical 750k are split evenly between  all 50 states, currently that is 15,000 per state. Between those six swing states, that is an additional 90,000 votes in key districts (hypothetically). 

So it’s not nothing, but without following it with further action probably won’t shift the entire race by itself, but will definitely add to Harris’ post-debate media blitz. 

Winning the debate isn’t as important as winning the post-debate media cycle. Swift’s endorsement will help Kamala do that, which is a far bigger factor. 

Now if Taylor starts getting on stage and promoting voting for Harris, expect to QUICKLY see Republicans start calling for laws banning celebrity interference in elections (lol). “Rules for thee, but not for me when it starts making my team lose”, and all that."
8002,With a picture of her and her cat
8003,YES 283 to be exact!!!
8004,"And waiting until after the debate to mention one thing about that AI breach.

Well played."
8005,"And perfectly timed, after articulating, she watched the full debate."
8006,"Nope.

Don’t get complacent, this is be close until Election Day.

VOTE!"
8007,"Literally poster the screenshot of her post it in a friend groups discord saying the same thing. Pack it up. See ya in 4 years. 

In all seriousness vote. Glad she is doing the right thing. But vote"
8008,"We still need to volunteer, make phone calls, write post cards, known on doors, donate, and help make the case for Harris and Democrats up and down the ballot!!"
8009,nah. volunteer and work hard. bring friends to the polls.
8010,It’s Joever
8011,"It is!!! Though, we cannot get complacent."
8012,she's gotta do way way way more for charity and then revisit the idea
8013,Elon already did
8014,Not many and the real difference made is those that weren’t going to vote at all now choosing to vote for Kamala. For many this will be the first time voting.
8015,Who?
8016,No it wasn’t.
8017,"No, lol. She excoriated Trump during the 2020 election too.

Trump must be so mad now. Getting spanked by Harris in the debate and now this? LOL."
8018,"The Kid Rock who sang: 
""Young ladies, young ladies, I like 'em underage see
Some say that's statutory (But I say it's mandatory)""

That Kid Rock?"
8019,"Terrible trolling. 

Trolling is an art, this is just mimicry of it."
8020,Kid Rick is from a wealthy family what are you taking about 😂
8021,"I don’t know what’s more amusing, the laughable take that kid rock is a better musician or the idea that trump reoresents hard workers rather than  privilege"
8022,Hell yeah. Bob has always respected the female-body-politic 🤘😜
8023,She is highly influential among a key demographic that would boost democrat chances to win.  It's actually newsworthy.
8024,"My brother, I don’t think you understand. This isn’t kid rock"
8025,You are massively underestimating her fan base and you show a lack of understanding for how our culture currently operates.
8026,Is that less impressive than a reality game show host?
8027,[deleted]
8028,She’s a singer with tens of millions of young people in the palm of her hand.
8029,"Millions of Swifty of voting age, and Swifties below voting age who will pressure their parents. That's who cares."
8030,She has a huge near cult following that absolutely will vote for who she tells them to. This does matter and could easily help decide the election.
8031,Donald is going to care
8032,Prog rockers unite!
8033,And 280+ fans on socials.
8034,"I give her credit. She seems to steer her fan base to think, as opposed to mindlessly follow....but, I'm ok if they mindlessly follow her on this!"
8035,"Give them some credit, they started mobilizing on their own the moment Vance said ""childless cat lady"" 

I don't blame them as a childless dog lady."

8038,Ya know I’d decided that she had it in the bag and wasn’t gonna vote. But your comment turned me around. You’ve saved the election!
8039,TSwifts endorsement arguably moved the needle MORE than the GD debate!  There's no amount I can legally donate that will have any significance on the level of a TWEET.

But still, it feels so good to see some karma in action."
8053,I can see you are having a bad night. Enjoy your hungry man dinner!
8054,"I understand you may not, but I'm answering your ""who fucking cares"" question."
8055,You’re posting on Reddit… that’s about as unproductive as one can get.
8056,Was that supposed to be a dig? Wtf was that 😂
8057,"With such spice and condescendence! Bravo. You may now go to sleep thinking ""Pff, fuck yea. Got em."""
8058,"Which would make sense as to why I'm electing to not answer your question wouldn't it?

Kinda shooting yourself in the foot with that statement."

8060,"Umm... Ok?
     

It's 1.39pm, I'll stay up a little longer.    
   
Also if you think I'm devoting any brain power to this short exchange beyond how long it takes me to type this out, you're mistaken."

8062,I refuse. Not until the hungry man dinner bit is expanded on.
8063,"Trust me, you exerting any brain power here never crossed my mind friend.

Whoops! That was someone else 😂 sorry about that. You all blend together eventually it's hard to differentiate."

8088,What the fuck? Dude is just obsessive about wanting attention.
8089,"This was overlooked because Twitter has become an ocean of MAGA tears tonight, but it was genuinely one of the weirdest Tweets ever from a terminally online weirdo who's lost all sense of norms because all of his interactions take place in a right wing cesspool."
8090,"There’s no way to interpret that comment that isn’t creepy af

Ew"
8091,That’s super weird and gross
8092,"Why would you want another child that wants nothing to do with you?


Also, that's a super fucking weird comment to make.


Edit: Here's the full quote


>Fine Taylor … you win … I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life


https://archive.is/tQbXS


Edit2: Also using ellipsis like that annoys the fuck out of me. Are you self-filtering even worse misogynistic commentary?"
8093,Just weird and creepy. And conservatives wonder why they're losing women's votes. Comments like this from people who support them don't help.
8094,What the actual fuck is wrong with this weirdo?
8095,Elon Musk threatening to rape Taylor Swift wasn't on my bingo card.
8096,Wut?
8097,What a fucking weirdo
8098,Elon Musk is a turd.
8099,What the fuck is that supposed to mean⁉️
8100,Incel
8101,"Incel weirdo.


Can we have Travis Kelce just launch him into the sun or something?!"
8102,Poor weirdo. Swift wouldn't touch you with a ten foot pole.
8103,Ewww
8104,"""I will give you a child...""


Gross, he's going off on a macho dude tantrum.


""...and guard your cats with my life.""


....and now he just admitted to the world it's some weirdo fantasy crush. It's like the concept of embarrassment doesn't exist for these people. This shit is *embarrassing*."
8105,"I see Elon is down the k hole again.

Dude must had had to double his usual dose after watching Trump's absolutely failure of a debate."
8106,"Is he talking about disowning one of his existing children or impregnating Taylor?

Gross and weird either way."
8107,"this isn't only superficially disgusting, it's also extra disgusting because a lot of these rich white guys who think they are big brain geniuses are really into this breeding shit. and I don't mean the religious quiverfull kind, I mean like Pavel Durov having donated enough sperm to have fathered 100 kids.

but it's not only that -- there are groups dedicated to these things and if you read about Jonathan Jacob Meijer or watch the documentary about him on netflix (""The Man with 1000 Kids""), you can see that it stems from a very insidious white supremacist ideology. 

Elon has what, at least 12 kids, but is known to try to recruit women to have more with him. it's beyond just a normal kind of sick sexual fantasy or just a weird thing to say, it's a racist fetish."
8108,what a creep
8109,This looks way too much like hes threatening to rape Taylor Swift. Wtf.
8110,hopefully trump takes elon with him when he flees the country after his election loss
8111,"Jesus fucking christ, he just publicly threatened rape. What the actual fuck."
8112,"Oh look, another malignant narcissist. Thank God this one was born in South Africa and can't become our president. I used to like Teslas but now I would never ever buy one."
8113,"What a creep.  
I understand why his kids dosnt want anything to do with him..."
8114,"Just reading Taylors mind: ""dude...I wouldn't fuck you if you were the last man on earth""."
8115,Creepy dude says a thing.
8116,"Dude, she doesn’t want your D."
8117,"On top of everything she's in a relationship with a guy who makes Elon look like a complete beta. Even as a ""joke"" this makes him so fucking pathetic."
8118,Elon looks exactly like the type of guy who would be a creep. Lets not forget his ties with Epstein and Maxwell
8119,"Why in god’s name do men feel free to say the most vile shit to and about women? Like where the fuck is your head that you’d even think, let alone post, something like this?"
8120,"He had sex with a pop star, so he thinks he's now an expert and can have sex with any pop star."
8121,What a creep.
8122,Creepy man. Can he even care for his kids if he hates women so much
8123,"Elon Musk is the archetypal MAGA Republican.

* creepy forced-birth fetish

* pathological liar

* rants against nonsensical “woke mind virus”…MAGA wing-nut shorthand for tolerance, celebrating diversity and rejecting narrow-minded socially medieval worldviews. 

* transphobic bigot who publicly dead named his own child

* rancid hypocrite whose “free speech absolutism” only applies to Elon’s preferred viewpoints, while others are shamelessly censored or buried at his whim in circumstances under his control 

* uses his ownership of Twitter to actively peddle misinformation, promote batshit conspiracy gibberish—specializing in xenophobic nonsense—and enable bigoted hate-monger scum like transphobic stochastic terrorist Chaya Raichik to ply their despicable trades with unfettered glee

* just to name a few examples"
8124,Such an incel thing to say.
8125,Spoiled loser says what?
8126,Disgusting fucking slob. Is this dude ok?
8127,Any time I hear about this guy I think about the time he got booed at a Dave Chappelle performance and I just smile
8128,Dude just ***shut the fuck up***
8129,"Disgusting fucking creep.  

Had Leon been born without a slave labor fortune up his apartheid supporting ass, he would be the lonely incel he cosplays online.  But having money fooled him into thinking women actually want to be near him."
8130,"What a delusional, dumb dipshit."
8131,That's a really weird comment.
8132,Elmo that's fucking weird. Also.... do you really want to pick a fight with Taylor fucking Swift? Are you stupid?
8133,[deleted]
8134,X needs be shut down immediately. The CEO literally threatens to rape a woman. wtf…
8135,"Elon has essentially threatened to rape Taylor.

God knows Taylor wouldn't come in same room with him willingly so how can he give her a child other than by forcing her?

That is some implicit threat.

Elon Musk is genuinely a piece of shit."
8136,"Breeding fetish billionaire with the body of a baked potato tells pop star with boyfriend that he wants to fuck her.  

Nice one Leon."
8137,... ew
8138,What in the actual fuck?
8139,this made my eyes pop out of my head. what the FUCK
8140,What a fucking creepy weirdo. I hope I'll live long enough to see him disappear from the public discourse completely.
8141,"I thought it would be hard for him to be more vile and ugly.

He is like an animated turd."
8142,"Is he threatening give her one of his neglected bastards or to rape her? Either way, he should probably get Taylor-Tay’s name out of his mouth."
8143,Ketamine took the wrong celebrity. RIP Matthew Perry.
8144,Her boyfriend should kick Leon's ass.
8145,This is disgusting
8146,Musk offered to rape Taylor Swift? America really needs to deport this creep.
8147,…did Elon just threaten to Rape Taylor Swift!?
8148,"I just barfed in my mouth.

Fucking gross.

I am a man, and I just want to apologize to everyone everywhere for this level of mysoginistic stupidity. Leon even makes me embarassed to be a man."
8149,"Eww. Full stop 

Eww. Weird"
8150,and this … in his mind … is what passes for wit.
8151,Of course she would say no though so...is that a threat of sexual assault?
8152,"Why doesn't Elmo offer $1 Billion to anyone  who can present Trump's ""irrefutable proof"" of wide-spread election fraud?"
8153,Fucking gross.
8154,"He has 11 children and believes in the ""great replacement"" theory and thats why he's doing his ""part"". 
I mean i knew Musk was an asshole but *damn*...
That tells you all you need to know about this clown. He's so *disgusting*. No wonder he supports Trump. 
Also why is everyone so creepy with Taylor Swift? You got that AI Trump endorsement, the AI porn, and now this, and there's probably something else out there."
8155,"Ew. Not that Musk wasn't weird to begin with, but he's decided to go Trump weird."
8156,thats just fucking gross
8157,"Assuming she wants a child , much like Vance he can’t comprehend women not wanting to have children"
8158,Creepy
8159,Ewww
8160,She can afford to choose better.
8161,Gross and weird.
8162,Ok Elon …you just threatened to rape Taylor Swift … wow
8163,Eww!
8164,"So that’s a public threat of rape, right? Is there really any other way to take it?"
8165,Sounds like a threat of sexual assault.
8166,"End all of his government contracts today, let NASA seize SpaceX"
8167,"I reckon she can do better than an already deadbeat dad to multiple kids. When's he going to find time to parent *or* guard cats when he's running five companies, working as tech support for Catturd and Ian Miles Cheong, and tweeting 50 times a day?"
8168,Another weirdo
8169,"Ewwww, weirdo."
8170,Ew.
8171,I ever someone needed to be dethroned it's this deluded fuck-knuckle.
8172,I refuse to believe this is the timeline we are living in.  It is fucking nuts when Taylor swift is more sane and eloquent then anyone in the republicans ever could be.
8173,"This is the absolute weirdest timeline.

Our democracy apparently revolves around a bunch of creepy rich dudes and a pop star."
8174,I hope Travis Kelce weighs in on this creeper saying weird shit to his girl.
8175,This guy is a creep
8176,He doesn't sound like a man.
8177,"What is twisted, sick pig Musk is. I am not insulting Elon - just making an honest observation"
8178,"He jumped the creepy shark. He's no longer just a weird asshole, he's a full blown creep. "
8179,"Imagine if some billionaire bought a social media platform, and then use it to publicly insult women by offering to impregnate them when they clearly want nothing to do with him. Oh right, that’s the reality we live in…"
8180,Isn’t this creepy/ rape threatening behavior restraining order worthy?
8181,More value wiped off $TSLA.  Shame.
8182,Ketamine must be one heck of a drug.
8183,"Sweet Mother of God, I hope Kelce brothers meet this loon in some dark alley."
8184,"These rich, should keep their crazy end of world visions to themselves, we don’t have a shortage of such ourselves!"
8185,"Elmo’s being a creep, again.🙄"
8186,That guy went from hero to zero real fast.
8187,Ewwww!
8188,He’s just creepy.
8189,"He’s such a wacko. 

Deluded, nutty, wacko."
8190,This man needs professional help.
8191,He'll have to go through Travis Kelce first.
8192,i need Travis vs Leon cagefight for xmas pls
8193, Because Elon is “just like his dad”.
8194,Ewe
8195,This is gross
8196,Totally normal not creepy at all
8197,I… this has a lot of really gross layers. I don’t really care about her music but I think she has higher standards than scum like Leon
8198,He should start by being a father to his children. All of them.
8199,Let's all report this post on Twitter as inapropriate and dishumaning.
8200,Ew.
8201,Maybe he and Trump can head for Mars together
8202,"You all got that wrong. He was offering to give her one of his children, as a sacrifice."
8203,This guy needs to be removed from the general population
8204,Parade of weird
8205,"what a vile, despicable POS.  I am sure he thought he was being funny (in part because he was most likely high as shit), but it's just disgusting."
8206,"Well, that’s fucking gross"
8207,This is honestly rape threat territory. What a creepy fucker.
8208,Leon was upset after hearing Trump during the debate claim he's the leader in fertilization
8209,This is the world we live in?
8210,Hey creepy fucking weirdo nobody wants your gross sperm
8211,"That is called rape, Leon"
8212,"Kind of sounds like a rape threat? I will give you …
She should call him out and ask him to explain exactly what he means."
8213,"Kind of sounds like a rape threat? I will give you …
She should call him out and ask him to explain exactly what he means."
8214,Elon Musk is a creepy perv with an insemination fetish.
8215,This creepy fuck needs to just go to mars and leave the rest of us alone. He can take all his shithead fans with him too.
8216,The man is as creepy as Donald Trump is weird!
8217,"Supposing I'm an undecided or independent voter in a swing state.  I see this tweet, and I think, ""Yup, voting for Trump""?

Really?"
8218,"Ah yes Elon.. The epitome of family values, with his 12 children from 3 different wifes, that want nothing to do with him anymore. Did you know that Elon has autism as well? Could explain some of his behavior.."

8220,"Seuntje, gaa terug kraal toe! Jy is dronk!"
8221,You want this guy's app on your phone?
8222,What ?!
8223,Travis Kelce should challenge him to a boxing match. 
8224,Surely he’s not thinking he could ever have a chance in hell of having sex with her and instead means he’ll just give her one of his many already existing children (it’s obviously he doesn’t care for them anyway)
8225,Idk what is worse the quote or the headline. Seriously elon does not care about and probably welcomes population collapse
8226,Tesla is now selling electric powered babies now!
8227,what a fucking creepy weirdo
8228,"She's a billionaire. If she wanted a kid or protection for her cat, I'm pretty sure she could arrange for either one, or both,  if she wants."
8229,His name is Leon! So sayeth the orange one!
8230,He is not only a scum dog but a deadbeat father to his own transgender kid.  What makes him think he’s a catch? C’mon he ain’t all and the bag of chips.  Taylor dear u may have bad moments … but I’m sure u don’t have bad taste… besides he sounds like orangina … a proven sexual molester on a dept. store … wow 🧐
8231,The worlds most divorced dad yuck!
8232,"I was impressed by Swift's endorsement.  Cogent, calm and low-key snarky all at the same time.
 
On the other hand, I'll happily pay for pay-per-view when Travis Kelce gets five minutes alone with Elon Musk."
8233,He needs to lay off the ketamine
8234,Did you see that Travis?😏
8235,Ew
8236,Eww dude. wtf. He’s so gross
8237,What am I reading?
8238,"In a matter of 18 months, he's transformed his public image from billionaire nerd hero to right-wing King of Cringe. What a sad shallow human he is"
8239,Weird.
8240,"Hei rocket man, she doesn’t want your sperm"
8241,"AI will succeed in the end because what these right wing ass holes want is a girlfriend who will wholeheartedly prop up their egos. This compass that guides Elon Musk and the “manosphere” that Trump is courting for votes. 

Elon Musk will help create the population collapse he supposedly fears by funding the creation of virtual girlfriends. "
8242,"""I will give you an autistic child"" FTFY"
8243,"Just a reminder that he is in a custody battle with Grimes, one of the women who he has had kids with, and her mom has posted some really sad crap on Twitter about how he treats his kids and his wife's family. So it makes it even more gross that he still wants to impregnate more women. [https://x.com/Garossino/status/1817220477427093963](https://x.com/Garossino/status/1817220477427093963)"
8244,"Dude was just trying to be funny. You guys take shit too serious. If an elite makes a comment or a joke people will take every single letter, space, and comma in the message and try to analyze it through a microscope. Plus the childless cat lady “endorsing” Kamala does nothing in my opinion. Anyone else give a fuck who Taylor Swift is voting for? I don’t."
8245,I mean pretty clearly hes not threatening her but he is a moron
8246,Ha ha. Funny 🙄
8247,Basically like Trump
8248,"Thank fuck he can't run for US president, though I'm sure the supreme court will see to that."
8249,That’s what malignant narcissists do.
8250,"Well yes, but more importantly he's got an impregnation fetish and he's made it everyone's fuckin problem"
8251,I heard that everyone is saying he’s a pedophile.
8252,Again he’s disgusting and another bullshitter … I’m sure she’s got better likings … yuck I’d rather be w my cats 
8253,This was my exact thought…. WTF??  She’s not in your league bro!
8254,He’s a freak who doubled down again on trump after this terrible debate
8255,I didn’t think he could get any weirder or cringier after the doge tweet but I guess I was wrong.
8256,Twitter is going to end up like Trump’s Truth Social a Joke and a Loser.
8257,And he wonders why he is losing advertisers on Twitter and why Tesla is out of fashion.
8258,Maybe he's trying to get rid of X AE A-whatever. Then it's just despicable.
8259,Please Elon leave Taylor alone.
8260,"The right wing is starting to get more and more weirder it's unbelievable, no wonder Twitter is falling off, its just become full of these people. I liked it for the art accoujts but it's making me reconsider.
Weird Elon. Weird Trump. WEIRD REPUBLICANS!"
8261,This is beyond weird and creepy. He is publicly making threats of rape.
8262,This man just continually proves himself to be the worlds biggest douche. Why doesn't he just get a he mans women haters tattoo already. He has the maturity level of a 10yo adolescent mixed with the superiority complex of a 17yo teen and the ruthlessness of a 5yo on a tantrum.
8263,You might have to get through Travis Kelce first Elon.
8264,The ellipses are bad but with a space it’s ignorant buffoon territory
8265,Elon has a breeding fetish.
8266,"Elon leaning into being a dead beat dad of multiple bastard kids he’s sired?

8275,"I think it implies that Elon wants to impregnate Taylor?

Which really is an all kinds of fucked up to say."

8277,Exactly what you think.
8278,"“joking” that since taylor called herself a “childless cat lady” in response to what vance said, he wants to impregnate her.

very inappropriate and reads very rapey."
8279,"Taylor wrote that she will vote for Harris and Waltz and signed it ""childless cat lady"" so Elon's ""joke"" is that she won, she made him wanna give her a baby and take care of her cats so she will be woman with kids and without cats and will vote for Trump. But because of how that stupid platform works nobody sees the context, not that it makes it better and not a gross joke at simpleton level..."

8282,"I never watch sports, and I would watch Travis Kelce and Elon Musk in a boxing/MMA/whatever ring on *repeat*. *Forever.* Kelce would absolutely destroy him."
8283,"taylor herself is in great shape, i think she could kick his ass"

8285,Actually the cat thing is a new racism that just dropped
8286,"""again"" implies that he ever came back up again."
8287,He is. He's veiling it *just enough* to prevent legal action since she's one of the few people in the world with both the clout and money to crush him in a legal fight. But a veiled threat is still a threat.
8288,This dick doesn’t speak for men. If someone said this to my daughter I’d have a strong urge to find a way to end him.
8289,It was the little head who made that coment
8290,And he wonders why advertisers don’t want to advertise on his platform.

8295,I look forward to the Taylor Swift song about how Elon Musk and Nick Cannon begging to knock her up made her cringe her way to another dimension.
8296,Treat him like a god he believes he is a god.
8297,He had enough puppets to run for him.
8298,"I have a lurker account just for art and YouTube creators I like, but enough is enough, I’m deleting it.

I can wait for everyone I fallow to move onto Bluesky or other services."
8299,Not just weird. Weird and creepy. Big time
8300,"Maybe he's offering to give her one of his kids? He has heaps and doesn't seem to like them very much. 

Either way, Leon is fucked in the head."
8301,It does come across as a rape threat even he says “I was joking.”. Him and TFG need a classic Russian window oopsie.
8302,"Yeah, he didn't say ""I could give you a child"", he said ""I **will""**. He just publicly *promised* to rape her. Seems to be the go-to threat for these types of pathetic men when they're scared of a woman. He thinks he's lost power to her and this is his way of trying to take it back."
8303,"No he is trying to troll her, trivializing her words and her endorsement. And reducing it to the cat lady bit..he thinks he's owning her..Musk has been peddling in this jokester, poop emoji, fratty humour for a while now..man fancies himself a comedian. Its funny to see- it started with that lame ass dick swinging contest he had with Mark Zuckerberg in April and his attempts to seem cool and with it with courting artists to join Twitter thing hes been doing for a while. The thing is swagger is innate and Musk doesn't have it. He's charisma less and just comes off try hard. I used to be a fan and it's crazy what he has become."
8304,"Elon doesn’t have sex, he prefers IVF. Which, while nothing is wrong with IVF (how I got my kid), is kinda weird to do that with multiple women."
8305,That’s how I read it too.
8306,All that loot and he still can't afford a personality transplant.
8307,Pls let this happen it would be so funny
8308,Don’t give Elon ideas. We just want Elon to leave Taylor Swift alone.
8309,"Or the entire team and potentially organized sports.


Man publicly threatens to rape celebrity.


Or


Man publicly offers child trafficking services.


Which one?"
8310,I've been quoting that scene in my head a LOT these days.
8311,I agree. I should have said disgusting and disturbing. And even that doesn't fully capture it.
8312,It’s truly vile. He really is a POS.
8313,"Leon is a supreme scumbag but I don't think so. Even many (most?) of his own kids were IVF. He seems to have some sort of breeding fetish. And like other narcissists like Trump, he's definitively convinced that he has 'superior genes' that all women would be fighting for their kids to have.

Also, between his abuse of Ketamine and HGH, his age, and lack of fitness, I wouldn't be surprised if he couldn't get it up in the first place."
8314,"that’s not what he seems to be attempting to imply, but it definitely reads very rapey"
8315,"No, he's making an autistic ""joke""."
8316,"Not really, she signed “Childless cat lady”, and he replied with a weird take on that. A really weird take."
8317,It sounds rapey
8318,"Oh no, pay attention. Elon didn't IMPLY that he WANTS to impregnate Taylor, he said plain and simple that he will impregnate Taylor. Maybe he's had dreams where he does that, the um non-dry kind of dreams. And he can no longer tell the difference between his dreams and reality because of the substances he's consuming. All in all, it's fscking awesome that the US is increasingly giving this man power over our national security."
8319,">I think it implies that Elon wants to impregnate Taylor?

Far worse than that.  ""I will give you a child"" isn't an expression of want.  It's a threat of something that Elon will make happen which Taylor has no say in."
8320,Travis Kelce literally beating up oligarchs in retirement is both the hero we need and deserve right now.
8321,It would be over in 5 seconds...
8322,You should have that strong urge if someone says that about *any* woman 
8323,Treat them... like a god.  There are so many in this world like them.
8324,He already has a puppet on the ticket.
8325,Do the art people ever go to like Instagram or Threads or whatever? Can you follow them there? Twitter usership is falling off a cliff.
8326,"My breaking point came in July when Musk openly endorsed Trump. That was it—I was done. IMO Musk is just as much of a creep, liar, and con as Trump himself. I deleted my X account, sold my Tesla, and dumped my stock. I refuse to support anything tied to that mess. Now, I’ve moved to Tribel, a far more thoughtful, artsy, and liberal platform where real conversations happen. It was created in 2022 as a alternative after Twitter was purchased by Musk."
8327,"> He has heaps and doesn't seem to like them very much.

... and has zero regard for their mothers' opinion about giving them away."
8328,I love the idea of everyone calling him Leon from now on
8329,"Nah, he doesn’t think he has kids because he believes they’ve all died to the “woke mind virus”, whatever the hell that is. Probably some weird right wing dog whistle. He really doesn’t see that he’s the one common denominator across all his failed relationships with women and his own children."
8330,"He’s suggesting that an absent father is the equivalent of a childless woman who has cats.  Way to make it about yourself, dude."
8331,">He just publicly promised to rape her.

Ok that's a leap and a half."
8332,Taylor Swift is the one person not to do this to. She has a rather impressive record of putting creepy men in their place in a public way.
8333,That doesn’t mean it wasn’t a whitewashed rape joke.
8334,He was hoping the hair transplant would make up for it.
8335,i would even make a twitter acc to see that
8336,"Fancies himself some kind of doughy Genghis Khan, just without literally anything positive to come of his genetic contribution."
8337,"The superior genes are probably ninjas.

Or at least invisible."
8338,">that’s not what he seems to be attempting to imply, but it definitely reads very rapey

Plenty of rapists don't view their actions as rape."
8339,"Musk **IS** an autistic joke.  


And also the reason people like to take the piss when you're smart and autistic but not a mega billionaire like the muck ox. 


 /rant from frustrated autistic person "
8340,"Could you explain what about his “joke” is autistic, please? I don’t understand."
8341,">Not really, she signed “Childless cat lady”, and he replied with a weird take on that. A really weird take.

His ""weird take"" is that he was going to rape her."
8342,I dunno. I’m not willing to go to jail defending Taylor Swift from a verbal threat. I don’t think it is unreasonable to have a more unhinged response when it’s my own child.
8343,You expect too much. They don't care until it affects a woman they're related to for some reason.
8344,Did this make sense to you when you typed it? In what way is that being suggested?
8345,I'm not sure what you're trying to say here. Your syntax does not make sense. Please try again. Or just continue drinking.
8346,"IDK what would you call it when someone says they're GOING to have sex with you, even though you've pretty publicly expressed your disgust with them/lack of desire to have sex with them..?

Because to me, that sounds like a rape threat. I'm real tired of letting men hide behind, 'He didn't mean it like THAT!' or 'He was just JOKING!'

Explain it then. Explain the joke. What is funny about forcing yourself on someone who doesn't want you. Go ahead. I'll wait."
8347,Yes but I say we run with it!
8348,"Yeah I'm not a fan and do not consider her to be this flawless, perfect, morally upright person. That being said, I'm glad she chose to be vocal finally.  And I was impressed by her behavior during her assault trial. Set a great example."
8349,"Which one? The first one, second one, or the next one when this batch of hair inevitably leaves him?"
8350,"He uses it as an excuse for most of his ""jokes"" after he says something terrible on Twitter. That we just don't get him because he's autistic. Him and his stans imply you are ableist if you don't think his jokes are funny.  Fact is, he's just an asshole who also happens to be autistic."
8351,"You really must struggle with normal conversation, which is filled with missteps and sentence fragments.  One extra word typed and you are lost in the woods."
8352,"I don't like Elon. His jokes are disgusting and rapey vibes, you can tell he is off. I just disagree that what he tweeted is a rape threat, and that it is instead a nasty and inappropriate sex offer."
8353,"Agreed. I'll just say that Swift's and Musk's personalities are not entirely dissimilar. You wouldn't want to be Swift's boyfriend number forty-seven, but she's intelligent and she can play the publicity game better than Musk, and will probably write a song about it later."
8354,"I’m autistic and if a joke didn’t land, I think I’d prefer everyone pretend it didn’t happen then go out of their way to explain that I’m autistic so you can’t expect me to be funny."
8355,"Normal conversation is spoken. I have no problem with that. 

Written conversation needs to be spot on. Otherwise you come off looking a bit dumb, as you did before editing your comment. 

Proof read next time."
8356,For real?? “I will give you a child” is not an offer… it is a threat. An inappropriate offer would be “I could give you a child.” What is difficult to understand about this?
8357,">You wouldn't want to be Swift's boyfriend number forty-seven

Umm, I would...? She's cute, good looking and intelligent."
8358,"Eh… while the speed at which she burns through relationships is a yellow flag, I know people whose record isn’t actually that dissimilar, and it’s both the sort of thing that isn’t uncommon in celebrities and also can be outgrown.  People don’t take into account just how much of Taylor’s life has been in the public eye.

I’ve personally turned down the girl who had a new boyfriend every semester in school, but I don’t consider it a moral failing.  Maybe a bit of needing to learn to be single, but at worst that earns pity, not scorn.

But most importantly, Taylor, even in her most vindictive breakup songs doesn’t brag about some of the shit Elon has.  Elon’s vibe is such that I’m of the opinion that if he wasn’t “a divorce would buy me a nation” rich, women wouldn’t bother with him at all.  His kids largely want nothing to do with him, basically none of his baby mommas were willing to let him do it the old fashioned way, and he paid several of them to do it.

He’s got the same weird ass breeding kink as JD.  Seems to be operating off this “oh, it’s my job to spread my DNA as much as possible” thing, when the only advantage he seems to have actually inherited along his family line is financial."
8359,"Yeah, I kinda think that ridiculing Elon Musk because of his social media output would be somewhat nasty due to his obvious mental issues -- if he wasn't a billionaire with far too much power, and a clear drive to abuse that power.

I wouldn't do the same to autistic people in general."
8360,"ChatGPT said 

Elon Musk's comment about giving Taylor Swift a child, while certainly inappropriate and uncalled for, would generally not be classified as a rape threat in the legal or typical sense of the term. A rape threat typically involves explicit or implicit threats of non-consensual sexual violence. In this case, Musk's comment seems more like an inappropriate and objectifying remark, rather than an actual threat of sexual violence.

Soooo seems like you're the one not understanding. Give and gift are related words and you can decline the inappropriate disgusting twitter offer."
8361,"and rich. Don’t sign a pre-nuptial agreement and you’ll have it made. 

Good luck."
8362,"By all means, have a go. I do believe that the song Blank Space and the video for it, is Swift telling us who she is, and laughing at her audience, and exes. It's from ten years ago, and I think her personal history since proves the point."
8363,she really doesn’t burn though relationships. she’s been in multiple multi year relationships. the guy she broke up with last year was with her for 6 years. i never see this energy for young make stars who sleep around and date everyone in sight. it’s inaccurate and it’s weird. the media and they the gossips started being obnoxious about taylor’s dating life to make money off of her and probably to shame her for the natural age of dating as a young woman. so many people bought in. there are literal hate subreddits for her. they make shit up to fit their narrative. it’s all so so weird.
8364,"I put that number in the comment as a quip. It's one thing of many about her personality. It's not that difficult to see what she is, but I'll leave it at that, since this is off-topic in this context."
8365,ChatGPT is not very good at gleaning underlying meaning or context. Almost like it’s a shit thing to rely on in general.
8366,"> Good luck.

Yep. Take a look at Taylor's move on Scooter Brown. She basically took on the recording industry and won, with the help of several million genuinely fanatical fans. A mere ex husband would get steamrolled."
8367,"She spent 7 of those years in a monogamous relationship with the same person. And has only publicly dated two others since. 

I'm beyond curious what you think she did in the months between Blank Space and meeting her long term partner that ""tells us who she is""

No wait, I don't care."
8368,"Oh, that Peter or whatever dude who’s dated seemingly every single person in California is a red flag too."
8369,"I mean, I agree with it. Legally speaking, that tweet is  grounds for a sexual harassment lawsuit, but not a rape threat. For a rape threat to be established, there has to be an explicit threat of sexual violence. Saying “I will give you a child” doesn’t fit the legal definition of a rape threat because it can be interpreted as an offer to donate sperm. He would have to explicitly claim some form of nonconsensual penetration. Meanwhile, it does seem more fitting of a sexual harassment case because he could only have offered it knowing that she is a woman, so it fits the definition of an unwanted conduct based on sex/gender, and sexual harassment covers verbal conduct. Don’t get me wrong, Elon is an asshole and a half, but what you’re claiming wouldn’t hold any weight in a court of law."
8370,I understand but you're even less reliable.

Regarding immigration, if I go to the grocery store, the mall, park anywhere, I'm not seeing an increase in immigrants at all in Minnesota."
8374,The Center for Immigration studies is a right wing think tank that thinks immigrants are bad. Next!
8375,So people are now saying that Laura Loomer is directly funded by the FSB/Moscow. Is that right? Where is her money coming from? Why does she push the hate propaganda like she's getting paid to do it? What is she telling Trump?

8383,"Harris worked for 2 years 2020-2022 ish and worked with central and south american countries to resolve economic and at-home factors pushing immigrants north to our borders. With close work in many nations she ended up cutting illegal immigration by 50% over 2 years. She actually stopped the immigrants from coming by doing actual political leg work. The GOP would never do this. They killed the best border bill of our lifetimes. They don't want to fix anything. They want to scream about it and make dogwhistles that the cult will froth over. Same as the long-debunked ""caravans"" lies they used to use. Turned out they overused that one and the fake photoshopped pics were too stupid to believe even for the MAGA cult."

8402,"I think it's a pointless exercise..I have tried sharing facts to counter the lies and bullshit trump spouts on the conservative sub..and I get downvoted and well not listened to. The same thing will happen to you here. We do not want Trump back. The few of us who have some criticisms of Kamala will still vote for kamala cuz all things considered..trump is a bigger threat to democracy..obviously you won't agree which is fine.

8424,"Trump still has megastars Kid Rock, Ted Nugent, Rudy Guliani, and the Trump January 6th Choir. and of course Steve Bannon once he gets out of Prison.

MAGA 2028."
8425,The ONLY thing I’ll give Dump is that his toupee looks slightly better
8426,Even more reason to hate her
8427,"And the timing is just brilliant, beat him when he’s down"
8428,"“Nah, we have a quarterback’s wife. We got this..”"
8429,The impassioned “DAVID” makes me miss Schitt’s Creek
8430,This is actually sooner than her Biden endorsement in 2020 isn't it?
8431,"I suspect that the timing was well coordinated. Swift has one of the best media teams on the planet, and you can bet they liaised with Team Harris.

If Harris has performed poorly, a Swift endorsement would draw attention away from loss.

If Harris savagely beat Trump - which she did - then this is a huge exclamation point, and turns a good night into an overwhelmingly good night. 

They weren't going to waste a Swift endorsement on a meaningless Wednesday in mid-August. This has to be timed right."
8432,"It’s late but masterfully timed, I’m hoping it will crush the walking poster board for sociopathy and NPD’s ego "
8433,Late? Election is still 7 weeks away and voters have memory of a goldfish 
8434,"She wanted to sell music to both sides as long as possible.  That's not a surprise.  And now that Harris won the debate, it's not as much of a risk to back a winner.  You can't think Swift didn't have that photo and post all ready since a day after Vance made that stupid statement.  Taylor was waiting for the right moment to lean in."
8435,Don’t you think he looks *tired*?
8436,"https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/s/Srh0n4U54H

8440,Seethe
8441,He cares the most about the opinion of celebrities.
8442,Agreed!
8443,Yes.
8444,"I believe so. But given how late a start Vice President Harris had, I and a lot of other people I know were expecting an endorsement sooner."
8445,I have a good feeling it will. I grew up with my mom and sister and they are both huge Taylor swift fans. If there’s one thing I learned about her fans is that there’s a lot of them and you shouldn’t underestimate them lol 😂
8446,The timing for this one is pretty killer though - it's a one-two punch with the debate.

8448,"- the GOP nightmare is now complete. Demented Delusional Donald failing big in front of the American people and Taylor Swift coming in to deliver the final death blow to the GOP,,,you do not piss off the #1 performer in the world with 10s of millions of US voting age fans...."
8449,Taylor Swift kicking him while he’s down. You love to see it
8450,"I don’t care about her, but she has influence and it’s nice to see her get off the fence"
8451,280 million Instagram followers. The margin in 2016 Pennsylvania was 0.015% of that

8453,"I really despised that old video of her being talked out of supporting Democrats in the midterms by her dad and folks around her. It all felt performative. It made out like she was being super brave...when big celebrities endorse politicians all the time. 

The timing may be strategic, if so that's fine, but I don't love how she seems to withhold her approval of something she obviously personally supports and acts like it's a huge personal sacrifice by supporting a non fascist."
8454,"I mean she was always going to endorse Harris. 

I suspect she was waiting till absentee ballots/mail in voting were starting to be available in some states.  

It's far more effective for her to endorse Harris, and say people can go and vote for her today, then it would be to endorse Harris and then say people should vote in a few months."
8455,"I'm by no means a swiftie. I'm a mid 40 male. I don't really care for her music although it is catchy. I'm a big fan of her though..she just seems like a good soul and she does a lot for sick kids and local food shelters (she donates 10s of thousands to the local food shelters when she plays a gig in that city - and does it as silently as she can). 

She's smart. And she has a fucking huge fan base that trust her. This will be huge for Kamala."
8456,"I would say she was never going to endorse Trump, which isn’t the same.  She never has to endorse anyone."
8457,"Well yeah obviously she isn't required to endorse anyone. 

Historically she has endorsed the democratic candidate."
8458,"

8459,How latching on to a dumb term can derail your journalistic credibility
8460,"Guys, did you know that VP Harris is a Black woman and that some folks are sexist and racist in this country? Yeah, it's true."
8461,How 5 point leads for Harris are bad for Harris and Biden
8462,Clinton beat Drumpfuck by 3m votes.  People need to remember and be reminded of that.
8463,"Imagine being aware that you *shouldn’t* be obsessively foaming at the mouth at scary stories you make up about immigrants, but doing it anyway"
8464,"It’s possible I guess, but I think (or at least hope) that most people have moved beyond that kind of thing. The big surge she had in polling over the last month or so and the positive reception after the debate shows that people are liking her and viewing her as presidential. "
8465,"Yeah, and they said this in 2008 too. We'll see."
8466,Any observed social effect must be considered in terms of the population that it was observed on. The composition of the population in term of races is no longer the same now as when Bradley was running. Obama won in 2008. Hillary won the popular vote in 2016. Kamala will win this time.
8467,"In 2008, 16 years ago, Barack Hussein Obama annihilated John McCain — a white conservative male veteran who had been a prisoner of war. 

It’s like this author and others have collective amnesia. The primary issue to overcome is not identity. It’s a recent history of far left positions and an unflattering narrative of incompetence that was perpetuated throughout Harris’s vice presidency by her own party until she became the nominee. 

Why is this so difficult to understand? Harris will win the election if she continues to triangulate on issues like immigration by adopting Republican-lite stances. Sounds blunt but it’s the truth."
8468,How Erectile Dysfunction Derail Could Deflate Trump's Trip To Epstein Island
8469,"Unfortunately, this is a real thing. The other term for this is known as the [Bradley Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect)."
8470,Suddenly she's *Black*? When did that happen?
8471,*Indian
8472,"Folks, it’s Opposite Day. Here’s why this is looking bad for Kamala Harris"
8473,It’s disgusting the Electoral College still exists.
8474,"Indeed we will. Personally, I hope that Harris wins and defies the Bradley Effect, because the consequences will be really dire if she doesn't."
8475,So. Racism with extra steps.
8476,Mixed race people exist... you know that right? 
8477,"Is the concept of mixed race people beyond your comprehension is something? Is it really that difficult to get when ones parents are different ethnicities you are *both*? 


Harris has a black father, Obama had a white mother "
8478,"There has only ever been one demonstrable instance of the Bradley effect and it's been roundly disproven over and over since then.

This is a dated idea and TIME publishing it is embarrassing."
8479,Essentially. The idea is that social pressures against racism (Democrats had a concern about this in 2008) and misogyny (as may have been the case in 2016 with Clinton) can lead to polling being higher for non-white or non-male candidates than what the election numbers that come out are. It's similar to what is coined in Britain as the Shy Tory factor.
8480,They were clearly mocking Trump.
8481,"They’ve got 88, a common neonazi dog whistle in, their username. Just saying."
8482,"Her dad is mixed Jamaican. The Jamaican land also holds many people of Irish, Indian and English ancestry. Also, Jamaicans don’t consider themselves black but I don’t suspect you would know that.. bet you couldn’t tell me the difference between a “yardie” and a “coolie”"
8483,I don’t consider Obama “black” either so
8484,"To me, the fact that polls missed to an almost identical degree for both Clinton and Biden strongly counters that the Bradley effect was behind the polling miss on Clinton."
8485,Ah... sorry it's really hard to tell nowadays
8486,"How do I always miss that, wow I'm dumb."
8487,So you really are too dim to understand mixed race people noted
8488," I consider Obama white/mixed, just how you consider him black/mixed. What’s the difference. And what’s wrong w Kamala being Indian? I don’t have an issue w either"
8489,"He's literally both white/mixed abd Black/mixed since hus mother was white and his father from Kenya so he has both White and Black African heritage


 Harris mother is from India her father is from Jamaica you are the one trying to claim she's not if a certain heritage My dude


Again mixed race people are both their parents ethnicities at the same time equally its not thar hard"

8507,"Can they start making ""I have a concept of a plan"" shirts? I'd like to buy several of those."
8508,Was wondering when she was gonna endorse Kamala. Turns out it was great timing!
8509,"geez, no beats missed by this campaign… *pre-ordered*."
8510,"It almost feels like they knew Taylor was going to endorse Kamala and had this ready to go all along.

It also means the entire Harris/Walz campaign kept this quiet while the media and MAGA were talking shit. Must’ve felt great having that satisfaction in their back pocket.

Now we just have to wait for Beyoncé’s endorsement."
8511,[Bought one](https://store.kamalaharris.com/harris-walz-friendship-bracelets/)
8512,"Sorry, can someone ELI5 the friendship bracelets? It's a Taylor Swift thing?"
8513,"Yeah, now they just have to deliver them. I ordered my Harris merchandise weeks ago. Still haven’t gotten it. Lawn signs aren’t doing any good in the mail."
8514,"My jaw *dropped* when he said that. What kind of moronic job-hopeful says, ""I don't have the job yet, so I don't know what I'm going to do."""
8515,Plans begin at conception!
8516,"Give me a little bit to get home, I just got finished with the nightly feeding run (long story), and I'll see what I can do. Would you want something like an old school political poster, straight text, a political cartoon, or something different?"
8517,"“I have a concept of a plan, Arthur”"
8518,"We have a plan.

They have a concept of a plan.

That’s the t shirt."
8519,Better than NFTs 🤷‍♂️
8520,This has probably been a couple weeks in the making. An endorsement this big is likely not spontaneous
8521,Kind of did. Trump was told not to use her music.. Harris does.
8522,Sold out!
8523,"Yeah, it is, but also other communities use similar ones

It’s a subtle indicator the endorsement was all planned between the two of them"
8524,"Back in her 2022 album Midnights, in her song You're On Your Own Kid, there is a memorable line in the bridge ""So make the friendship bracelets.""

Then in 2023, Swifties had the idea of making friendship bracelets to exchange with fellow fans at the Eras Tour. The bracelets would be anything TS-related, originally just being about album and song titles, but eventually developing into lyrics, including acronyms of lyrics like YOTPWYGSU (yeah feel free to guess which song that is). It became a whole thing."
8525,It’s worse than that. He HAD the job and *still* doesn’t know.
8526,Nepo-baby president
8527,"I am doing informational interviews four months before I graduate. If the interviewers asked me “What do you plan to do for us?” and my response was “I have a concept of a plan”, they would end the interview on the spot."
8528,Swift didn't plan with them.  It was a fore gone conclusion she would endorse them.  Meanwhile its a picture and they are pre-order
8529,"Ok, so what dropped for middle aged dudes?"
8530,"> It’s a subtle indicator the endorsement was all planned between the two of them

Do you think that the Trump campaign apparatus didn't have a plethora of Trump, Swift, merch ready to go jic? This is nothing more than another sign of what is wrong with our election apparatus which has been turned into a money making horse race industry."
8531,Thank you!
8532,Good point.
8533,"He had the job and has had 9 years to develop the plan. Nope, still just out there brainstorming concepts.

Edit: Present me is ashamed of past me for not going with “brainfarting concepts.” It’d have been wittier."
8534,Use this line if **and only if** the interviewer is wearing a MAGA hat.
8535,Pretty sure it’s a digital mock-up too
8536,"This is for middle age dudes

You give it to your wife/girlfriend/daughter and they think you’re cool"
8537,"If the interviewer is wearing a MAGA hat, Imma jump out of the interview myself."
8538,Or you wear it yourself and they think you’re goofy but sweet.
8539,Fair enough 👍
8540,Or just give it to other dudes!

8559,Goddamn the timing of her campaign needs to be studied for years. 
8560,"As depressing as it is to say, this could be more impactful than Trump losing the debate."
8561,"THIS IS HUGE! My cousin’s wardrobe consists of at least one piece of TS merch per outfit. Swifties are the most powerful group known to ever exist. Ever. 

Also, I’ve talked a lot of shit because she’s a billionaire & I’m poor. I take it back. Thank you, Tay (hope it’s not too soon if I call you that)."
8562,And she plugged how to register. Never underestimate swifties.
8563,Pretty darn good statement by Taylor.
8564,Oh Taylor the woman you are
8565,She was swift with her endorsement
8566,It's over now. Swifties will vote in droves
8567,"“She stays up too late, she’s got nothing in her brain.”

8573,It's so Joever
8574,Oh yeah wow tyler swift is such an politic adept
8575,Gross that this matters.
8576,This will hurt Taylor more than it’ll help Harris
8577,Who cares lol
8578,I feel like this is bad timing. Trump just drooled all over himself on live television for 100+ minutes and it’ll be overshadowed by this
8579,Two separate things that are both impactful in different ways to different demos
8580,"After everything else, That’s your take away?"
8581,She endorsed Biden 4 years ago...
8582,"If Swift had endorsed Trump instead, would you say the same thing?"
8583,Suuuure…
8584,A shit ton of childless cat ladies.
8585,"You do, since you commented on it my guy."
8586,"Morons do, and let’s be honest that’s 50%+ of the country."
8587,"Disagree - this reinforces the narrative that Harris won the debate because it happened right after (the implication being Harris's performance was so good to convince Swift to endorse her -- obviously this isn't the case and was probably a planned move, but it still works). There are pundits who will still try to say Harris did poorly, but this endorsement provides evidence to the contrary."
8588,"It’s keeping the narrative 100% about Harris and her campaign. There’s no opportunity for any of the media to be like “wellll he did say he’d be a dictator but only for a day. So this is only partially true.”  It’s actually genius coordination between the campaign and her team. Generally I’m not a Swift fan but her image and PR teams play a whole other ball game and the Harris campaign team isn’t too far behind. 

It will drive him crazy that people have already forgotten about him and the debate. "
8589,"Nah, it'll ride right alongside it. There's not much you can do to overshadow his declarations that people are eating pets and kids are getting trans day-surgery at school...

Let's see....

First period, Homeroom.  
Second period, Gym  
Third period, stop by nurses office for gown, then head to OR2...  
5th period, Recovery  
6th period, don't forget lunch! It's charred cat on a stick today!  
7th and 8th period, skip out and buy new clothes to surprise parents with new gender reveal!"
8590,I agree wtf swift
8591,What take away do you think I should have? You think it is a good thing that mediocre singers that probably don't have a clue what is actually going on in politics hold so much political sway?
8592,"And her dad tried to talk her out of it. He wanted her to stay neutral. She said she had to let her fans know her feelings. I respect her more for standing up to her dad than endorsing Biden. She is smart, educated and knows the issues of the day."
8593,"No, that would hurt Taylor, but actually help trump. Kamala has just peaked"
8594,"This guy here also believes immigrants are eating our animals. 

Care to guess which party educated people are more likely to vote for? "
8595,"If you read twitter, they are saying it was rigged and the moderators were with Harris. The level of delusional has no end with this hardcore base"
8596,"I'm far from a Swiftie, but why do you think she doesn't have a clue? Because she's a (relatively) young woman? What does that say about you as a person?"
8597,Her saying this has done more for politics than anything you’ve ever done. Go be miserable somewhere else.
8598,"If we’re going low info voter I would listen to her over kid rock. There’s that, I guess."
8599,"Really? Just because she’s a successful recording artist that her fans love and respect, she doesn’t have a clue about politics? Wow are you misinformed. She’s not only talented, but extremely smart."
8600,"I’m wondering where the pet eating thing came from but not interested enough to search it out. (I’ve had the flu and haven’t been online in a couple days lol) 
 
But back to the subject , anyone who only votes a way because a celebrity endorses that person is a moron(period)

Now a celebrity can use that stardom to hype up a candidate bring in some attention from whatever age group/sub culture that follows them but that doesn’t mean “hey let me wait and see how this ONE person thinks before I also mimic it” thats fkn bonkers that’s just advertising ,any big name money grabber can be bought and sold and their endorsement means nothing. 

At this point in the election any endorsement means nothing, if anyone’s mind can be changed at this point because of what a celeb says then thats just sad. this election is a pretty simple choice unless you’re a greedy a-hole millionaire/billionaire (which many of those are) there is only one way to vote."
8601,How could she? She's a very busy women. She doesn't the time to do the real work it actually takes to be well informed on the complicated issues facing our country. Most people don't.
8602,I'd rather just inform low info voters so they can make their own decision for themselves.
8603,"No. I'm disgusted that people care about her political opinion BECAUSE she is a successful recording artist. There is no evidence whatsoever that she is well informed and qualified to make a fully formed assessment of what is best for this country's politics. The fact that people care how she votes, and will decide based on her endorsement, is an indictment to how terrible our political culture has become in this country. This isn't how people should decide how to vote."
8604,Did she tell them who to vote for? She told them to register and vote. Which is a message everyone should be spreading. You seem very upset about telling people to go out and vote for whoever aligns with your beliefs. 
8605,So no person outside of politics should be allowed to give their opinion on issues?
8606,Wouldn’t that be great!👍
8607,Where did I say she couldn't express her opinion? She can say whatever she wants. My problem is that it matters to so many people and will influence their vote.
8608,"She clearly held back for a long time, but she cited Trump's intellectual property abuse (illegally suggesting that she endorsed him) as a reason. This did not happen in a vacuum."

8610,Childless Cat Lady off the top rope with a metal chair!
8611,"Taylor Swift's cat Benjamin will have the last laugh.

Mark my words Vance and Trump."
8612,Please save democracy.
8613,Welcome to the team. Plenty of room in the tent for you and everyone you bring with you.
8614,"The heat is on! The heat is aw-on! 🎶
( I know that’s from Beverly Hills Cop, but it flew into my brain just now)"
8615,"It is about time. 

Now get your fans to register and show up to vote, like it is one of your concerts."
8616,Thank you Taylor!
8617,There are multiple posts already in Taylor Swift endorsing Kamala Harris. Should they not be put in a megathread?
8618,"I don't understand why anyone would care who she's voting for.

The woman is so out of touch with how the average person lives in America at this current time.. 

Like she's been effected by higher gas prices, a bigger grocery bill, or living in a situation where her rent is so high that she's unable to save the money for a down payment on a house. But even if she were able to, now she'd also be effected by an inflated mortgage and high interest? lol.

I'm sure she is taking a hit on her monthly jet fuel bill though, she might notice that."
8619,Childless cat lady delivered a coupe de grace right to trumps flabby chest
8620,Are you asking for Taylor Swift to save democracy?
8621,"Seriously, why the hell are people STILL posting this. We know. We all know."
8622,"> The woman is so out of touch with how the average person lives in America at this current time.


You can be rich and have empathy, believe in human rights and dignity, and know right from wrong. "
8623,Her fans care because many of them are completely obsessed with her
8624,"Wow, this is what it took to get Republicans to care about the environment!"
8625,"I agree mostly — I’m not personally interested in the thoughts of a billionaire who uses feminism as a convenient crutch to avoid criticism. But she has massive influence among young voters who are exactly who we need to turn out. So, welcome (back) to the tent, Taylor."
8626,"We should ask everybody that, so yes."
8627,"Crazy timeline, isn’t it?"
8628,Someone has to. It won’t come from the Republican side.
8629,Sounds a bit cultish
8630,"Nah, she's a resident of Tennessee, so her vote would be pretty meaningless.

Which is so stupid. Every vote should matter equally."
8631,"I agree, but I don't care."
8632,"No state is meaningless, Harris still need to win those EC votes to be President, the handful of swing states don’t get you to 270 by themselves.

So vote."
