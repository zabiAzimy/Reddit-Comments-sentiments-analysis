"Judge Merchan made a political decision.


Edit: and remember, Judge Chutkan recently ruled that the election is not relevant. Two very different perspectives."
"“He can’t keep getting away with this.”

- Jesse Pinkman"
"> “The public’s confidence in the integrity of our judicial system demands a sentencing hearing that is entirely focused on the verdict of the jury and the weighing of aggravating and mitigating factors free from distraction or distortion. The members of this jury served diligently on this case, and their verdict must be respected and addressed in a manner that is not diluted by the enormity of the upcoming presidential election. Likewise, if one is necessary, the Defendant has the right to a sentencing hearing that respects and protects his constitutional rights,” the judge wrote.

I’m sorry, the confidence in the integrity of the whatnow??

The fact that this MFer isn’t in jail _right now_ has pretty much locked in what the the public’s confidence levels regarding justice are like these days. This is just more of the same ole bullshit."
Two tier legal system gonna keep on trucking.
You and I would be in jail by now. Fuck him.
"This is utter bullshit.  Two tiered justice is full on display once again...

Our legal system has become complete trash from bottom to top"
"For fuck's sake! So Comey holding a televised press conference a couple weeks before the 2016 election to announce he's reopening an investigation into Clinton is fine, but sentencing a man convicted of crimes by a jury of his peers in a timely manner is ""too political""!?"
So our legal system is a farce and Trump won by threatening the Judges daughter.
"Ah yes, lets give the rich con man even more leeway and room to breath, im sure he deserves it, unlike all the other criminals that get exorbitantly worse trratment, fuck them, right?"
"**Justice delayed is justice denied.**

The American people have been betrayed by what America's legal system has become. As someone who would have been a third generation lawyer *had I not refused to lie for a living*, I am both deeply saddened and infuriated."
"So let me get this straight, if I commit a crime, get convicted of that crime, am awaiting sentencing but I have an important event coming up, such as getting my nails done, I can postpone sentencing until after that important event is completed and no additional important events are planned in my life?"
This is how dictators happen; apathic allowance.
"So we could have a POTUS under FELONY CONVICTION AND SENTENCING while serving as President. Doesn’t that pose an UNPRECEDENTED CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS?

Trump should drop out of the race and resolve his legal disputes before attempting to run for office."
Fuck these “judges” - bunch of corrupt traitors
"I greatly respect Judge Merchan for his overall handling of this case, but this was a cowardly decision.

I'm reminded of a quote...

“The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything.” – Albert Einstein"
"He lost in May, why does sentencing take 6 months? "
"From this article:

> “This is not a decision this Court makes lightly but it is the decision which in this Court’s view, best advances the interests of justice,” Judge Juan Merchan wrote in the decision handed down Friday.

To give a bit more detail, [this is from the AP:](https://apnews.com/article/trump-hush-money-sentencing-delay-postponed-election-be5a6fd3481055187543236c8dd3b045)

> Merchan wrote that he was postponing the sentencing “to avoid any appearance — however unwarranted — that the proceeding has been affected by or seeks to affect the approaching presidential election in which the Defendant is a candidate.”

> The Court is a fair, impartial, and apolitical institution,” he added."
Fucking unbelievable this guy. Never seen anyone with as much privilege as this guy. Its truly absurd
"If you commit crime, just run for president."
Imagine claiming your candidate is persecuted while the entire legal system is bending over backwards not to inconvenience him.
The judge doesn't realize that this 100% gives the impression that Trump is being treated differently than any other defendant ever would be.
"... Wow, they aren't even trying to hide corruption anymore,are they?"
This cockroach keeps getting away.
The judge is more worried about optics than justice. Time to step down. 
No justice system in the US. Only a class warfare system.
"It isn't really a hush money case. It's a campaign finance fraud case.

Others have said it before me. But it really should be noted.

It's not that paying hush money was illegal it's that using campaign money to do it and then making up lies to cover what the money went for is campaign finance fraud."
The shitbag was found guilty on every charge. Impose the sentence. The excuse that it might influence the election? WTF? Voters deserve to know one of candidates is convicted criminal and facing prison time. Maybe that’s really important?
"""President Trump believes anyone convicted of a crime should spend time behind bars.” 

The statement from Trump’s national press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, to The New York Times was in response to a new conviction of Jaime A. Davidson, whose sentence Trump commuted in 2021."
"Fuck my life.

“Let’s wait and see if he’s elected, so we can let him get away with it.”

What the fuck is even going on anymore. Justice is dead. This country is a fucking joke."
Gutless fucking cowards. I’m so sick of this shit.
the u.s. court system is a fucking joke.
"Merchan said the delay should help “avoid any appearance - however unwarranted - that the proceeding has been affected by or seeks to affect the approaching Presidential election in which the Defendant is a candidate.”


Delaying also affects the election, so what are we doing here?"
"Nobody is coming to help us. WE MUST DO IT OURSELVES. VOTE. Vote blue down the ballot.

"I wonder, if I ever get in legal trouble, would the court postpone my sentencing because I have an upcoming interview?"
"if you haven't registered yet, it's a good time to do it, registration deadlines are coming up. checking if your registration is up to date, is probably also a good idea.

"Delay delay delay delay delay delay, oh hey it's election time! How convenient!"
"So the judge is afraid of what happens if he sentences trump and then trump becomes president.

Coward, do your fucking job."
Our justice system really is a joke and needs to be completely overhauled.
The will of the people is once again denied. Why even waste the tax payers money to hold a sham trial if no true justice is done.
I’m so sick of our spineless “justice” system catering to the very people they are supposed to protect us from.
Trump always gets a free pass! Regular citizens would all be serving prison time by now but not the Teflon Coated Turd!
"Ironic how when he stated he was above the law and could shoot someone on 5th ave, it was one of the only honest statements he has ever made"
"So in other terms: Orange face carries on with his conspiracy theories and cries like a baby, and the adult in charge gives in so they don’t look like the bad guy. Got it"
Marchan has been bought too.
">Merchan said the delay should help ""avoid any appearance - however unwarranted - that the proceeding has been affected by or seeks to affect the approaching Presidential election in which the Defendant is a candidate

... he sad as he issued a ruling based entirely on the approaching Presidential election."
"Man. I hope if I ever end up in court, they handle me with such caring hands..."
"If the shoe was on the other foot the presidential candidate was Democrat, would this have made a difference?  absolutely not! Another coward Judge."
"The problem is that the GOP is doing everything possible to delay or deny the votes being counted and the election declared for Harris. They want to force a win through Congress or the SC.

I'm betting the judge will have to postpone it again. 

I can see where he's coming from, but this is not a good look, and it's going to get worse. 

*sigh* seeing that mofo report to prison is still somehow on my Xmas list 🎁🎄"
and the band played on...
This is election interference.
"Spineless cowards, what an embarrassment for our country."
This will not change until we’ve had enough.
Will anybody ever have the cajones to lock this criminal up?
Such bullshit. Anybody else would have been sentenced. “JuStIcE iS bLiNd”
#Justice delayed is justice denied.
they already had the kid who shot up the school in court within 24 hours man. I get they are different crimes but this is dumb
"We have now become a country run by cartels like Mexico. Merchan lives in fear, soon we all will live in fear. The courts and Congress cannot protect us from this terrorist organization."
"Dear American judicial system: 

There is NOTHING you can do that will ever satisfy the MAGA morons that you treated Trump fairly. 

So please stop twisting yourselves into pretzels to show him deference. 

Fuck little Donnie Two Scoops."
"""The delay is the second time Trump’s sentencing has been postponed in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling expanding presidential immunity in an unrelated federal criminal case against Trump in Washington, D.C.. The sentencing was originally scheduled for July 11, but Merchan granted a request by Trump's lawyers for extra time to try to convince him that the high court's July 1 immunity decision should result in the verdict being overturned and the indictment being dismissed.""

The intent was clearly there before he was in the oval office. And now he can just retroactively say the fraudulent payments he made to pay back Cohen for paying off stormy , *before* trump was in office, are Offical Acts? Give me a fucking break."
"Get Kamala elected, sort out the supreme court AND SEND HIS SENILE ASS TO JAIL!!!!!!!!!! This is beyond frustrating!!!!!!!"
"such complete BS.

just more proof just how un-principled america actually is.

this rapist is free.

still hasn't paid up, nor intends to.

meanwhile the average american would rot in jail 

under less than half the accusations he's still facing."
Justice delayed is justice denied!
Judge just crowned him king above other citizens. Shame on him without spine.
"> ""The Manhattan DA witch hunt against me has been postponed because everyone realizes that there was no case because I did nothing wrong. It’s a witch hunt. It’s an attack by my political opponents in Washington, D.C., and comrade Kamala Harris,"" he said. ""This case should be rightfully terminated immediately.""

JFC, after being given so many breaks, guy still has the nerve to complain that the judge has it out for him."
"In other words, the RNC has deposited a sufficiently large sum of money into the Judge's offshore bank account."
"Judge Merchan, you pussy."
"“The public’s confidence in the integrity of our judicial system demands a sentencing hearing that is entirely focused on the verdict of the jury and the weighing of aggravating and mitigating factors free from distraction or distortion”

Fuck Merchan. If he really believed this, he wouldn’t let the upcoming election affect his timeline and decisions. He needs to uphold the law. Period."
Merchan you useless fucking coward.  Just sentence his ass and let him whine about the immunity ruling afterwards since that ruling doesn't mean shit for something he did before he was elected.
Merchan is a fucking coward.
And you wondered why people created Lynch mobs
Voters have a right to know if a presidential candidate is going to be behind bars or not.
"Time to investigate the fuck out of this lowlife, activist judge and make them so uncomfortable and insecure they step down to alleviate the stress"
"Perfectly fine for the FBI to announce investigations into Clinton that wound up being nothing weeks before the election, but not fine to sentence someone who has already been found guilty of a crime.

The second of those would be too political?! Give me a break."
He's so special.  We must not hurt his feelings.
"This is some fucking bullshit! As President, Trump's incompetent handling of COVID was directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans, he blackmailed an entire country, endorsed racism, forced American businesses to close due to his stupid tariffs, profited from the Presidency, and committed too many other offenses to list, and yet the son of a bitch is *still* getting his ass kissed by our ""Justice"" system? Imagine if Obama had done even one of Trump's crimes. Do you think he would be treated like this? If you're rich, the American legal system is a friggin' joke and you can apparently do whatever you want. "
Vote like you know there is a two tier justice system.
"As long as I run for president, my crimes cannot be sentenced. Got it."
"We will never have justice in America if we allow Trump to break our laws, this makes it imperative that we support Kamala Harris.

Trump doesn't love America, he loves himself and he is abusing our judicial system to enrich himself. Billionaires are not above the law."
"In trump's own words, the courts are being very unfair to him. No other defendant is so many criminal cases have ever been treated as unfairly as he has. This is a disgrace. He should have been tried, convicted, sentenced and imprisoned a long, long time ago. Justice delayed is justice denied. Unfair."
This guy is in its own tier of justice where nothing will ever get him in trouble
"THE KARMA TRAIN IS PICKING UP SPEED! HE'LL GET WHAT'S COM.... oh, wait. No."
"Vote in November.

Encourage your friends to do the same."
Is this piece of shit ever going to face consequences ever in his pathetic crime filled life?
"The right likes to cry about the deep state and conspiracies, yet their guy proves constantly that he is in a special protected class unbound by our laws. That's real deep state shit."
Translation: let me see how the election goes before I make my decision
The rule of law is a myth and always has been
I hate him. Justice must be served. Stop giving that turd a free ride
FFS will this cunt ever be bagged and tagged!?
Corruption at it's finest.
"If we don't get rid of the electoral college, we're going to lose our democracy."
"This IS election interference. 

Its like in hockey when the ref doesn't call the penality."
"We're never going to be free of this orange shit bag, are we?"
"The judge justified it because they’re trying to uphold the integrity of the court, apparently: 

> The public’s confidence in the integrity of our judicial system demands…

The public has no confidence in the integrity of the legal system as long as people like Aileen Cannon, SCJ Alito, SCJ Thomas, and chief SCJ Roberts are around and leading the ship. The US judicial branch has become shamefully corrupt and unjust."
Fuck this judge. Sick and fucking tired of these assholes who are not doing their job.
"At this point now, it’s very clear that the American legal system will not put away criminals if they are rich.  This man has not committed one crime, he has not committed 2 or 3.  So what will it take???"
Got it… hunter guilty… orange man walks if he wins with all the states refusing to certify
"Its past his jail time, someone should just drop him of there allready."
How much time is [Hunter](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg5j9yn81go.amp) going to spend in jail  ??
"FFS!! ENOUGH ALREADY!!

Can we get this BS over with so the country can move on???"
Delayed for election integrity? The fact hes running is ruining our election integrity.
Expect him to lose the election and get out of the Country as fast as he can. I'm guessing Russia.
"There is a silver lining. If the sentence was to be a fine, there would be no reason for delay."
I fucking hate this guy. Like legit despise him. Rat fucker keeps getting away with everything he does. Yet I don’t pay a speeding ticket and I’ll be in jail. Fuck this guy and anyone who fondles his balls.
"I'm not sure what i think of this tbh.   on the one hand if he gets sentence and gets a fine and/or jail time, it would be fair, but he'll just start a long round of appeals and use it in the election to show what a martyr he is and how he's being persecuted.       On the other side any other person would have probably been locked up already in that white collar jail that Martha ended up in.    

It does just seem like the court system is a complete farce and cannot handle someone willing to throw money at it to fight a case...     Any normal person would have hung, draw & quartered by now."
"The,  “I don’t want it to look like political interference”, is horse shit. This is political interference.  There is no reason that they couldn’t sentence him and then temporarily suspend the sentence. This guy has had all the advantages his whole life, just another example of how our system favors the rich and powerful."
Time to check the judges bank accounts.
"Let that punk lose the election and while people are celebrating our first female president watch trump get sentenced, and have to face all those lawsuits. Will be wild!"
"You know that out of every dollar donated to trump, 75cents goes into his personal account, so he can pay people like that judge.."
It’s in the hand of the people now. If Americans vote against him and he looses I think he will be behind bars very quickly. On the other hand if he wins … well … then the USA is probably really finally turning into a corrupt shithole …
Justice delayed is justice denied.
That judge is a coward.
"America, laughing-stock of the world."
It’s ridiculous for Trump to claim that there’s a “witch hunt” for him when he is getting every possible legal break he can get considering the crimes he’s committed. Today’s decision is another example of his privileged status in a tiered justice system.
"This just reinforces the fact that we don't have a justice system. We have a legal system, and it's the best legal system that money can by."
"Why judge why?  Please provide a detailed review and educated writing of your position so the public can also inquire.  

You have a duty to us judge. Your duty is to us, not them."
"Please americans...dont vote for him, he is the biggest disgrace ever of your country, and for the world too"
"Black kid playing with a toy gun = get shot by the cops.

Rich old white rapist = Get away with literally everything while whining about being the most persecuted person ever."
The best Chance to actually see this goblin get jail time is to VOTE VOTE VOTE!
"The way he’s been bumbling this election campaign every step of the way, it’s probably for the best his sentencing is delayed. Being sentenced before could give him a fundraising boost."
"Just another reason to get out there and vote, to make sure we don’t have to deal with this man’s shit again."
"“So your sentencing is on Friday…oh…you’re rich? Well my apologies sir, we can delay it indefinitely.”"
"Meanwhile, there are people still in prison who have done less that are still waiting on trial date."
"So essentially, lose the election, go to jail. Will be amazing to watch him implode."
We’d have served half our sentences by this time… fuck this guy.
There was no Supreme Court ruling when he did the crimes. He broke the law. The retroactivity of the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling is an enormous problem.
Justice delayed is justice denied.
What the fuck. Any normal person would have been thrown in jail until sentencing and this Mango gets to walk free and continue to break laws?
BS. Does any judge have a set of balls when it comes to him.
TIL: Get Out Of Jail Free is a thing!.  all one needs to do to avoid sentencing for a crime is run for office.
Prob means he's not planning on giving him jail time.
MAGA wins again. Vote on November 5th like you want to convict him.
"So, anybody checking his finances?"
"Last I recall, I predicted it would be delayed from September to later. And has it not come true before our very eyes?

Cowards. Our justice system is full of spineless cowards. They deserve the chair for the obstruction of justice."
"Yep, there is no law in the USA. You reap what you all saw..."
I’m finding it’s not that hard to become a Justice- Supreme Court or not. You just gotta be dumb af and carry a thesaurus to burry your bs rulings in legalese
"That gives me the impression that if Trump loses the election he will be sentenced to jail.  

Probably just a few months."
Another get out of jail free card.
Well that's disappointing
"If Trump loses this election, he is going to spend the next four years in court."
you would think you would want this sorted before the election....
"Do you think you or I would be walking around right now?
No.
This is the two tier justice system in action.  Anyone else would be sentenced and in jail."
"I don’t have an issue with this decision. What the Judge is signaling is that if Trump loses, he is going to prison."
He who has money never suffers from wrong doings.
"People fooled themselves into thinking the courts would actually put Trump behind bars. He’s never going to jail. You would go to jail for just one of the things he did but powerful people in the United States are immune to justice. The law and the police exist to keep you away from people like him, not to “serve and protect” you, a faceless, nameless bag of meat to the wealthy. This is America."
He's never going to go to jail.
This judge should be tried for obstruction of justice
Honestly this could make it look worse if Kamala wins and then right after they jail the guy. Rip the bandaid off and get it over with
"These freaking people. They just refuse to hold him accountable. Why even prosecute him? They use every excuse in the book. It's not even worth it. We deserve every, single, we wre going to get. Cowards. He commits crimes. Gets convicted and you can't sentence him? Fuck all the way off."
What a pussy? That judge should be fired for not doing his duty. No wonder New York’s justice system is a joke. They won’t lock up the criminals. Justice system needs an overhaul.
"So he’s got a couple of months to shit his pants more, oh well but it will happen."
"Well, that's *slightly* suspicious."
America?? Wtf are you doing???
"In Uk, before BorisJohnson became our awful PM, he had a court decision delayed until after election. Never came up again."
This makes me  🤢 if all are equal under justice then what gives here ?
"He's still claiming its a witch hunt, but witches never got the kid glove treatment he's received. No criminal was ever treated better than he has been. We need to vote BLUE from top to bottom of the ticket to make sure he does the times he deserves."
These cowards are all scared of trump and the far right white supremacists
"I can tell you exactly why he actually did this.  He's going to decide the outcome of the sentencing based on if Trump wins or not.  If he loses, he'll jail him.  If he wins, it'll be a fine.   Because he is afraid, and because he doesn't think the US can stand having their president elect be in jail.  He said it was to avoid ""diluting the importance with the enormity of the election"".  Congratulations Judge, you've just done the dilution in the eyes of the people who believed in justice in the first place, and brought into question your objectivity as a judge, given you have in this statement admitted that you cannot be impartial with the election approaching.  Let me be clear, I now support his removal from the sentencing regardless of if a new judge would be able to do it before the election or not, his credibility given that statement is now suspect, as far as I am concerned.


On a more technical level, the 25th amendment is all you need to handle this.  Prison is a legally-imposed disability, no one should care about this, there's a plain and easy legal framework for if the president is in prison. "
This is how I know our legal system is completely broken
What’s that saying about Justice Delayed?
That judge doesn't want to end up in prison if Trump pulls out a win in November.
"WWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

?????????????????????????????

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

fuck"
"Judges interfering in the meting of justice can fuck right on off. 

Sick of this two sets of rules bullshit."
"Well you guys just guaranteed trump goes nuclear if he loses the election. The writers on this season of America are really pushing believability, but can’t deny they know how to ratchet up the tension."
"Hilarious that the only people in this country willing to enforce the law, stand up to Trump and hold him accountable have all been black women- Letitia James, Judge Chutkan, Fani Williams- while others give Trump infinite amount of chances and deference.

Says a lot about this so called legal system."
If I ever get arrested I'm going to file paperwork to be a presidential candidate. Judges hate this one simple trick to avoid jail for felony convictions.
Let's give this fucker another election loss and than the judge can send him to jail. Perfection.
"What crap. The man was convicted months ago. He should be in a jail cell. Bet if he was homeless and stole a loaf of bread, he would have served his time already. This rich asshole double standard has got to go."
November 6? Shouldn't have need to delay anything after that date.
"They want us to beat trump for them. Anything that happens to him must follow a decisive loss in this election. If his crimes take him down now there will forever be accusations of it being election I reference. 

He must lose. Then all forms of consequence will rain down on him."
"What a cowardice piece of shit. He's guilty. He's still committing crimes on tv. FUCKING SEND HIM TO JAIL. If we can't sentence him until then, REVOKE BAIL. 

He. 

Is.

Still 

Committing.

Crimes.

In

The

Open.

This judge deserves the absolute worst in life for this choice alone."
"It’s infuriating but the judge is being fairly shrewd. If he sentences him now, Trump fundraises off that and plays the martyr card. 

Cleaner to do after his loss in November. Harris has multiple paths to 270. Trump doesn’t."
I wonder if any other convicted felon can mark their sentencing as “tentative” on their calendar.
"They keep saying he's not above the law, and yet, they keep giving him preferential treatment."
"I'll have to remember the next time I'm due to be sentenced for a series of crimes to tell the judge that I'm in the running for an important job interview, and as such we should hold off on sentencing me until I know if I got it or not."
"Convicted of election interference, then slides on sentencing until after the next election.  WTF, mate?!"
"Russia already won in 2016. The outcome of this election doesn't even matter. Trump wins, nothing happens to him legally. Trump loses, SCOTUS decides he really is king of the united states and if anyone says anything different the MAGA death squads will just roam around killing people.

Any sort of legal action against SCOTUS or Trump or really anything will just be seen as 'treason' by Trump's fucking moronic cult.

Unless SCOTUS decides to be legitimate, which maybe has a 1/5 chance of happening."
"trump committed a felony, a crime was committed, and he was found guilty by a jury of his peers that he had changed multiple times to be in his favor. They still found him guilty with all the evidence. This is a gross miscarriage of justice by delaying his sentencing. This judge either has no spine or was paid off. trump is not above the law, but somehow, he keeps skating by. Our justice department is a fucking joke."
"Legitimate question.  Felons in Florida cannot vote until they've satisfied their sentencing.  Having already been convicted, but not yet sentenced; Can Trump legally vote?"
If I did half of the shit Donald was accused of I’d be in jail a dozen times over
"What I do not understand is how the SCOTUS ruling on Presidential immunity has anything to do with this case. He was not president at the time these events took place. He was convicted on all counts, by 12 jurors on both sides of the fence. There is zero reason to delay sentencing. 

Fuck our legal system and fuck our government for letting this continue. Fuck all these people in power that claim they are for the citizens of this country, they all seem to only be there for themselves.

(I doubt all politicians and government leaders are like this, but god damn this is frustrating at every turn with this clown.)"
"Holy sheep shit, this is pissing me off! What the hell is it gonna take to restore proper justice? A riot? Physical intervention? How far do they have to push it?"
"Justice is SUPPOSED to be blind. Blind to whether the defendant is rich, poor, black, white or a presidential candidate."
"This precedent makes me not want to care about being moral at all. If this prick gets this type of treatment, idc about being a good person and I’m sure that’s how a lot of people feel. 

F the rich. When we all start acting like them, the system fails."
"Justice delayed is justice denied. Trump was convicted by a jury of his peers, it's his job to rule on the sentencing. Instead he has kicked the can down the road multiple times."
".. in his stated attempt to not allow politics to affect his decision. 
I guess RUSH had it right all along."
I got confused when I saw the headline because I had heard of the Chutkan ruling today and assumed that's what they meant. Like damn they changed that fast!
"""In 2011, Merchan presided over the case of a New York Police Department sergeant, William Eiseman, who admitted to conducting illegal searches and then lying about his actions in court. Eiseman pleaded guilty to first-degree perjury and official misconduct, and Merchan sentenced him to 24 days in jail.""

So he's a slap-on-the-wrist kind of guy."
"Because Judge Chutkan has what my Dad called ""intestinal fortitude"", or what I call balls. More than Marchan, Bragg, and allllll the other MFers judges COMBINED!!"
Fucking coward.
Wouldn’t be the first time. Merchan made it abundantly clear during the trial that he didn’t want to be the first judge to throw a former president in prison after Trump violated his gag order 10+ times. Anybody who thought he was going to play it straight and impartially this time around were either not paying attention or are huffing copium.
That's because merchan allows people to get preferential treatment if you threaten his children.
No no no no no no no no no... He made the decision so that it WASN'T political! Didn't you read what he wrote?? /s
He can. And will.
"No you see, it is “the decision which in this Court’s view, best advances the interests of justice,”.  

These folks just say the opposite of their actions and pretend we believe."
"Honestly.. he wouldnt have if he had just not turned his head that one faithful day, and in one timeline he didn’t. I always wonder whats going on in that timeline."
"Ah! Well, nevertheless,"
But we all know how that story ends ;))
"So we aren't going to let the sentencing of one man be affected by the nationwide election, but we are going to let the election results (or sentencing of the nation) be affected by this guys court case because people now have to vote not knowing if he'll be in jail before inauguration. Makes sense"
"Holy fucking shit

I mean, i was sitting here thinking that his blatant, on-camera breaking of LAWS at Arlington, which he posted to his fucking social media account, was going to be cause for saying “this prick has no respect for the rule of law so let’s throw him in jail as fast as we can”. Instead they’re postponing. 

So now if he becomes president they won’t be able to book him.  If he loses, it’ll further his witch hunt narrative and his crazy fucking idiots are showing up at the capital again. 

This timeline is so fucked."
"""If one is necessary""

What, because if he wins he definitely gets away with it?   Just saying that out loud now are we as officials of the court?  What the fuck??"
I'm at a loss for words at that quote.
"What the fuck would you waiting till nov do?

Literally the only plausible reasoning is that if Trump wins the judge will say - well can’t charge a sitting president and then what?  throw out the sentencing because it will be past the statute of limitations then.   

The fuck is this.  This isn’t justice at all.  

Remember when we pretended presidents and the rich weren’t above the law. 

Meanwhile Comey drops unsubstantiated evidence of a non crime to the public a few weeks before the election.   

Now we have a convicted felon getting almost a year delay of sentencing - sentencing that doesn’t even require jail time.    Just charge him a fine like everyone expects you too - why would you delay doing that.   Sentencing doesn’t even affect the election at all - he’s already convicted.   And we all know he will get zero real jail time."
Isn't it absolutely crucial that the public knows whether a person running for president will be running the country from a jail cell if he wins?
"> “The public’s confidence in the integrity of our judicial system

The public is 100% confident that our judicial system has ZERO integrity and bullshit decisions like this are exactly why. Just further reinforcing the fact that if you're a rich white dude then the normal rules don't apply to you."
"Another pussy ass Judge that bends that thang over for the rich but has fucked the poors and middle class so much. 

Poors/Middle class gets months in jail for just missing a court date. Dude, talked shit about your daughter and you still didn't clap back. Judge is a pussy."
"Ah sorry guy, you didnt subscribe to the Justice Premium package (TM) so I am afraid it's off to jail to have your life completely fucked in the ass dry for smoking that doobie.

Nothing I can do guy."
"This means jail time. If this was before the election it would help Trump win. He would fundraise off it. This is a brilliant move because even if Trump wins, it's jail time. 

The document itself even said that it is simply so it doesn't look like it's trying to have an impact on the election one way or the other, because it absolutely would. 

Because it's jail time."
"Merchan wants to avoid the violent attacks that his family would face if Trump was put in jail before the election. It is a cowardly act, but I can't say I wouldn't do the same."
Juan Merchan just ripped the blindfold off of Lady Justice.
Thank everyone who stayed home in 2016.
"We'd be in jail many, many years ago."
"Honestly, Trump did everything possible to delay consequences for so long that I almost think you or I wouldn't be in jail because we had already finished our sentence."
"Shit, we'd be up for parole by now"
"As someone that has held a security clearance, it always bothers me thinking about how fucked I would have been if I did anything close to what he did with all those classified documents."
A few of us wouldn't even make it to the police station.
I would’ve been in jail from the start man no bail nothing
Yet every conservative says he's being bullied and having the law weaponized against him
Dude its been trash since jump.
"2.0 

Maddening…"
It wasn’t a couple of weeks. It was a couple of *days* before the election.
"I don't think this is main reason. This judge maybe doesn't want to play along Trump's narrative that he is politically persecuted. Even if he sentences him next week, it is virtually impossible that he could throw him into jail or even does a house arrest to deprive him going out for rally. Thus, early sentence won't bear any benefit. Let's face it- the reality is that Trump could only be held accountable after he is defeated in November. 

If you feel mad about it, vote, volunteer, and donate to defeat him first."
"He won when it came to avoiding it before the election, but the thing is that if he wins the election none of it will matter anyway. Like even if he was sentenced to prison before November, winning would supersede that. And he would do his corrupt meddling after the fact.

It was always going to be up to us. I mean yes having these taken care of ahead of the election is something the American people deserved and we had an overwhelmingly slow play on these indictments seemingly almost on purpose (but really just out of cowardice I think), but again even if Trump was in prison he could be elected. 

We need to vote blue and end this once and for all. Because there’s no way he’s getting elected in ‘28.  And hopefully once he’s no longer their hope for a new fucked up country then the system can pick his bones clean."
Sir the “laws and rules” you people keep talking about is only for the “poors”.
"Trump has really highlighted how distincly different the ""justice system"" performs for the average American vs wealthy Americans. I grew up thinking so highly of our various institutions and safeguards. As an adult, they're a complete joke. None of this works the way we were taught."
"Exactly this. It doesn't matter when he's put in jail, he has an army of dipshit supporters that's do dipshit stuff before or after the election. The people saying ""Oh, see the judge just wants to avoid threats or being political or whatever so waiting is smart so herp derp."" No, it's justice denied plain and simple."
Especially because Trump is old and he probably won't be around for much longer. I'd guess maybe 10-15 years if he's lucky. Another 2 month delay is a significant portion of his remaining time.
Just make sure to threaten the Judge's family and you're golden
"sure, if you're rich."
"What we tolerate, we promote."
"Coming soon to an America near you.

God help us if he wins, it'll be the Trump Dynasty, I wonder if Don Jr. or Baron will be the heir and inherit the throne?

Disgusting timeline we live in."
"> FEDERAL CONVICTION AND SENTENCING

state, not federal. There's a difference.



He can't pardon himself of a state crime."
Why even hold a trial if afraid to convict. After the election will be too late. I know a dozen people who think trump got declared innocent because there is no sentence
"Which means you need to re-evaluate this ""Respect"" for this judge as it appears everything done to earn said respect, was and is a facade."
The cowardice we saw today is nothing compared to what we will see if Trump is elected. Do we really think Merchan is going to give any kind of sentence to a President elect? I understand why he might not want to have been seen as “meddling” prior to an election but delaying to after the election only increases the risk. It is a rare day when I see courage in our politics.
"Let's just play this out for a second. You want to see him jailed, I want to see him jailed, we all want to see him jailed, that's true.

But he was most likely never going to be jailed for this crime because that's not a super common sentence for this crime. But let's say he is jailed prior to the election.

That would absolutely light a fire for MAGA turnout in the election. And it wouldn't necessarily sway independents Kamala's way either. As much as we all hate it, the MAGA disinformation campaign about this being a political hit job has somewhat worked, or at least planted the seed of doubt in independents that the whole legal process is above board.

So Trump wins despite his sentence and pardons himself. Is that justice served?

The reality is this is an extremely difficult and unprecedented situation for the judge and everyone else involved. Our ONLY way to serve justice is to beat him politically at the polls in November."
Bannon was sentenced to jail in October of *2022*.  He reported to jail July 1st ***2024***.
It is a political decision to delay it until after the election. Remember this was originally supposed to happen in July and then the judge delayed it until September. He already knew at that point it was going to be within a couple of months of the election too.
"""The Court is a fair, impartial, and apolitical institution,” he added.""

Sure as hell doesn't seem like it."
"This action completely proves that it’s not. Delaying this does not show you’re impartial, but the opposite."
"Either way it would impact the election. 

1. The sentencing is delayed, probably helping Trump in the election (we are here, because anything other than helping Trump is ""political"" to the courts); or 

2. The court proceeds with sentencing as it would with any other convicted felon, probably harming Trump.

Merchan took the coward's way out here, I don't see any other explanation. Either choice impacts the election. Only one choice - the choice he made - explicitly takes the election (which isn't in any way tied to the matter he's sentencing Trump on) into account. 

Merchan just demonstrated that if you're a powerful political figure running for election, you can threaten and attack: the jury, prosecutor, judge, and judge's family - all with zero repercussions, and the court will bend over backwards to help ensure your odds of winning aren't harmed by proceeding as they would with anyone else.

If I tried to delay sentencing for my 34 felony convictions because I had a big job interview coming up, I'd be laughed out of the courtroom."
">“to avoid any appearance — however unwarranted — that the proceeding has been affected by or seeks to affect the approaching presidential election in which the Defendant is a candidate.”

The squeaky wheel gets the grease.

Trump screams about how everything is election interference, and so everyone bends over backward to give him everything he wants in order to look ""unbiased.""

There was an apolitical option on the table, but Merchan was successfully bullied into choosing politics instead."
"This sounds completely reasonable on its face but we all know if he wins the election, this will all go away. I don't know what we can do at this point other than vote. I hope it's enough."
Was he unaware there was an election coming up when he scheduled it previously?  Fuck him.
Imagine saying you're an apolitical institution right after making a political ruling.
"And yet he whines, non-stop, about how unfairly he's been treated."
"IANAL but I would think that now any defense lawyer should just have their client register as a candidate in the next election. Then just follow Trump's lawyers playbook for delay and appeal, citing these prior cases as precedent, and scream election interference if not afforded the same privilege."
"It’s not just the impression, he’s objectively being treated differently to literally anyone else and for objectively political reasons. To describe it in any other way is factually wrong"
Teflon Don rides again.
Can we stop turning on the light so he runs? can’t we just bug bomb the house?
Most accurate description I've heard.
"if enough people threatened to cause absolute chaos, probably"
"In fact, with this, I’ve lost even more confidence in our judicial system."
I am starting my 2028 exploratory committee now to see what crimes I feel like committing
"The only thing I’ll say is ANY sentence judge M gives now would have people shouting “political hit job!!” 

By waiting until after the election, he could wrap off the bandaid and rake him over the coals.  If Trump loses the election.  Cuz it really doesn’t matter if he wins he will be immune from everything under the sun from now until eternity…. Based on our amazing “unbiased” Supreme Court…"
Trump absolutely has multiple paths to 270 and he is a slight favorite in many forecasts and betting odds
"Florida defers to the laws of the state where the felony happened. If you're allowed to vote there, you can vote in Florida."
">Justice delayed is justice denied

Look at Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein as examples of this. Both were accused for decades, investigated for years, trials pushed back or accelerated as a result of their statuses, and eventually when they did get pinched, they both managed to fumble the system on technicalities based on how their trials were handled.. not because they were deemed innocent or anything.    
  
  America is such a broken place."
The first one following the bullshit SCOTUS ruling made some sense. This is fucking stupid.
the same judge whose daughter was personally attacked by Trump online.  He must be getting threats or something to bow down like this.
"I've been becoming more partial to 

> Justice so slow it effectively doesn't exist

Mainly because of all those out of touch idiots that love ""The wheels of justice turn slowly, but grind exceedingly fine"", ignoring all the cases in the past century where things were delayed so long a lot of horrible people died free men on their 10th appeal."
“It’s his job to rule on the sentencing” full stop.  You’re right.
"Merchan also delayed the immunity hearing that would rule on dismissal, retrial or no change until after the election. Any of those actions could be construed as influencing the election. 

So Trump will retain his current status as a convicted felon on Nov 5th. The choice remains the felon or the prosecutor.

While I'd like to see Trump sentenced to some prison time, this case is actually the least consequential. Anyone who had the TV on during Jan 6th or saw the photos of boxes of government documents in a Mar-a-Lago bathroom should be aware of how poor a custodian of American democracy Trump has been and would be."
but he is allowing politics to affect his decision.
I’m sitting here thinking is this a Freewill reference or Limbaugh? Can’t be that dead idiot Rush.
Thank you for the RUSH reference!
Great song reference
He should be embarrassed.
"He’ll appeal all the way to the Supreme Court, it will take years, and will eventually walk away “cleared”."
"In that timeline, he becomes a martyr."
The election has already been interfered with by the courts. The SCOTUS immunity ruling was blatant interference and many consider it unsupported by any rational reading of the Constitution. Cannon improperly dismissed (based on a footnote by Thomas) the documents case which should have seen Trump detained pending trial as is the standard for anyone who steals classified documents.
"Y'know how Trump's Supreme Court picks overturned Roe v. Wade, pissing off millions of women and mobilizing them to vote against him ever since? Well, I'm satisfied that a distinct lack of prison sentence before the election will help a few window-lickers stay chill enough to sit this one out.

Could just be copium, but I gotta hold on to whatever there is!"
Court *cases*.  He has more than 1.
"That’s the thing. We do know. 

If he wins, he will never see justice. He will ruin this country more than he already has. 

If he loses, THEN he will go to jail since no one will need him or protect him anymore. 

The amount of blatant corruption in this country is insane."
">people now have to vote not knowing if he'll be in jail before inauguration.

Well that won't matter because the SCOTUS will step in and say that the president can't be held in prison during their term and that serving the sentence will have to be delayed 4 years."
Get angry. Then let that anger carry you through organization. The people allow these scumbags to have power. TIME TO GET ORGANIZED.

"I feel like the judge is between a rock and a hard place, cuz if he sentences before the election, Trump's team can appeal to scotus claiming New York is interfering with the election and they'll overturn the verdict.

They can't appeal until after sentencing.

He's still convicted though, and iirc that makes him ineligible to appear on some ballots, and he can't get the conviction thrown out before the election now."
"They probably think they had to in order to stop Trump from screaming how he was only sentencing him because of his daughter.  Trump will get back in, this is RBG all over again. 

I hate this time line 😒"
"The biggest thing I've learned over the past few years is that the people in positions of power in this country are absolute cowards. They have no problem puffing their chest out and making examples of people with no real recourse but the second they have to stand up to someone who can be an inconvenience to them they crumble and run away. 

Judges, politicians, members of the three letter orgs, media, journalists, the whole lot."
The death threats got to him. It’s how they operate…
"If the outcome is *no* jail time, that would also impact the election lol. Obviously we can't tell whether it's jail time."
"There is no chance that a President-Elect will ever do jail time.  Absolutely no chance.  I understand the intention here, but if he wins it all goes away."
"He’s made it this far avoiding any real punishment, seriously doubt he’d get any jail time if he wins lol"
"Wouldn't trump just pardon himself if he wins hence, avoiding jail time?"
"Not having him face the normal consequences of his action like other Americans IS HAVING AN IMPACT ON THE ELECTION.  Jesus christ.

  
Trump runs like a bull in a china shop through the legal system and none of these weak-willed assholes want to be the one to hold him accountable so he never is."
Prepare to keep being disappointed
"I feel like decreased risk to his family is a bonus but I think the primary reason is that this way, no one can make the claim that the sentencing is politically motivated. Its not cowardice, its better for the interests of Justice in This context. Is it shitty that the political landscape is so volatile and dangerous that we have to change sentencing timing in recognition of it? Yes. But I still think its the right call for this situation."
It's not like Merchan would have a hard time asking for help protecting himself and his family.  Everyone understands this threat. He's had months to prepare.
"Reality Winner stole 1 document proving Russians interfered. She was arrested, confined, convicted, and sent to prison in less than a year."
I think you may be right!
"Nah, because if it were you or I we'd be facing life in prison or even the death penalty. I mean, the guy literally committed high treason."
Most people don't get to hand pick the final word judges in their cases that can also just rewrite hundreds of years of law at will to effect the few cases they can't directly rule on.
"Literally his co-conspirator was tried, convicted, jailed, and released already."
"I held the lowest of possible security clearances, if I came across a single one of those files in a bathroom and chose to ignore and walk away, I would face harsher consequences than he has, simply for me knowingly allowing that document to remain uncontrolled."
"When I started working for the government they told me even the slightest appearance of any impropriety was totally unacceptable and get me fired and charged filed against me. 

That's the difference between the top and the bottom."
It's top of the list why I have no respect for that man.
Same man. Any normal person would probably never see sunlight again
Delusion at levels never seen.
Doesn't mean they believe it. They're like toddlers being caught red handed. They're simply lying. 
"Thing is, his people are going to believe he's being politically prosecuted regardless.  They already believe that and they will still believe that after a delay."
"This is no different than someone petitioning the judge to delay sentencing so that they can have a visa application processed to leave the country. Trump is asking for consequences to be delayed until he has the chance to escape them entirely. If you went to court and said ""please, judge, don't put me into prison until after I know whether I can go live with my uncle in Brazil"" they would book you into prison then and there for the flight risk."
">This judge maybe doesn't want to play along Trump's narrative that he is politically persecuted

This was exactly the judges reasoning. Which is insane because by moving this until after the election so as not to influence the election, he's influencing it anyway."
This is such a bullshit narrative. Stop pretending like giving Republicans ratfuckers hallpasses  is some sort of 5D chess when it's literally just giving them preferential treatment
I shouldn’t have to vote in order to sentence him based on guilty verdicts.
"Get out of here with that defeatist bullshit pretending to be pragmatism.  If a judge is making sentencing decisions that are taking into account the convicted felon’s “narrative”, the judge is inappropriately participating in politics.  An election should not be the “only” path to accountability in this country.  This judge absolutely can & should sentence an unrepentant a felon to prison time."
"No, the lesson to learn here is that threatening the judges kids is an effective tactic if the judge believes that you have the power to follow through on the threat."
It’s crazy cause that’s what we were told to do 4 years ago and it didn’t do much to get rid of him. At this point I’m starting to think magic crystals are the only thing that works.
">Let's face it- the reality is that Trump could only be held accountable after he is defeated in November. 

That's what we were all told 4 years ago."
I believe he is policitally *NOT* being sentenced.
So does that mean anyone who wants avoid sentencing can just sign up to run for president? Or is this just a special rule for Trump?
Trump will be on a plane to Russia by time he loses in November. We will not get any justice.
"I don't care what the judge wants. Wants and needs are words that should never be associated with a judges decision. Utter crap. Judge should never be allowed in a position in the judicial system again. 

We're getting real close to ""vote, volunteer, donate"" aren't enough. We're almost beyond that point."
"> to deprive him going out for rally. 

It's almost like the consequences of one's criminal actions sometimes have a negative effect on your personal life and professional ambitions. 

Trumps narrative should not at all factor into the dispensing of justice."
">it is virtually impossible that he could throw him into jail or even does a house arrest to deprive him going out for rally.

So what? Every person sentenced to prison has things they would rather be doing; things they feel it is imperative that they be allowed to continue doing instead of going to prison for the crimes for which they have been convicted. I have not seen a single explanation as to why Trump wanting to run for president should have any bearing on the carrying out of his sentence. If you don't want to serve the time DON'T DO THE CRIME!!!!"
">Even if he sentences him next week, it is virtually impossible that he could throw him into jail or even does a house arrest to deprive him going out for rally. Thus, early sentence won't bear any benefit. Let's face it- the reality is that Trump could only be held accountable after he is defeated in November.

Do you think it's more possible for the judge to put Trump in jail or under house arrest to deprive him of going out for briefings and events that are the responsibility of a President Elect?

In other words, I'm saying that if there's any chance that Trump wins in November (and there is), it would be better to at least try to enact consequences now before it's too late."
The whole case was about how his actions interfered with an election by withholding information from voter through illegal means. Withholding sentencing until after the election is a disgraceful way to end the case. The sentencing could sway voters the same way know he fucked and paid off a porn star could have. It’s bullshit
"I wanted to be an attorney when I was younger going to university. Many decades later and I no longer have any respect for the justice system. It is now a weapon for the wealthy to judicate however they want the plebs and get the protection they need against said pleb. 

Can't wait to hear Legal Eagle's take on this situation on Youtube."
"Fucking A. Everything we were taught to believe in is a lie. Everything. Im voting for Harris/Walz in November, but I have little faith anything will change. Im participating, but I just dont believe in it anymore. It hasnt proved otherwise yet."
Plain and goddamned simple. There is no denying anymore.
"This is important to remember. Can't do it to their face, it needs to be a credible, implied threat made outside the courtroom."

"But he CAN now order seal team six to assassinate the judge, according to the SC."
"Agreed, this erases everything else"
There's not much courage in the judicial system either.
"Here's the thing though: None of this matters. Judges are not political representatives, and should not bring politics into their court rooms or sentencing. He should have treated this case the same as any other person found guilty of multiple felonies. Delaying the sentencing is a political act, and ironically lends credence to Trump's claims. Also, any other person found guilty and having harassed the judge, jury, and DA throughout the trial would be serving jail time, but because of more politics from an apolitical representative of our government, we probably won't see that either."
Yup. Fucking disgusting.
What a fucking piece of shit
"man those elections always coming outta nowhere right, you never know when they will happen"
"Have to disagree. He is going to send trump to jail, that is the reason for the delay. mark my words. Sending him to jail now would cause absolute chaos."
"I think it's safe to say the cancer of obscene wealth in this nation is stage IV terminal at this point... It has officially metastasized into every conceivable nook and cranny of the American institution. 

Those who are not outright corrupted by it, are too bound by the fear of it to make any meaningful difference when the chips are down. The result is the same either way; the total and inevitable collapse of *we the people.*

All that's left is democracy's funeral procession. If it's not this election, it will be the next, or the one after that.

We work ourselves to the bone, for a dollar that's worth less and less, still reaching for that childhood promise of the American dream... But behind closed doors, we are all grown up now, and deep down we know there is no one coming to save us from ourselves.

We had a good run, America. Rest in peace."
"Merchan just demonstrated that if you're a powerful *Republican* running for election...

You can be goddamn sure that if he were a Democrat, neither his candidacy nor the election would be a consideration in the timing of sentencing."
You aren’t very imaginative.
"Broken? Nah. System’s working exactly as intended: One set of rules for the extremely wealthy, and then there’s a different set for everyone else. I hate it."
Weinstein is in prison though
In Cosby's case it was more the incompetence of two different DAs dealing with his case.  He didn't really get preferential treatment after it became public.
"I prefer a system where if the court fucks up you're let go instead of thrown in jail. The other way around would see a shit ton of people wrongfully incarcerated.

I do think they should have taken the money though."

"This is all so much bullshit though because the only reason it delayed this long is by design by his lawyers. They kept using whatever legal tools they had to delay, delay, delay. And when it's time to actually face the music they're like 'well it's too close to the election now'.

The only reason this wasn't done 3 years ago is by design."
"This is the correct, if unfortunate, take. If he fails to get elected you can also impose jail time. Doing that before the election will fuel the ""lawfare"" outrage and make the Scotus appeal ""stronger""."
He's not ineligible to appear on any ballots.  What kinda Reddit nonsense is this?
The SCOTUS can not over turn a verdict because a judge does sentencing for the crime during an election. That’s not how it works.
"Someone correct me if I’m wrong, but I’m almost certain he’s on every ballot. Colorado tried getting him tossed off of it, but of course SCOTUS got involved."
"They can absolutely appeal before sentencing, and Trump isn't ineligible on any ballot. Stop getting your info from TikTok. "
"Remember there is a second part to this.  There is the fact that we had the weird ruling from the US Supreme Court about immunity.  And that now needs to be reviewed before sentencing.  And the timeline is short enough that it is hard to deal with that, and the sentencing would have basically happened almost on Election Day.  

So there are a lot of good reasons.  We can blame the US Supreme Court for this delay as they waited as long as they could to announce their ruling thus putting the judge in this position."
"While true, its easy to believe that judge Merchan is one of those judges that *won't*  deliberately do something to help Trump.  And keeping to a timeline where he gives Trump a light or defered sentence just 6 or 7 weeks before the election would definitly work to Trump's advantage.

In this case it really is better to keep everyone, including Trump's supporters, guessing."

Can't pardon state crimes.

Plus, it’s from a state, not federal, so I don’t think he can pardon himself anyway."

And he's still going to say *this* is political persecution even with the delay.
"Exactly, I also think saying “we won’t be able to do anything” is a bullshit excuse. You can do whatever the fuck you need to. These judges need to stop worrying about public opinion and do their fucking jobs"
"Exactly. So what, politicians are immune to legal persecution because they cry politics? Very bad precedent they're setting"
This is a second delay no less.
100%. He's been treated way better than anyone else in his position would have been treated to the point where the Florida judge literally just through out a case for him for no reason and he has the Supreme Court running interference on the Jan 6 case for him as well.  And yet somehow he is apparently some poorly treated victim of the justice system. Give me a break.
"We can't tiptoe around the stupid with this. 

They can scream political persecution all they want. The fact of the matter is, Trump is a criminal.

"That's the whole point of ""justice is blind"" too. 

When the time comes for your number to be called, we're all sentenced the same.

Shit, what people are missing too is he could've sentenced Trump to jail time or house arrest effective post-election (self surrender after) if that's what he ""intends"" to do. And that would at least send a message that consequences are in motion.

This is clearly the cowardly Merchan kicking the can down the street and hoping he doesn't have to deal with it so he can slink back to whatever bullshit rulings he gives to normal people."
This is especially more effective if you already have a cult following of people that you know aren't mentally well and have an average of 6 guns per person.

There is if the defendant is poor. Then they suddenly find their balls.
I agree but also I live in a society where what is deemed palatable is determined by stinky-weasleteats soooooo
And if he wins? He never goes to jail and continues his empire of crime?
"Disagree all you want but a truly fair, impartial, and apolitical institution would never even consider an election as a reason to delay a ruling."
"So fucking what.

You commit a crime, you get sentenced, you go to fucking jail.

Unless you're Donald Fucking Trump apparently, then they bend over backwards to allow you to run for President again after you already tried to install yourself as a dictator.

This judge needs to be fucking sentenced himself, this is blatant two-tier justice bullshit."
Even if he sentenced Trump to jail the sentence would be stayed pending appeal.
"Arguably necessary chaos. Delaying sentencing on a conviction because the defendant is running for president is extremely dubious for a ""equal in the eyes of the law"" standpoint.

Its not Merchan's fault the bar is this low but he didn't need to lower further. It should not be the justice systems problem that republicans nominated a literal criminal for president."
"Absolute chaos is likely imminent at this point. 

Buckle up, shits about to get really weird."
The only chaos is that fact that a criminal is still running free. Get convicted of a crime? Go to jail. That's what prevents chaos.
"I really don’t believe it would cause any more chaos than trump and his team cause already. 

What this does do, though, is create the ‘permission structure’ for disinterested/disaffected voters who hear about all of his crimes and think “well if he’s committed so many crimes why isn’t he in jail?” to justify a vote for him. I don’t understand their logic at all, but I know at least a handful of these people IRL. They are low information voters that view the world through some sort of weird results-define-causation view such that trump being locked up would mean he I s guilty and dems weren’t lying about him. Him being out somehow means dems are lying about his criminality because otherwise he’d be locked up. It doesn’t make sense to me, but this action will likely help trump more than hurt him I think."
He's not going to send Trump to jail. There is no minimum jail sentence for the crimes he was convicted of here.
"I do not debate this, but in terms of objective justice being defined as protecting the innocent and punishing the guilty, the term broken system is still my preferred choice of wording. We deserve better and they deserve worse, for sure."
"Sorta. He was transferred from Rikers Island to Mohawk ~~Minimum~~ *Medium* Security Prison while he awaits to see if they can overturn his entire conviction. He's crawling toward freedom through the cracks in the system. Just wait.  
  
  Edit: Corrected Mohawk as Medium Security."
"If Kamala wins big, the SC can try to do that. We will probably see a massive uproar the likes that haven't been seen since the Civil War. I don't think Dems will just meekly allow the SC to do that, unlike in 2000. Biden might even consider engaging in some ""official acts of the president"" to ensure Harris takes office."
"> Supreme Court will steal the Presidency for him, like they did with Bush. 

Much like with Bush, they can only do that if the election rests on a tiny margin.

If Americans wanted to protect democracy, and cared enough to vote, keeping Trump out of power would be very easy."
"The election would have to be close for them to attempt a steal. Like 270-268 type close. Plus, he’s not president anymore, and could not do the job in 2020 when he was."
Haven’t the Dems had the White House 12 out of the last 16 years?
It went up to the SC last time and they ruled against Trump so idk.
House arrest will probably be it

I agree. Nothing is going to happen to him either way. We’ve been letting traitors off the hook since 1865.
"If he loses, he’s just going to commit more crimes and lead another insurrection, and practically beg to be arrested. There’s no reason to lose hope. Voting him out was always going to be our recourse. But if we succeed one last time, there’s no way he avoids justice for another four years. Jack Smith fucking hates this guy and absolutely wants him behind bars. So does Kamala."
"He’s a geriatric first time felon who hasn’t been accused of violent crimes.   He’s not getting jail time.  No one in this situation would get jail time.

"I have to agree with this. Right now DJT is rapidly heading to another loss.  If Merchan sentenced him now it would spark sympathy voting and DJT would prattle on and on about how unfair the courts were.  Merchan holding off is denying DJT an air supply with his voters.   

 We just gotta vote, try to change our friends' and neighbors' minds to vote for Harris.  Then all these cases become moot.  DJT will just be another selfish old rich white man facing justice.   


 Also the endless money dries up.  After the election PACs won't want to give their campaign donations to him anymore... his campaign spending will undoubtedly collapse because he's simultaneously burning through piles of cash and also not spending it on getting out campaign messages.  Where's it going??? Nobody knows! DJT will be in a completely different position of bargaining when his lawyers stop seeing paychecks. These endless frivolous appeals won't be freebies for him anymore.  "

Let’s just hope he doesn’t win and he has now power to stop it."
"We're talking about a guy avoiding sentencing just because he's a presidential *candidate*, and you think that an untested and unreasonably naive legal principle will be applied after the candidate gets voted in?

I believe Merchan thinks Dump will lose come Nov, as do I.


It frustrates me immensely that this fool is given another deal but I really do think it's because he's not getting slap on the wrist sentence.


Merchan has to either:


 **(a)** sentence him before the election with a harsh sentence (that he's absolutely earned) which runs the risk of galvanizing support/really making him the underdog, increasing his odds for victory + administering sentencing next to impossible + giving Dump motivation to *really go full authoritarian* if he gets back in the White House.


 **(b)** give him a slap on the wrist (which would truly be an injustice) that would just backup the assertion that the trials, convictions, etc were shams/witch hunts/blah blah blah; again, potentially increasing his odds for November


 **(c)** postpone the sentencing, let him to continue to crumble on his own as Harris and Walz rise, he loses the election, and then gets hit with the sentence he's earned, being able to do nothing about it. Or he wins but he still faces the same, rightful, heavy sentence and they can figure out the administration of sentencing from there.


Option (c) makes the most sense to me when laid out this way. Even if Merchan were to take option (a), the sentencing would still likely not go into effect until after the election and I think that has a higher chance of harming rather than helping."
"Deserve according to who? God? Morality? Justice?

All abstract concepts, nothing objective about them. What’s objective is that the person who takes power receives it. 

I’m not saying you’re wrong, I’m saying it’s pointless to think of justice that way. If we want the power back, we have to take it. 

And I’m not talking about violence, I’m talking about collective thinking. We need to come together and play the game right back at them, but we’re too busy being divided and unfocused. 

We’ll never get anything because we “deserve it”."
"Is it just me, it seems that the justice system for the rich and powerful is not the same as the justice system for the poor and working class.  Am I missing something ?"
"Honestly, that’s more prison time than most rapist will ever see. Not saying it’s justice, but it’s a lot better than most people got."
That POS is gonna get off.  So to speak.
He can invoke the insurrection act.
"We need the house and senate, too. It's the only way we'll be able to handle another SC attack on our elections."
"Even if it’s not a landslide, if Kamala is the winner there will be a serious revolt if SCOTUS tries that.  As bad as Bush was, he wasn’t a treasonous authoritarian imbecile.  It’s fucking bad enough that the EC gives Trump a massive advantage over the popular vote (which absolutely will be a landslide for Harris) to the point that the election could still conceivably be close (I really *really* hope that Texas surprises us and flips, even though I know the state legislature would probably challenge its own tallies).  If we win regardless of all that and SCOTUS hands the win to Trump instead there would be a literal lynch mob coming for every one of the fuckers who stood in the majority.  I’m not normally an advocate of violence but even I would think it was better than just meekly watching the new age brown shirts take over and start the violence anyway, but with state sanctioning and out of sight in government facilities initially."

That's makes sense. Im tired of this orange twat holding the country hostage.
I hate all this but I think you're hitting the nail on the head.
">I believe Merchan thinks Dump will lose come Nov, as do I.

Three things:

1. Polls in swing states are within the standard of error to get to 270 electoral votes.
2. MAGA has infiltrated election committees to not certify the vote. Trump has even made statements saying he doesn't need people to vote.
3. States have made it more difficult to register to vote. For example, AG Paxton in Texas has prevented counties from mailing voter registration forms. 

We have to vote and we have to vote in big numbers to ensure there is no doubt to whom has won this election. We can't stay home like people did in 2016. Do not delude yourself: there is still a high chance that Trump  wins in November."
"That all makes a lot more sense when broken out like you did but I still have no clue what sentencing would look like of a sitting president. What could they do? Imprison him while he’s president? Wait four years and then jail him? I truly do not understand what will happen. Can you help me understand? I’m being for real btw, not arguing or anything, I just want to know."
"All the more reason to go out and vote. If he loses the election, there’ll be nothing stopping Merchan from putting Diaper Dump behind bars for good."

“Don’t boo! Vote!”"
"> I’m in a blue state anyway 

It's still important to vote and show just how many millions of people are voting for not-Trump, as it helps move toward ditching the electoral college."
"See to me that just means it shouldn’t be allowed. At least in this capacity where we’re all running towards a deadline and no one has any answers. Is no one trying to work out the logistics? Like, is this really going to play out however it does and THEN they’re gonna try and figure out what to do? I feel like somebody should be trying to put a plan in place for the ‘what if’s’.. All of them."
"That one and “don’t count the lies, count the I’s” really stuck with me."
"As far as I know (I'm just a dude not a legal scholar in any way) there's nothing in the Constitution that really covers this scenario which is why it's uncharted territory. I have a feeling the way it would play out is that any sentence he receives would be effectively suspended while he is POTUS but that's just my guess.

Ideally Congress would pass a law saying convicted criminal can't be POTUS but Republicans will block any attempt and even if it passes its possible the Supreme Court could even overrule it. Per the Constitution the only requirements to be President are ""The president must be at least 35 years old, must be a natural-born U.S. citizen and must have lived in the U.S. for at least 14 years."""
">They also argued a Sept. 18 sentencing, about seven weeks before Election Day, would be election interference.

">In a four-page ruling, Hellerstein wrote that nothing about the high court's July 1 ruling affected his previous conclusion that hush money payments at issue in Trump’s case “were private, unofficial acts, outside the bounds of executive authority.”

"He says the president has every right to meddle in the elections (as he did in 2020), so if Biden is directing the DOJ to convict Trump, doesn't that mean Biden has every right to do so?

This is the maddening part.  He says exactly what he means but calls foul if someone tries to hold him to it.  It's like dealing with a rich, spoiled playground bully.  He will stop the game at any moment for any reason and declare "" I'm taking the ball and going home"".  Even if it isn't his ball!!!"
Massive W for the American public

"Then, he should be given his right to a speedy trial and sentencing be done immediately."
"The judge denied Trump’s request to transfer the case to federal court, citing a lack of “good cause” for the move.

Judge Hellerstein’s judgment followed Trump’s claims that the New York courts were biased against him and that his trial judge handled presidential immunity issues wrongly.

Hellerstein, on the other hand, denied the claims of bias, underlining that federal courts lack authority to hear complaints of bias in state courts. He suggested that such issues should be decided by state appellate courts.


On the issue of presidential immunity, Judge Hellerstein reaffirmed a previous decision that Trump’s payments to an adult film actress were personal and unconnected to his official duties as president. “Nothing in the Supreme Court’s opinion affects my previous conclusion that the hush money payments were private, unofficial acts, outside the bounds of executive authority,” he said.

Trump’s attempt to have his case moved to federal court was part of a larger strategy to fight the ongoing New York prosecution, which he argues is politically motivated and harmful to his 2024 presidential candidacy."

"Which is 2 days *before* the soonest Trump will be able to legally sell his shares of DJT, presuming it continues to trade at or above $12 a share.

If DJT falls below $12/share and stays there, he cannot legally sell his shares until Sept 25.

Of course he has 114,750,000 shares, so even selling at $10/share would net him over a billion dollars. Except...

If he attempts to sell all of his shares he **will** tank the price even more, so he's not going to get $10/share."

They argued about it being election interference when the original sentencing date was set before it was delayed to the current one.
"I feel like if this argument holds true, then the counter argument also must hold true: running for office this close to sentencing represents obstruction of justice."
It's just another confession.
"You know what, I agree.  It would be election interference.  We wouldn’t want that, so let’s slip you into this gap I have on Sept 5th.  Does that work for you, Tangerine Traitor?"

The work Jack Smith is doing to push other federal courts to review new indictments and compare their rulings with Cannon's to highlight that political motivation, is encouraging. 

I am not a lawyer, but its reassuring to know that there are a lot of mechanisms in the legal system, and across the different courts (who, by and large, are extremely qualified and non-partisan, and care about the law more than politics), to protect the American people from this kind of corruption.

Imagine some rich person (e.g. a Russian oligarch or Saudi Prince) wants to give Trump a billion dollar ""gift"" ... they can buy shares when Trump is selling.  Perhaps with the help of a [dark pool](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dark-pool.asp) it could be more easily coordinated.  (

from the dark pool link above

>*The primary advantage of dark pool trading is that institutional investors making large trades can do so without exposure while finding buyers and sellers. This prevents heavy price devaluation, which would otherwise occur. If it were public knowledge, for example, that an investment bank was trying to sell 500,000 shares of a security, the security would almost certainly have decreased in value by the time the bank found buyers for all of their shares.*"
Last I checked DJT stock was under $17 and continuing to fall. At this rate it may wind up just enough to cover the disgorgement ruling in his NY civil fraud case.
"Nah, that's for Christian Religious Reasons. They're good. Now your local restaurant that closes Monday and Tuesday to give staff a couple of days off, that's election interference and anti-capitalist!"
"It's real rich that they delay at every possible point they can, get SCOTUS to make a ruling on presidential immunity, delaying things even more and suddenly they cry election interference. Guys, GTFOSTFU and take your lumps."
Yeah their strategy all along has been to delay delay delay.   Same old playbook.
"And official act while he was still a private citizen running for office as well, not the president.

This case should have never been delayed on that common sense alone."
Didn't one of them write columns in the newspaper about paying hush money to a woman?
"He should have just declassified the payments with his mind, duh."
"Careful, the Supreme Court may rule that it was wrong that he had pay hush money if the first place because the founding fathers didn’t have to pay off their sex workers, then order Daniel’s to pay back the money with interest and damages done to Trumps image."
TBF I bet many of the founding fathers would be totally cool with it actually. Buncha horndogs lol. Looking at you Ben!
"""public"" is superfluous here."
"there's a lot of secondary and tertiary clown after this guy

whole republican party need a revamp to rid of cancers"
"Most will ultimately cry *""I didn't realize my client was manipulating me because of my christian faith.""* in a desperate attempt to keep their bar admission.

Boohoohoo."
We will all be disappointed in the sentencing. The dude deserves what his supporters erected at the capitol on j6 for all he's done but he's not getting any more than a few years probation.
"I had a stalker who accused me of stalking.  He was also crazy, and accused me of being crazy. He lied to me constantly, but accused me of lying. The only thing he didn’t accuse me of was burning his house down after he burned down mine.

He later hanged himself in a Motel 6."
"In this case that’s not it.  They’re just throwing everything out there for defenses in case anything sticks.  Throw out 200 complaints with a 1% chance of success and you have an 86.6% chance of one getting a hearing 4 weeks later, with a delay to push it another 2 months.  Do that at every stage if every trial and you stretch it out by years."
I’m pretty sure he’s on americas dick now (Florida)
"Or as my ex-wife told me when I brought up how her cheating blew up our kids life:  ""You two should be over that by now, seriously"""
Yep. Sovereign wealth fund has nearly a trillion dollars. Dumping a billion to DonOLD would barely register.
"> So lets say the saudi sovereign wealth fund wants to invest in DJT.

The Saudi sovereign wealth fund has tremendous power and influence around the world.  They could, and might have already propped up the valuation of DJT stock."
"That only depends on if the Saudis know without a shadow of a doubt that he's going to win. They may have for all intent and purposes lucked into living in the best spot ever to make money without trying but they aren't fools.

Tens of Millions spent on depreciating cars they leave at airports?

That just makes their other cars that more exclusive. 

But hundreds of millions spent on a asset they'll never come out at least even on? That's a hard bet to take even if the reward is outlandish."
"His electability has gone down considerably since the plan was arranged, so I’m curious whether there is any interest unless polling numbers jump. Foreign powers don’t want to give Trump money out of good will; they may be willing to give him money for future favors. 

Biden dropping hurt Trump on all fronts."
No limits on foreign investors might be a bug in the design of the system.
">  So lets say the saudi soverign wealth fund wants to invest in DJT. 

looking at the polls it would be a very bad investment."
"Do they even need to ""hide"" it any more after the supreme court ruled bribes were fine as long as they were after the favour?

^^^Whiletheyacceptedsaidbribesthemselves."
Don't get me started on the interference caused by girl scouts holding bake sales  outside polling places.
Common sense has been MIA for a while now...
If common sense ruled that absurd official acts ruling would never have come down to begin with.
Based on recent history I'm expecting nothing more than a strongly worded letter asking him to please stop.
I am just hoping for a heart attack or something during sentencing. We need to get to a point where we don't have to hear about this loser ever again.
"They can give him a gold ankle bracelet for all I care, just make sure there is a gag order with that probation and likely house arrest."
">We will all be disappointed in the sentencing

I think so as well.

Typically 1st time criminal offenders (which trump currently is) don't get jail time for nonviolent crimes. I'd be surprised if he served time for this."
Id love a total media ban
"> He later hanged himself in a Motel 6.

We can only hope."
We should be so lucky
is this real? Are there any local news articles about this? Was it national news?
Wen you have other people's money you can continually appeal. The appeals need to be limited. He was found guilty by a Jury of his peers and this was done BEFORE the 2016 Election so Trump has no immunity.
Good observation.
"How do you know this isnt a way to pay him back for services already rendered?  They arent buying an asset, they are paying a debt.  They (or people like them, russians, chinese, whomever) that Trump did favors for or sold intelligence to during his presidency.  Well the bill has come due, and this is the completely legal way to funnel the money to him without a trace."
You don’t understand the scale of the SWF. They can afford to spend a billion merely on the chance of getting a payout as good as the previous. It’s not even that hard to justify given that it worked out well for them the last time.
"""It's a feature, not a bug!"" - The people controlling it"
Can we put it on a milk carton?
"I realize that's probably all he's gonna get, but I'm not okay with it. Not for a second.

Throw him in regular prison just like anyone else would be. To hell with the two-tiered justice system. Nobody is above the law."
There are almost 50k suicides every year in the us. This would not make the news
"Yes, it’s unfortunately real."
"I think most people are of the mindset that letting Jared's   investment firm manage funds (not have) from the Saudi Wealth Fund was payment for services if such a thing happened. 

And if that is the case then my point is strengthened seeing as the Saudis will get that money back plus interest seeing as how well the investment firm has been doing these past few years."
When justice fails men take justice in their own hands. We've seen it countless times in history. Playing with kid gloves in this shit is foolish to the max. We all grew up with law and order and most of us take society and the goodness it produces in people for granted. When society fails our circles become very tiny. And we only protect what's in the circle.
"criminal stalking, burning down the victims' homes, wrapped up with a public space suicide. I think it *could* make the news"
"That’s Jared’s payment.   And if he got paid a ton, where is trumps payment?"
"Maybe it would make news locally, but nationally the news is saturated with awful shit Trump says and does."
"I think the common conspiracy theory is that Jared is the money man for the Saudi- Trump criminal conspiracy and that was the Saudis way of paying for all those Top Secret documents. 

And you'd include all of those bookings at Trump properties over the years to pump those numbers."
"It's true. His friends are raping kids and paying for it with Venmo. We had another mass shooting the first week of school, again, and all those monsters can think to do is insulate their wealthy cult members from paying a fair tax rate."
