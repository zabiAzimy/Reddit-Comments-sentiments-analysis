There is no Republican Party. It’s the Trump party.,negative
The Republican Party has not fundamentally changed. Just the veneer of civility has been removed.,positive
"Republicans, take note: this is what true patriotism is. Not faith to party, but faith to country",positive
"Why is it that so many people have a complete blindspot when it comes to Trump?

He is riddled with serious flaws.

No responsible parent would want their child to grow up to be as selfish and dishonest and nasty as Trump, and yet many good parents seem prepared to vote for him.

What was a black woman doing voting Republican?  🤯,neutral
No it isn't. Setmayer is a POS that embraced the hate and misery of the GOP until she was cut out of the grift. I'm glad she's supporting the right side of history... for once... but it's not as if she had a noble start and watched it decline. The party she willingly signed on to is the same one we have today. The exact same one.,positive
"It ""died"" long before the 2020 election. The GOP of 2020 was the same as it was when the Tea Party came along as a leopard eating the faces of the Republicans who embraced their enthusiasm.

And election denialism is a longstanding fantasy of the GOP. Trump didn't introduce it. And when he started making an issue of it, it was long before the 2020 election. He even claimed that cheating cost him the popular vote in 2016.",positive
"Better right too late than never, but the fact that the straw came AFTER the second election with Trump on the ticket means she’s a disgusting person with no sense of reason or decency. Fuck off. She’ll just fall for the next degenerate who hides the extremism better.",negative

Sad it took her this long to realize that…,negative
"I don't know what has taken so long but I've just come to the conclusion that this election is about old political values vs new political values.

The old political values of democracy and equal rights produced the most powerful country in the world - biggest economy, biggest military, most advanced technology, that has given it unmatched advantages - its currency is the world's currency, etc..

The new political values of autocracy and no equal rights takes the best autocratic views of Russia (with pointless elections), the isolationism of North Korea, a Saudi Arabian view of the woman's role (an d LGBT) in society. Its a blend of Russia, North Korea and Saudi Arabia that is their guiding light.     

Some GOP leaders are wise to this change and are joining forces with the Dems because they belong with believers in the old political values and not he new political values. What's frustrating is GOP voters who vote GOP out of habit, without realizing they are supporting the opposite of what they intended.",positive
The republicans party is extremist and embracing Nazi ideology.   It is the anti of everything America stands for.  Being an active participant in it is evil and so if just voting  to support it.,positive
"Nah, they are just more obvious about it",negative

sorry what? A poc supporting the GOP? Nah you sus. Just flipping parties to retain relevancy. Gonna be another kristen sinema,positive
GOP converted to the MAGA party a long time ago.  I'm glad to see more people becoming aware....better late than never.,positive
Great. Now we’ll have Trump’s Party and a Republican party. Jesus Christ this country will never get better.,positive
at this point the real Republicans should create a new party and we should update the current “Republican” party to Trumpies,positive

">and yet many good parents seem prepared to vote for him.

They aren't good parents. They are vindictive, racist, misogynist parents who were raised by vindictive, racist, misogynists parents and who are raising their kids to be vindictive, racist misogynists. 

They're selfish by nature. They do not have empathy. At most, they care about immediate family and no one else. Everyone else is an enemy to them who they believe could snap at any moment and attack them and their family.",negative
Because those 'responsible parents' are just as selfish and dishonest as Trump is. As long as he's willing to push others down to uplift them they'll look past all his sins.,negative
All these Republican pols want from Trump is his loyal base to be loyal to them as well. All his base needs is for Trump to continue to profess his hatred of immigrants forcefully.,positive
He targets the people they want hurt,negative
They view it as voting for the people he picks and preventing Democratic policies taking over. ,neutral
"Imagine you're not following politics every day. Most people don't. Politics is rather boring, people have stuff to do. They don't watch every Trump rally, don't follow his court cases, don't listen to his speeches. What do they know about him?

If you get your info from irregular consumption of media, you might even not know Trump is found liable for sexual assault and guilty of fraud, that he's promising ""a bloody story"" with deporting suspected illegal immigrants, that he promises to stop funding public schools, that he is barely able of coherent speech lately. Because media isn't reporting on all that. Even if that gets mentioned like once on CNN, or in NYT/WaPo, you blink and you miss it (compare that with Biden age issue, which they loudly trumpeted about every single day). Everybody in the media pretends Trump is sorta normal conservative politician with a few quirks. Every elected Republican affirms it, and never gets challenged on that.",negative
Leopards look cute before the face eating starts,positive
"Exactly. She knew what she was getting into.

I'm always glad to hear about people switching sides, but doesn't mean I have any respect for them. It's not like they started supporting Trump in the first place because they didn't know how bad he was. We all knew, we all saw. It was crystal clear even before he came down the escalator, surrounded by paid actors (or actors that were at least promised to be paid), ranting about mexican ""drug dealers"" and ""rapists.""

Once you cast the first vote for Trump you are forever a piece of shit.",positive
"Yep, since Truman there wasn't really a driving force behind the GOP. 

By the 80s the GOP is just a 'we don't like communists' party (with also a lot of racism), which is kinda dumb because Democrats were never that far left. Carter signed in airline deregulation in 78, you really think he is going to go communist? 

By Bush Jr the GOP is struggling with identity and latches onto the religious right. Now the MAGAs have basically taken over and filled the ideological vacuum.",negative
"Split the vote on the right, the fascists will never have power ever again. I’m for a GOP splinter party.",positive
"What happened to the party of John McCain, Sarah Palin, Dick Cheney, Mitt Romney, The Bush Family, and Bob Dole?  They've sure Kamalong way!",positive
Every accusation is a confession.,negative
"I had to familiarize myself with who that is, but yeah it certainly sounds like he fits the bill--thank you for pointing him out! 

I like how he describes the Republican talking points as ""rhetoric of unreality"". How accurate.",positive
"As long as he's willing to <say he will> push others down to uplift them they'll look past all his sins.

The Republicans are joining the DNC. The DNC (which already catered to conservatives) will mover further right with their involvement. So we’ll get Republican party 2.0 and Trump.,positive

"Could matter? It will.

Anybody who was politically aware during the Bush administration understands how remarkable Cheney’s endorsement is. I was a kid then, and even I see it.

It’s not about liking him, making him out to be a good guy now, rewriting his history, any of that. 

Dick Cheney is an awful man. He’s still the same guy. He was the architect behind a lot of his administration’s failures honestly. 

Regardless, he’s meeting the moment by aligning with us (we’re not aligning with him or together, we’ve all been right first, he’s meeting us on our side, this isn’t compromise) Cheney shockingly recognizes the dangers of a second Trump term and therefore has decided to endorse the Democratic nominee, how does that not matter? 

At worst, it could help move the needle for a particular bloc of senior citizen conservatives. At best, Dick Cheney of all people is saying the Democratic nominee should win. 

It’s not even a case of “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” that’s a stupid saying, it’s simply a case of a Republican Vice President aligning with our side.",negative

You can read his released statement. It's not with regards to policy (for the most part) but with regards to the democratic threat Trump presents.


This is correct. We don't need Republicans (especially ones like Dick) to wax on and off about Harris' policies. We need them to recognize that whatever policy disagreements they have with the Dem candidate, they still present themselves within a normal window of acceptable behavior whereas Trump does not. 


He's done things that go beyond the pale of mundane policy disagreements and it's important for Republicans to recognize that.


From what I've seen, the Republicans that have spoken out do not seem to be signaling an absolute need for Kamala to lean into their policy prescriptions, they accept she might not. Their coming to her where she's at as a contrast to Trump.


In the end I think this will have a normalizing effect towards Harris' more progressive agenda if she wins and she's an effective leader. They'll aline her success with their support.",positive

"You don't have to take Cheney at his word (I would go as far as saying you shouldn't ever take him at his word). Good for him for endorsing, but that's it. He isn't endorsing Harris because he feels Trump is over some internal evil threshold (it's *Dick Cheney*), he's doing it because he knows if Trump isn't stopped then Cheney's particular brand of also incredibly super-fucking-evil-but-sort-of-outwardly-polite conservatism is dead. He isn't voting with his conscience, he didn't see the light, he isn't doing the right thing for any good reasons, he has ulterior motives and is trying to make a savvy political play to ensure that people like him can continue to be as evil as he was into the near future. If Kissinger was alive and endorsed Harris, would you think he was doing it for some noble reasons for the good of the republic?

Cheney and Trump are both evil at a level where trying to rank them doesn't even matter. They are two of the absolute worst living Americans. The entire world is demonstrably worse, scores of people have died because of both of these ghouls. I don't think his endorsement is pulling Harris to the right or some sign that she's a secret neocon, I just think Dick Cheney is truly and utterly reprehensible, a ghoul on the same level as Trump, who I no way *at all* has good intentions with this.

Kamala was surging when she decided to be progressive, instead of the zionist Shapiro, she picked pro union Walz. Now she's doing the Hilary and Biden strategy of being center right and win over conservatives. This is why young people don't vote, there is little to gain and only the lesser of two evils.

The DNC is taking our votes for granted and if you try to apply pressure then you're considered pro-Trump.

Almost every single person he worked with when he was president is saying ""this guy is not fit for office"". Yet the right is like ""he's my guy! they're all just RINOs now!""  It's kind of terrifying how literally nothing can get through the right wing's propaganda bubble.",negative

It's kinda indicative of the perception of Democrats and Republicans in general. Democrats are always cleaning up their messes, and Republicans get huge amounts of praise for doing the bare minimum. 

A democrat is pro choice, it's par for the course. A Republican who is pro big corporation, wants to cut welfare programs, give tax cuts to the rich, and destroy the environment, but is also pro choice gets heralded as a token ""moderate"" (looking at you Larry Hogan). 

Unfortunately, we just exist in a time where we have to pick our battles and take whatever support we can get.

This is a misunderstanding of both European politics and European healthcare.  Firstly because many countries including Germany and Ireland do not in fact have free health insurance, and secondly because actual far right fascist and fascist-adjascent parties do exist in Europe and are frequently getting 15-35% of the vote these days.

The world political spectrum is not ""the US + Scandanavia"".  You don't get to pretend that Norway, France and Denmark represent the world average and that the US is therefore the outlier.

">*The Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing in America Agenda Will Support 293 Projects Across 33 States to Improve Hydroelectric Facilities, Increase Dam Safety, Mitigate Fish and Wildlife Impacts, and Increase Access to Affordable, Carbon-free Electricity*

>As part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing in America agenda, the Department of Energy (DOE) today announced the selection of 293 hydroelectric improvement projects across 33 states that will receive up to $430 million in incentive payments to upgrade hydropower facilities – in operation for an average of 79 years. Administered by the Grid Deployment Office (GDO) and funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Maintaining and Enhancing Hydroelectricity Incentives program will enhance dam safety, improve grid resilience at 215 facilities, and protect 6,000 existing jobs at hydropower facilities as well as contractors and vendors.  
...  
Hydropower currently accounts for nearly 27% of renewable electricity generation in the United States, as well as 93% of all utility-scale energy storage. However, the fleet is aging, with many facilities in need of repair and upgrades.  
...  
The Investing in America agenda supports capital improvements directly related to three main areas of hydropower: improving grid resilience, improving dam safety, and enabling environmental and recreational improvements to hydropower facilities. Within DOE’s portfolio and funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Maintaining and Enhancing Hydroelectricity Incentives are complemented by two additional hydroelectric incentives: the Hydroelectric Production Incentives, providing incentive payments to qualified hydroelectric facilities for electricity generated and sold and the Hydroelectric Efficiency Improvement Incentives, providing payments to increase power generation from the nation’s existing hydropower fleet.

The goals of the hydroelectric improvement projects:

>**Strengthen grid resilience at hydropower dams by:**  

>* Replacing or upgrading turbines and generators 
* Upgrading control systems 
* Upgrading cables and transformers 
* Upgrading penstocks, which transport water to the turbines   

>**Improve dam safety** by upgrading aging dam infrastructure and strengthening existing infrastructure against extreme weather events. The average number of years selected facilities have been in operation is 79 years. Specific examples of projects include:  

>* Upgrades to emergency spillways, which channel extra water during heavy rains 
* Concrete replacement to prevent water seepage through the dam 
* Water conveyance repairs to improve how the dam controls water movement 
* Upgrades to gates 
* Upgrades to prevent overtopping of dam walls 
* Erosion repair on the dam and surrounding areas 

>**Facilitate environmental and recreational improvements to hydropower infrastructure that will improve water conditions and expand surrounding habitat and passage for fish and other species**, and upgrade recreational facilities near dams. For example:  

>* Fish passage projects will install fish ladders or other equipment to enable fish and other aquatic species to pass through the dam and/or the turbine. Some projects will also improve or expand the wildlife habitat surrounding the dam.   
* Water quality projects will deploy special turbines that reduce the loss of oxygen in water as it runs through the turbine to generate electricity. Water quality projects might also improve aquatic habitats downstream of the dam, as well as benefit species of conservation concern or cultural significance to Indian Tribes.   
* Recreation projects will establish or maintain recreational facilities and opportunities near the dam, which might include expanding water access for boating; improving access for other recreational activities, such as kayaking and white-water rafting; and enhancing walking trails.

Full list of selections is located at the bottom of the press release. There will be a public webinar regarding the selections on Sept. 11 at 1-1:30pm ET. Statement from U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm:

>“As our earliest form of renewable energy generation, hydropower has reliably kept America running for almost 150 years—and the Biden-Harris Administration is ensuring these long-standing facilities can continue the steady flow of clean power,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “Today’s funding will expand and modernize our hydropower fleet, while protecting thousands of American jobs.”",positive

That thr polls aren't showing a complete stomp is already scary enough - a bad debate showing is going to be very panic inducing.


Hopefully come November we see a repeat of the poll disconnect that has been the case for the midterm and bielections since 2020. Would love a blue ocean so Dems have the power to fix a lot of the things that were obviously not sageguarded well enough / rely on tradition, decorum, and good faith ",negative

Given the amount of time she has though, it’s much easier to simply answer the question given to her and then go on the defensive within that time if he happens to go first.

"Unfortunately Trump is able to create zingers on the spot, and I think she'll try to take the high ground or get narky very quickly. The debate is not a debate, it's a match of wits and one liners. I'm not sure Harris has what it takes and she'll struggle. I'd love to be proved wrong but I have a bad feeling trump will conjure up one awkward question from out of nowhere leaving her completely flapping. It's the one thing he can do painfully well - leave someone pent up and feeling useless due to his barrage.

Biden only 'won' in 2020 when he was lucky enough to have trump just babbling and come up with a hilarious reaction. No one remembers what the actual discussion was about. No one remembers anything other than Reagan saying the quote about the experience versus young age switcheroo.

She needs to think like that annoying kid at the back of the class who's smart enough to piss off the teacher but also smart enough not to piss off their fellow ""classmates"" ie the audience. And she's too much of a grown up to take that low road.

She just has to do something memeable that isn't cringe. Basically everything Hillary didn't do. And she definitely needs to not laugh constantly and I have a feeling she's going to do that and end up looking both nervous and patronising. I'd love if she came across as deadpan, giving pauses before stating casually ""did anyone else hear him tell the truth once there because I sure as hell didn't"" whilst somehow making the comment seem spontaneous instead of carefully planned.

Walz would be better because everything I've just described is pretty much what it feels like being up against a rowdy group of teenagers. Be smart, cutting, witty, brash, and yet somehow also be the adult. It's hard as hell.",positive

"That’s a nice talking point. If only it were based on fact. Dems killed a good bill and the Senate came up with a shit bill right before the election. Said shit bill which they refused to have meetings with the Democrats to collaborate on.

The Democrat bill was smoke and mirrors, but it served to con liberals into believing that Trump is so powerful that he can control government from afar. Even if he would have pulled that off, it would be because it was a shit bill and would codify the inhumane practices that Democrats are utilizing to continue the Great Replacement.

I’ll happily pay higher prices for junk from China, if it means that I can pay lower prices for American made products and a stop to the inflation insanity of this administration.

Anyone with eyes can see that Harris either can’t do math or has a vendetta against the American economy.

No worries, though. This will all be over very soon. Maybe even tonight. 😃",positive
">Walz would be better because everything I've just described is pretty much what it feels like being up against a rowdy group of teenagers. 

I like Walz well enough, but I disagree on him being better. Watching clips of Kamala interrogating Kavanaugh and Barr during senate committee hearings makes me feel pretty confident about her ability to deal with bozos like Trump (and I'm sure she's dealt with all sorts of characters during her time as a prosecutor).",positive
But they do have judges enforcing order and making sure everyone takes their turn speaking.,positive
"That was funny but if people are voting off a single statement, then truthfully what’s even the point lol. Biden was also coherent and well spoken then. Trump sounds exactly the same, albeit I would say he’s not as zealous as he used to be but just as aggressive. The expectations on Harris shoulders are unbelievably high and having a one liner won’t move the votes needed.",positive
"I get your point, but do you honestly think that using Trump debate tactics is actually going to change anything? I would expect most people would want to separate themselves from their opponents. Sure it may feel good in the moment, but saying Reddit catchphrases is odd in reality.",positive
"The point is to put it on display. The point is to make him melt down so publicly that apathetic voters reconsider participating, and trumpists stay home in embarrassment. 

He is neither articulate, witty or clever. When's the last time he even had something not Biden-related that made anyone have any reaction besides ""ewww wtf?"" Same evil, but the packaging has been sitting under the limelight for too long, and the shit filling is leaking out for all to see.",positive

">*16 Selected Rural Electric Cooperatives for New ERA Program, Including First Award to Dairyland that will Result in Lower Energy Costs and Good-Paying Jobs for Rural Americans*

>Sept. 5, 2024 – During a visit to Wisconsin today, President Joe Biden and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack will announce more than $7.3 billion in financing for rural electric cooperatives to build clean energy for rural communities across the country through the Empowering Rural America (New ERA) program. Together, New ERA and other investments in rural clean energy in the President’s Inflation Reduction Act make up the largest investment in rural electrification since President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Rural Electrification Act into law in 1936 as part of the New Deal.

>Collectively, the 16 selections announced today – funded by President Biden’s Investing in America agenda – will leverage private investments of more than $29 billion to build more than 10 gigawatts of clean energy for rural communities across the country. The selectees announced today will reduce and avoid at least 43.7 million tons of greenhouse gases annually, equivalent to removing more than 10 million cars off the road every year.  
...  
These projects will create good-paying jobs, lower energy costs for rural communities, significantly reduce pollution, enhance the resiliency of the nation’s electric grid, and advance the Biden-Harris Administration’s Justice40 Initiative. The 16 selectees will use New ERA funds to:

>* Deliver cleaner, more affordable and more resilient electricity to approximately 5 million households across 23 states, representing 20% of the nation’s rural households, farms, businesses and schools. The states served by this set of selectees include Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
* Support more than 4,500 permanent jobs and 16,000 construction jobs.
* Reduce pollution by 2.9 billion tons over the lifetime of the projects, or more than 43.7 million tons of greenhouse gases annually, equivalent to removing more than 10 million gasoline-powered cars off the road.
* Build or purchase over 10 gigawatts of clean energy – including 3,723 megawatts of wind, 4,733 megawatts of solar, 804 megawatts of nuclear and 357 megawatts of hydropower – and make enabling investments in transmission, substation upgrades, and distributed energy resource management software, lowering energy costs for rural Americans and enhancing grid resiliency, all of which will help meet growing electricity demand and power President Biden’s manufacturing renaissance.
* Build 1,892 megawatt hours of battery storage, which increases grid reliability and significantly reduces outage times for local customers.

>...
  

List of recipient for this latest round of funding is in the press release, more information can be found in a link about half-way through. Statement from Secretary Vilsack:

>“Under the Biden-Harris Administration, we are supporting a more prosperous future for rural communities by speeding up the transition to clean energy while at the same time keeping monthly bills low and investing in the American workforce with new jobs and apprenticeships,” said Secretary Vilsack. “One in five rural Americans will benefit from these clean energy investments, thanks to partnerships with rural electric cooperatives like Dairyland. Put simply, this is rural power, for rural America.”",positive

"A gauge of economic misery that has a strong track record of predicting elections is tilting toward a Kamala Harris victory — but it appears tight entering the race’s final stretch.

The [“misery index”](https://www.cnbc.com/2011/06/17/how-miserable-index-says-the-worst-in-28-years.html) is the addition of the unemployment rate to the annualized inflation rate in the U.S. It has correctly predicted 15 of the past 16 races for the White House, including every presidential matchup since 1980, according to an analysis by research firm Strategas.

This index now sits at 7.02, below the level that Strategas has found would be consistent with the incumbent party losing the election. That number accounts for the [modest decline of the jobless rate](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/06/jobs-report-august-2024.html) for August to 4.2%, as seen in Friday’s jobs report.

Below a 7.353 level is needed in October for the incumbent party — in this case, the Harris-led Democrats — to come out on top, according to Strategas. The firm found this level through exclusive analysis of where the misery index would need to sit for the party currently in office to retain power, based on history.

In other words, a reading below that threshold essentially means voters are not “miserable” enough when it comes to the economy to boot the sitting party.

">The U.S. Department of Education (Department) today announced more than $28 million in new awards in the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program to recruit, prepare, develop, and retain a strong, effective, and diverse educator workforce for classrooms across the country.

>The Department also released new data showing the breakdown of borrowers approved for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) in every state. The data showcase how every state has borrowers, including educators, that are part of the $69.2 billion for nearly 947,000 borrowers that have seen relief through this program. By contrast, at the start of this Administration only 7,000 had been approved for PSLF.  
...  
This announcement comes as Secretary Cardona is embarking on his 2024 Back to School Bus Tour with stops in Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. This year’s theme, ""Fighting for Public Education,"" highlights how school communities are using the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic investments in public education to implement evidence-based, promising, and innovative strategies and accelerate academic success and support students of all ages and backgrounds. The 2024 Bus Tour is celebrating public education as the American system that opened the door for so many of our nation’s success stories: from astronauts to astrophysicists, writers to engineers, musicians to mathematicians, innovative entrepreneurs in the private sector to great leaders in the public sector.

Regarding the grants:

>**Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) grants**

>To support efforts to recruit, prepare, develop, and retain a strong educator workforce, the Department is awarding $28 million in 18 new TQP grants. The TQP program funds teacher preparation programs in high-need communities at colleges and universities for the undergraduate, “fifth-year” level, and for teaching residency programs for individuals new to teaching with strong academic and professional backgrounds. The central feature of all TQP grantees is a strong partnership between the teacher preparation program and the school districts they serve, which is often facilitated by mentor teachers that coach and prepare incoming educators. In addition, numerous awardees responded to an invitational priority, focused on the establishment of Grow Your Own (GYO) and registered apprenticeship programs for teachers. These programs encourage members of the community – from high school students to paraprofessionals and other career changers - to pursue teaching careers while also enhancing educator diversity, reflecting the Department’s interest in learning from applicants proposing GYO projects.

>The Biden-Harris Administration has increased annual funding for this program by 34 percent, or nearly $18 million per year. At the same time, the Department has worked with States and the U.S. Department of Labor to grow the number that have approved registered apprenticeship programs for teachers, from 0 in 2021 to 38 States, D.C., and Puerto Rico today, and, in total, hundreds of millions in Department funds have been invested in Grow Your Own programs.

Regarding the PSLF:

>**State-by-State PSLF**

>The new PSLF data shows the breakdown of borrowers approved for PSLF by state following additional PSLF discharges announced in July 2024. The approvals contained in the data are representative of the Administration’s unceasing efforts to fix the broken student loan system and restore the promise of forgiveness programs. The Administration has helped fix longstanding problems with PSLF through the limited PSLF waiver, while the payment count adjustment has also ensured that borrowers get accurate counts of progress toward forgiveness. Additionally, Congressional districts across the country have been approved for $87 million in relief.  Outside of the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, the Congressional districts with the largest number of borrowers who have been approved for debt relief are New York’s 20th, Maryland’s 5th, Virginia’s 8th, New York’s 25th, and Florida’s 2nd district.

>In addition to fixes to the PSLF Program, such as the limited PSLF waiver, the Biden-Harris Administration has also implemented long-term improvements to PSLF to make it easier for borrowers to participate in the program. As of July 1, 2024, the PSLF Program is now fully managed by the Department through StudentAid.gov, rather than by a single, specialty loan servicer. That means that, for the first time, borrowers can manage all aspects of their PSLF journey on StudentAid.gov, including submitting their PSLF form and tracking their progress toward forgiveness. These updates will simplify the process for borrowers and allow for faster processing of PSLF forms. These improvements have been in the works since day one of the Administration as part of the Department’s efforts to overhaul loan servicing and implement significant improvements to all of its loan forgiveness programs, including PSLF.

Regarding borrower assistance:

>**An unparalleled track record of borrower assistance**

>The Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic steps to reduce the burden of student debt and ensure that student loans are not a barrier to educational and economic opportunity for students and families. The Administration secured a $900 increase to the maximum Pell Grant—the largest increase in a decade —and finalized new rules to help protect borrowers from career programs that leave graduates with unaffordable debts or insufficient earnings. The Administration continues its work to issue debt relief regulations under the Higher Education Act, with regulations expected this fall.

>In addition to the relief under PSLF, the Biden-Harris Administration has also approved: 

>* $51 billion for more than 1 million borrowers through administrative adjustments to income-driven repayment payment counts. These adjustments have brought borrowers closer to forgiveness and addressed longstanding concerns with the misuse of forbearance by loan servicers.
* $28.7 billion for more than 1.6 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements. 
* $16.2 billion for more than 571,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability. 
* $5.5 billion for 414,000 borrowers through the SAVE Plan.     

List of recipients for this latest round of funding is in the press release. Statement from U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona:

>“Nothing matters more in public education than making sure every child has access to great teachers, and that means well-prepared, well-supported, well-compensated, and fully empowered teachers,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Today’s announcement is the result of the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to making record investments in teacher residency programs, Grow-Your-Own programs, teacher apprenticeship and other comprehensive, high-quality, locally-driven, evidence-based educator preparation initiatives. If we want to Raise the Bar for our students and create an educator workforce that reflects the beautiful diversity of this country, we must expand and support new pathways into the teaching profession.”",positive

1. Trump made a deal (or well one of his cronies did, maybe Kushner or some other idiot.  Who knows), releasing 5,000 Taliban prisoners in exchange for essentially nothing.  This blind-sided the Afghan government and even our own military.  Then, leading up to the transfer of power, Trump did his best to leave Afghanistan a complete mess to make Biden look bad.  Honestly, Trump left such a disaster there that it's a miracle we managed to evacuate so many people and that more Americans didn't die.  If Trump or any other Republican brings up Afghanistan, remind the American people that it was their fault at the end of the day.  

2. Most importantly, staying there after getting Bin Laden was a complete waste of time and money (and most importantly, American lives).  In 2011, the Afghan government was still unbelievably corrupt and incompetent and the Afghan National Army was more or less useless.  This is after 10 years and billions of dollars in assistance.  It was clear then that any more time or resources spent in Afghanistan would have been a waste.  We should have pulled out sometime during Obama's 2nd term and brought back anyone who risked their lives to help us.

The Taliban could easily meet the don’t back terrorists attack on the US or its allies since the only viable terrorist group in Afghanistan was ISIS-K who is a Taliban enemy.  Al-Qaeda fled to Pakistan in 2001 so they nave negligible presence though some members joined ISIS-K.  Another clause in the agreement was don’t attack Americans which was easy to meet since Americans were only at the US embassy, one army base, and one Air Force base.  The Taliban could conquer 99.9% of the country without getting anywhere near Americans.  The third major demand on the Taliban was negotiate with the government which since negotiations are just meeting a few times a month and talking that was another absurd item.

"1. The taliban would have never agreed to alter it because they got exactly what they wanted

2. So let’s say you want to ignore the deal, saying fuck it to the taliban and the UN, well the wheels had already been set so far in motion by that point. So seriously, what would have been the options when prisoners were already released, troops and infrastructure had already been drawn down significantly (the contract notes not only the full pullback time, but an immediate set of actions that had to be completed conveniently before the end of 2020) and control of the country was slipping - not to mention the afghan government was already kneecapped by the deal in the first place

It’s a real question. Theres no new deal to be had. So they either had to try and finish pulling out minimizing damage as much as possible or they would have needed to *send more people and resources* back to Afghanistan with a worse position than when they were pulled out to try and regain more control to then pull back out again.

It was a nightmare situation. I’m not sure how the latter option could be justified - and by that stage the timeline of the deal wasn’t the important part necessarily, it was trying to get people out quickly because stability was gone. 

Not commenting on how the final stage was executed, but to act like they could have just cut a new deal and had no problems seems to ignore the total context",negative

"People aren’t saying the final evacuation was perfect.

People are trying to explain to you, with the timeline of events and evidence, that *before* the final stage the withdrawal had been pushed so far downstream before Biden had control that there wasn’t a meaningful way to slow things down. A powder keg had been created. 

Put another way, a withdrawal like this isn’t linear. Things were already destabilized, and the risks were accelerating so there wasn’t a way to delay. They needed to accelerate plans further by that point.

People can acknowledge that *and* look at the execution of the final evacuations. But the main problem is not people forgetting to look at the final step, it’s the massive number of people who ignore all that led up to it. 

It was a deal basically perfectly designed to create a mess and a situation where the taliban could pull something like that off once support levels were low enough",positive

I mean, it was batshit crazy to vote for this guy back then, but at least I can see that people who weren't paying attention would go wrong.

But now? Fucking now!?

It makes me feel like I'm taking crazy pills because what in the actual fuck, America? After all the damage that he did the first time around, how in the...

I could write about this all night, but I'm preaching to the choir and I know you know what I mean. So, I'll resist the urge to write an entire series of books on this. I just absolutely NEED to tell someone that I'm FUCKING TERRIFIED.  And I'm not so confident that Kamala is going to do as well as a lot of us have assumed. There are legit arguments that it may not go as well as we would think it would. Trump isn't beholden to the truth and if people that are STILL undecided haven't figured that out yet, then this debate will be a battle of soundbites. I still think she will very much outperform him, but will these people be able to tell? If they can't tell already, then I can't possibly imagine the mind of someone like that.

Sorry. But if you read all that, just know that I appreciate the shit out of you for doing so. I needed to let that out.",negative

"People don't generally look back at 2012 as a close election but Sept-Oct was as close as we're currently seeing. Take a look at the toss up states that year and how the polling averages moved. Colorado, Iowa, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio, New Hampshire, & Wisconsin.

In National polls Obama generally led by 1-4 points in Sept and trailed most of Oct. He went into election night with less than a 1 point aggregate lead in national polling.

Obama's ground game was amazing and he outperformed polling nearly everywhere. Dems even kept a Senate seat in a deep red state that everyone was predicting they'd lose (North Dakota). Hoping we see a similar type of election this year.",positive

Gas was more affordable during Trumps term. Trump kept USA out of major wars. War is expensive & affects gas prices greatly. 

Or we could use the real estate market as an example. 

Take the price of the average home in your state, and divide it by the average household income. Compare that number now to what it was in 2017/2018.

Statistically, the average American simply had more buying power during Trumps term as opposed to Biden/Kamala term.

"So you can't illustrate which of his policies will lower inflation and return American buying power? Got it. Heard and noted.

I do not think Americans have greater buying power, no. That would defy common economic reality to even suggest that, so not sure why you're assuming that.

So, we're giving credit to Trump 'keeping us out of major wars' while escalating military strikes significantly over his predecessor? Or are we ignoring his escalations because there was no 'name banner' war? I never get a straight answer about this. One of his policies calls for increased military spending, anyhow.

As for the real estate market, I was reviewing Trump's Agenda 47. I don't see him providing any policy proposals for addressing the housing crisis. Can you elaborate how you think he will address this crisis? Again, you can keep pointing to stuff, but you're very obviously dodging pointing out which of Trump's policies specifically are going to make a difference.

Once again, acknowledging the challenges with inflation (but also promising trends with wage growth), can you point to substantive policies during Trump's Presidency or his current proposals that will tackle inflation, the housing market, and sure I guess gas prices.",negative

">Today [September 5th], the Department of Commerce and NOAA recommended more than $23 million in funding to support marine debris removal and interception efforts for 13 multi-year projects across 10 coastal U.S. states, three territories and the District of Columbia. This funding is provided by NOAA’s Climate-Ready Coasts initiative under the Biden-Harris Administration’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law as part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda. 

>The Climate-Ready Coasts initiative is focused on creating climate solutions by storing carbon; building resilience to coastal hazards such as extreme weather events, pollution and marine debris; restoring coastal habitats; building the capacity of coastal  communities; and supporting community-driven restoration.  
...  
Following a competitive merit review process, NOAA recommended projects from two opportunities, which focused either on large marine debris removal or the installation, monitoring and maintenance of interception technologies that capture marine debris at or close to the source. Recommended awardees are targeting the largest and most damaging debris to provide tangible benefits to coastal and marine habitats, communities and economies across the nation.  
...  
Nine of the 13 projects are concentrated on the removal and disposal of large marine debris, such as abandoned and derelict vessels and fishing gear. The remaining four projects are centered on deploying proven interception technologies to capture trash, including plastic bottles, food wrappers and other persistent debris from urban environments before it enters the nation’s waterways. All selected projects are anticipated to advance equity and deliver benefits in tribal and other coastal communities facing environmental and climate challenges.  
...

List of recipients for this latest round founding is in the press release. Statement from U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo:

>“The Biden-Harris Administration is funding critical projects like these that will help remove and address harmful marine debris that can significantly impact water quality, habitats and economic prosperity in coastal communities across the nation,” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “These investments, made possible thanks to President Biden’s historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, will help improve coastal communities for decades to come by making sure they have the necessary resources to protect their ecosystems and local economies from the impacts of marine debris, which are exacerbated by climate change.”

Trump likes to attack and it causes his opponents to spend time defending and getting off topic and it’s a tactic he uses so he doesn’t have to answer any questions at all. It happened with Biden and he got a pass.

"> Fox News has been bleating about lack of policies for about 6 weeks now.

They loved that attack even though it was BLUNTLY OBVIOUS to everyone who honestly discusses politics that because of her rushed ascent to the top of the ticket, she hadn't yet consolidated her policy positions, and she didn't want to simply copy-paste Biden's.  

So she spent her first week of the campaign solidifying her nomination and avoiding a civil war in the party.  Then spent her next week reviewing VP packets and selecting Walz, then strategizing how he'll be best utilized. Then the two of them had to prepare for the DNC, a week long event.  Then they could finally ""slow down"" a bit and post her policies in the lead up to the debate.  All while doing campaign events all over the country.  

I doubt Harris or Walz have even had their feet touch the ground for weeks and they're still doing so much and the right is stupidly whining about things that even Trump can't manage, like clear policy proposals.  The fucking idiot can't stay on topic and his policy is just whatever Project 2025 says it is, and then whatever weird curveballs Trump throws in like the ""government fully covering IVF"", not because he even knows how it works, but because he's grasping at anything.

"The problem is that gun ownership is a constitutionally protected right which you can't legislate to the same degree as a privilege like say driving a car where you can put a lot more barriers before people can exercise that right.  There are multiple SCOTUS level decisions that state that the 2a is not dependent upon service in a militia, is an individual right, applies to weapons that did not exist when the 2a was written and that it is unconstitutional to ban an entire class of guns that is in common legal use and even that it specifically protects weapons suitable for use in a militia or military.

That creates a very difficult framework within which to craft the type of legislation like banning assault weapons because they are protected by the 2a without actually amending the constitution to change the 2a.  It effectively relegates regulation to trying to ban or regulate accessories and the process to obtain guns in the first place.  At the best right now with the SCOTUS rulings we have you could try to put ""assault weapons"" onto the NFA with full autos, SBRs, SBSs and suppressors but in a country where universal background checks are like Sisyphus pushing a boulder that seems like aiming lower is more realistic.

Fix the Background check system where states and even the military branches are not reporting all the criminal and mental health data to the FBI and NICS background check system so people can go to a different state and maybe pass a background check when they should fail.  Tie federal funds for law enforcement directly to how much data each state reports to the NICS so that way they can't bitch about the system failing because it will have failed because they failed it and they can't bitch about lacking funds because their reporting the necessary data is what dictates the amount of funds they get.  Heller said it was unconstitutional to **MANDATE** guns be locked in a safe but people will almost certainly lock their guns up if you make buying a gun safe something they can deduct from their taxes and gun safes being several hundred dollars sometimes that tax deduction can be a good incentive.  Same thing with like gun safety training classes make those a tax deduction.  Right there you make accidental and negligent discharges less likely you make safely storing guns a bit more accessible without the ""Big brother is telling you how to live"" vibe and you get background checks that actually work and don't let people slip through the cracks at least as easily as they do now.  I would also say that there should be an increased allocation of federal funds to investigate and prosecute people caught lying on the 4473 background check form to buy a gun, an act which as we have seen with Hunter Biden is a felony and happens to be one where the criminal **LITERALLY SIGNS A CONFESSION TO THEIR CRIME** when they sign the form they lied on and are caught doing it.  That isn't even low hanging fruit that shit is laying on the ground almost throwing itself into fruit baskets.  Those people who fail background checks probably are not giving up on getting guns when that happens and if we arrested and prosecuted them we would probably see a drop in various forms of gun related crimes.

Do that first and you appease the ""Enforce the laws we have"" folks without triggering them to action with a ban of some kind, you fix background checks by making the more accurate which makes it easier to justify making them universal, you make safe storage easier and more affordable and you likely cut down on accidental and negligent deaths.  Hopefully in all that you cut down on mass shootings and then we can move forward from there.  Focus specific solutions towards specific types of gun problems instead of trying to form some fix all solution like just ""Ban X"" and that'll do it.

"Just because I'm right, and polls are starting to show this, is what is making you upset. What should be a run away election for Harris is turning into another nail biter because she refuses to push populist progressive policies that was exciting everyone when Walz was selected as VP.

Now that excitement is dying down since. Especially with her release of her right wing Democratic policies that excite no one except her ride or die, blue no matter who, supporters. I'm putting out my opinion that she needs to cut out this shit and get back to what was exciting voters instead of supporting fracking and Republican immigration policy. 

- 1 month ago she was +4 (NYT), +3 (Q-PAC, F & M) in PA
- Today she is now TIED (CBS, CNN) with Trump in PA.

People like you who think she needs to stick to the center or move further right instead of hammering home popular policies is what is the problem. And when she loses running on these garbage policies, which I do not hope, you will be the first to blame people like me who were trying to ring the warning bells.

Here's hoping she dunks on Trump tomorrow and gets a huge bump that lasts. That's the only real way I see her getting a victory right now. Absolutely embarrassing Trump in the same fashion Biden was embarrassed and had to drop out. You know, which excited everyone.",positive

Wat? Are you assuming I'm not voting or something? You clearly aren't reading my posts then.

I disagree. I believe these polls are showing the more she looks further right than even Biden, the less interest and trust they have in her to actually enact change that will affect their lives. 

>your sort of pushy, progressive ideology is absolutely toxic for the left.

I think holding elective representatives to a higher standard is required if you want real change. Placating them and licking their boots will only allow them to continue moving further right. 

I'm not asking for crazy things. These things exist in other governments so we know they are possible. I'm asking for things that have a +60% approval rating across the board with the American electorate. It's sad you think that's a losing strategy.

Let’s not get complacent. Register to vote. 

Register now, not at the pols. Also check your registration status weekly from here until Election Day. Especially if you live in Arizona, Georgia, Texas or any of the other swing states or Republican controlled states. Go to vote.org. 

Go back to the site regularly to recheck your status. 

Then vote. Vote early in the day so you don’t get shut out. Take the day off from work if you have to. It’s that important. If you can do mail in then do it as soon as possible and then follow up to insure that your vote was received and most important accepted/certified. 

In the meantime talk to that mother, father, aunt, uncle, bil, etc and show them what Trump will do to their lives. Put together a coherent written list of trump lies and deceptions that trump has used in his speeches and show your loved ones the deceptions along with the sources. If you only bring one person over then it’s worth it. every single vote counts!

Project 2025 can be downloaded in PDF format. Just Google it. It’s a massive 900 page document that looks like it came out of the book 1984. Scary as hell. Highlight the sections that will resonate with your loved ones so they will know how this cult will impact their lives. 

Talk to friends and make sure that they are registered and will be voting. On Election Day find out if anyone you know needs a ride to the pols. And give them one. Democracy in action.

It will be VERY, VERY CLOSE unless there's a big swing one direction or the other in the next two months.",positive

There were so many god damn things that were going to be 'devasting' to Cheeto Jesus that it's a foregone conclusion it won't be. The Arlington Cemetry fiasco alone would have killed any candidate in a sane country but of course it came and went like every other bad thing he does.Geez his old age problems are worse than Biden's and the media still gives him a pass on it.I predict the debate changes nothing at best and at worst Kamala could come off as okay and gets portrayed negatively by the media anyway.,negative

Either Biden will 1) retreat and withdraw in shame and execute the orders to pull out but be burned at the stake by the GOP for being a coward, or 2) he would defend his troops, maybe even double down and retaliate, extending a US presence and killing US soldiers for nothing, and the GOP would burn him at the stake for being a war hawk and burying the USA in another war when trump had ordered the withdrawal.

I think Stallone is a moderate Republican (also appears to donate money to right-of-center Democrats), as he endorsed John McCain back in 2008 but did not give any endorsements to Donald Trump.

"“Times chief political analyst Nate Cohn:

He occupies the center. A near majority of voters say Mr. Trump is “not too far” to the left or right on the issues, while only around one-third say he’s “too far to the right.” Nearly half of voters, in contrast, say Ms. Harris is too far to the left; only 41 percent say she’s “not too far either way.

Of course, Donald Trump does not actually “occupy the center” — what Cohn meant is that Trump is perceived as occupying the center. (At least according to this measure.) This is not an insignificant difference!

So where does that perception come from? It comes, in part, from news companies like the New York Times.

">The elections are not part of the electoral process?

Let me just state the fact for you one more time: the primaries are not an election. They are not part of the electoral process. They are the current method by which the major parties select their candidate.

They are not enshrined in law, or the constitution. Hell, primaries have only been a common practice for about 50 years.

Primaries are a fine way to pick candidates, but they aren't the only way, and they are definitely not institutional. Harris' selection was unorthodox, but ""extreme""? Please. Learn some history and find a way to relax, yeah?

Nothing has been taken from you. You can vote for whoever you want in November. I assume since you care about democracy it won't be the guy arguing in court that it's acceptable for a president to trick the VP into signing fraudulent certificates of ascertainment and elect the loser of the election.

That is how far removed you are from reality you are to defend this extreme action. 50 years of precedent is not enough? I never claimed they are the only way, you are arguing with yourself, which I can understand given the length you are going to make an absurd argument. What I did say is that a decision was made to NOT have an open convention, which is one of the other ways the party can select a candidate. I never said anything was taken from me, again you are inventing something do disagree with. Something has obviously been taken away from the members of the party, who traditionally have a voice in the selection of their candidate but in this extreme action, the voice of the people was ignored. 

You really seem to like making assumptions that you can disagree with, that is why this conversation is pointless. I am discussing facts and reality while you disagree with your assumptions. I am not the source of your internal conflict.",negative

[In Case You Missed It: Jill Stein to Campaign Today with Alleged Russian Assets](https://democrats.org/news/icymi-jill-stein-to-campaign-today-with-alleged-russian-assets/)

>Today \[on Sept 3, 2024\] in Tampa, third-party candidate Jill Stein is expected to express support for the Uhuru 3, three individuals facing federal changes for a “malign influence campaign,” which consists of conspiring to covertly sow discord in U.S. society, spread Russian propaganda, and interfere illegally in U.S. elections. Stein participated in a press conference for the Uhuru 3, is expected to attend the trial, and will host a panel discussion tonight. She has previously expressed support for the Uhuru 3 in a campaign video.

>Engaging with foreign assets is a pattern for Stein. Previously, the Senate Intelligence Committee investigated links between Stein’s 2016 campaign and Russia’s efforts to interfere in the election, while an indictment brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller found that the **Kremlin’s Internet Research Agency had used social media to promote her candidacy**. In 2015, Stein attended a gala in support of Russian propaganda television network, RT, where **she sat at the head table alongside Vladimir Putin** and Michael Flynn. Stein has **repeatedly parroted Kremlin views** and **posted a campaign video from Moscow’s Red Square** with language “ripped from Putin’s talking points.”

>Despite her ties to the Kremlin and Putin, the GOP has still embraced Jill Stein as a spoiler candidate. Donald Trump praised Jill Stein, saying he likes her “very much.”  Additionally, the GOP has been helping Stein with ballot access in an attempt to prop up her spoiler candidacy.",positive

"AI guy here, it all depends on how many images the model was trained on.

"One name for it is code-bias, it's mostly been accidental with generative AI, and some models have already started addressing this by increasing diversity in training material.

The main reason it happens is because the thing the system is going to know the most about, is the guy sitting at the desk in front of the camera talking to it. 

Most of the big players have already made solid progress on this for their public-facing products.

If I were her I'd want AI to be bad at generating images of me. I think using AI this way should be illegal.,negative
All of the AI pics I’ve seen of Kamala make her look even more beautiful 😂. Keep em coming I guess.,positive
"Many AI images of Kamala Harris are bad. A tweet featuring an AI-generated video showing Harris and Donald Trump in a romantic relationship—it culminates in her holding their love child, which looks like Trump—has nearly 28 million views on X. Throughout the montage, Harris morphs into what look like different people, while the notably better Trump imagery remains fairly consistent.

When we tried using Grok to create a photo of Harris and Trump putting their differences aside to read a copy of WIRED, the results repeatedly depicted the ex-president accurately while getting Harris wrong. The vice president appeared with varying features, hairstyles, and skin tones. On a few occasions, she looked more like former First Lady Michelle Obama.

Despite being a prominent figure, Harris hasn’t been as widely photographed as Trump. WIRED’s search of photo supplier Getty Images bears this out; it returned 63,295 images of Harris compared to 561,778 of Trump. Given her relatively recent entry into the presidential race, Harris is “a new celebrity,” as far as AI image makers are concerned, according to Cuenca Abela. “It always takes a few months to catch up,” he says.

That Harris is a Black woman, of Jamaican and Indian descent, also may be a factor. [Irene Solaiman](https://www.irenesolaiman.com/), head of global policy at AI company Hugging Face, says that “poorer facial recognition for darker skin tones and femme features” may affect the sorting of images of Harris for automated labeling. The issue of facial recognition failing to identify female and darker-skinned faces was first highlighted by the 2018 [Gender Shades study](http://gendershades.org/) published by Joy Boulamwini, an MIT researcher, and [Timnit Gebru](https://www.wired.com/story/google-timnit-gebru-ai-what-really-happened/), now the founder and executive director of the Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute.

It can not properly learn the positioning of hands with the limited examples, it would need exponential data to get it right. There is no exponential data on hand positions, but there are still many photos and illustrations.

Also, parameters in an AI model help. The more, the better. What is a parameter? If you have an image, it can have a ""retro"" likeness to it, it can be female, it can be male, it can be colorful, it can be gray, all these super fine details that humans do not get, the machine can read

I’m a 40 year old American living in Taiwan, and having experienced government-run healthcare….man, I hope I live to see the day when when a presidential candidate fights for that and pushes it through.

"I'm impressed with how quickly she developed it. about 45 days ago, she was assuming she was running on Biden's platform as vice president. She had very little time to put this together. While I'm sure she had this together in some way or another, that's very different than putting together a plan for people that is clearly articulated.

I'm glad she didn't bow to pressure and yet still did this so quickly.

Looking at this plan, I don't see how most Americans wouldn't vote for this (I know lots won't). Rent issues, price gouging, home ownership, childcare--these are four *massive* issues that people are still feeling.

When it looked like Biden might campaign on ""look how good my economy is,"" these issues were a big problem for me, and a reason I thought he'd certainly lose to Trump. The economy being ""good"" hasn't helped most Americans in decades. A person looking beyond the surface-level, like Kamala is arguing she will do, is huge.",positive
"I love this, clearly laid out policies and easy to understand. I would like to hear more about her policies on AI though. There are some extremely legitimate uses for AI in healthcare and data analysis, but it's currently wildly unregulated especially in artistic spaces. It's also extremely dangerous with regards to misinformation and images meant to look like people in...compromising positions. I have a feeling she's trying to appeal to the tech bros with this but it's definitely an area I'm concerned with. 


Also Trump is WAY WORSE in his support of AI and how he wants to produce more electricity specifically to keep server farms active. So I don't want anyone to think she lost my vote on this point, just something I'm concerned with that I hope she creates more detailed policies on later.",positive

""Bring down healthcare costs"" again, how?

""Invest in affordable childcare"" AGAIN, HOW? 

Credit where credits due: the $25,000 tax credit for homebuyers, expansion of entrepreneurship grants and loans and speaking generally to some specific tax proposals are fine. But all those need to go through congress.

2. There is a consumer benefit to pot being controlled and not flat out legal. The pot that is sold in legal shops is run through laboratories to test for heavy metals and mold/mildew. It’s that much safer for consumption. So when they do criminalize it they have to be careful about how they legalize it so not every idiot tries to sell moldy weed to unsuspecting consumers.

Some psychiatrists I have heard speak on the subject are critical of legalization for that reason, which I get that it comes with risks especially the people who are doing it all day every day. But that seems like a pretty narrow perspective to me, as plenty of things that we don’t put people in jail for participating in also carry health risks that appear much more severe. Smoking tobacco is the single biggest health modifying factor for a wide range of conditions. Alcohol itself is carcinogenic, can cause cirrhosis/neuropathy/organ failure, and has tons of social costs via DUIs, domestic violence and just dumb drunk people getting hurt needing the emergency room. Riding a motorcycle is so likely to get you killed that there was a guy who made bank taking out life insurance policies on customers of a motorcycle shop until the companies closed the loophole. All 100% legal.

Cannabis abuse definitely messes with people’s motivation and can increase the risk of mental health issues especially if overdone, but those risks shrink in comparison to what we know our legal substances entails.

"*From Bloomberg News reporter Josh Wingrove:*  
  
Vice President Kamala Harris is pledging to end subminimum wages for tipped workers, widening a push to eliminate taxes on tips as she jockeys with Donald Trump ahead of their first debate Tuesday.

In policy proposals posted to her website, Harris called for an increase in the overall minimum wage and for the end of the subminimum wage for tipped workers. Democrats have long pushed for the move and included it in their 2024 platform. She also reiterated a call to end taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers, a proposal Trump made first.

Harris and Trump are set for their first — and maybe only — debate Tuesday in Philadelphia. The forum will be a key moment for Harris to flesh out her pitch, particularly for voters who say they don’t know much about her, and for Trump to sharpen his critique, as he looks to tie Harris to her more progressive policy positions from the past.",positive

Lots of signs for other republicans though, the enthusiasm doesn’t seem the same as it once was. Maybe they’ll vote for him anyway but anecdotally there are a lot of things that don’t jive with the polls.",positive
I'm still seeing the same amount of trump flags :(,negative
"I’m seeing a lot of interviews of Republican voters where they admit they dislike Trump as a person but will be voting for him anyway.

Trump definitely still has tons of support (ie votes), it’s just that those rabid fans from 2020 are much much less enthusiastic about him this go around. They are simply holding their noses to pull the lever for him.",positive
"I live in a fairly red county, and I'm seeing fewer Trump signs than ever before. But I also just this weekend drove to my home county and took a different route than usual, through a small town, and there were several Trump signs and flags, along with a sign that said ""Kamel Toe Harris: The original hawk tuah girl,"" so the cult is still out there, being as classy as ever.

Of course, I haven't been through that town in many years, and I wasn't surprised to see it, given it until not terribly long ago had a Civil War museum/KKK shop on Main Street. I also wouldn't be surprised to find out that a few years ago, there were many more signs and flags.",positive
"Unfortunately in 2024 this debate will be won by the person with the best one liners, not the person with the best policies. Let's help her out

Rebut with a great one-line....

""Bing, bing, bing bing........was that him going off script again, or the just the facts checker working overtime ""

Follow through with a policy statement.  The old one-two

I'm sure we can give her a few good one-liners",positive
"Honestly I've been trying to be objective about Kamala to try to understand where she comes off lacking to the other side and I've concluded maybe it's because her style is less bombastic. Like Obama livened up the room, he was inspiring, he oozed confidence and charisma, he was quick with the quips, he modulated his tone to fit the speeches, perfectly timed pauses to make a point or emphasize an argument, increased the tempo to avoid slack in attention. Basically he was a natural.

Trump just annoys the hell out of me and screams liar but if I try to forget who he is, he does give off a certain brash confident energy/a certain showmanship/a looser storytelling style  that can for the very very ignorant and biased voter act as a solidification of belief that he's got the chops. Like he sells himself well to his particular base because he's like a snake oil salesman, he's got an oily charm that can be mistaken for gravitas and ability. 

Kamala makes a less overt impression..at the DNC she brought the energy but during the CNN interview, while she hit all the correct notes, her energy was quieter, more solemn..I liked it because I already like her. But maybe she needs to be louder and firmer. Being a woman, people already approach her with some preconceived notions and biases that she can't do the job and because there is no template or precedent for a female president, she has to create the template. Which is also why she needs to do more interviews, more freewheeling ones but also ones where she shows her louder/stern/more brashly confident side. And she needs to bring more flair, more chutzpah.",positive
"Trump will threaten the media themselves and the shortsighted, greedy MF’rs will **still** sane wash him.",negative
The bar is set so high for Kemala and so very low for Trump. If he remains upright and doesn’t start to eat the podium the media will applaud his stellar performance. If she makes one slight misstep deep into the minutiae of foreign policy the media will jump all over it and say she blew the debate.,positive
Please do elaborate,positive
"agree, media will try to make this a close race to make money and try to define what this debate means for harris. she'll be fine and her campaign momentum
will continue unabated. i dont give a shit what msm has to say about her debate performance",positive
"It’s not about changing the minds of people that are supporting him, but showing to ones who are still on the sideline that she has solid policies and a concept for the future of America. A big problem right now is much of what she supports and is aiming for is unknown beyond women’s rights.",positive
I really hope that one day people learn that charisma means jack shit about any other qualities of a person or their suitability for a job. Even acting or performing… surprisingly many people are uncharismatic in one context and when representing themselves rather than a persona,positive

"The difficulty with Rogan is that it's three hours.

So for people that invest the three hours, they usually get to know the guest well and feel more positively toward them.

That's the risk.",positive
"Honestly, Joe Rogan rarely antagonizes his guests, and when he does, he does NOT typically come off sounding smarter than them. I’d say sure, go ahead, but be prepared for bad faith conservative “gotcha” questions just in case. Remain likeable and friendly at all times.

After all the racist anti black things Joe Rogan has said and endorsed on his podcast?  She may piss ppl who are voting for her off more than she will convert his faithfuls. It would be shameless pandering to an audience that is mad women can vote and minorities don’t do what they are told anymore. Absolutely not.,negative

"Honestly...and, I hate to say this...I think she would do well to go on Rogan.  I can't stand the guy, but she needs to broaden her appeal with his listener demographic and, as Mayor Pete often points out, you have to take your message to the people who otherwise won't hear it.",negative

I'd rather see her in hot ones. Joe Rogan stopped being interesting 5 years ago.,positive
"I used to like Joe but I haven't listened to him in a long time, he was fun to listen to and entertain the conspiracy theories. After one interview with a returning guest I went back to listen to their first appearance and Joe was talking about a documentary about the lawyers trying to convince people smoking wasn't as bad as it was being made out to be. I believe the Doc was called ""Merchants of doubt"" and it didn't take me long to realize Joe had become a Merchant of doubt. He only ever seems to have conspiracy theorist and crackpots, or doctors who were part of a single study that found a weird instance that hasn't been replicable or found in the metadata studies. I cheered when he had Bernie Sanders on and cringed when I heard he had RFK on. Joe has become the enemy of his younger self. It feels like I am living that part of ""The Dark Knight"" where I am seeing my heroes become the enemy.",negative
To date the Rogan Bernie Sanders interview is the best Bernie Sanders interview on record. I think she should go on Rogan if she's comfortable speaking in long form about her beliefs.,positive
Harris and Walz should do hot ones,neutral
"I haven't listened to Rogan lately, but he was a fair interviewer back in the last campaign cycles. He gave Bernie Sanders a full 3 hour episode. Which is about 2:58 more than any corporate media outlet gave him. 

Kamala should have enough of that ""prosector"" mode left in her to get through any interview or debate and know if somebody's trying to trap her into a soundbite that can be twisted against her. So yeah, why not? She also could reach some voters who aren't going to watch MSDNC or FAUX",positive
She should go on Joe rogan and they should eat hot wings together.  Kill two interviews with one stone.,negative
"It just baffles me that for three straight elections, the Democrats have failed to field a candidate who is both able and willing to go anywhere and talk to anyone, instead playing into Trump's hands with one coin toss election after another.

Why is it so impossible since Obama to find a Democratic candidate of age under late 70s who actually demonstrates something resembling people skills of a politician.",negative

She grew up with an Indian mom. My moneys on her being able to handle hot food,neutral
No you throw Walz on Hot Ones and enjoy all the jokes about how the first wing is too spicy for him when they coordinate to give him a wing with nothing on it.  Let Kamala sit with Rogan and let his bro listeners hear an actually intelligent person speak.,positive

Joe Rogan is an antagonizing tool who has spread Covid misinformation and hosts guests who spread blatant misinformation on a bevy of subjects.

He is antagonizing because he makes racist and antisemitic comments. He spouts transphobic crap.

[Joe Rogan Draws Backlash For Antisemitic Comments—Spotify Silent On Latest Controversy From Its Biggest Podcaster (forbes.com)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2023/02/08/joe-rogan-draws-backlash-for-antisemitic-comments-spotify-silent-on-latest-controversy-from-its-biggest-podcaster/)

Kamala should not waste her time with being questioned by a racist and bigot like Rogan.",negative
"She’s half Indian, shit wouldn’t phase her.",negative
"I actually really loved the Bernie Sanders interview on Rogan’s podcast. Of course, that was pre-Covid so it was before Rogan went completely off the rails",positive
"This!! You are totally right- it could be good. He is a good listener and often fair. I do think she can handle him. And I think it would help showcase her abilities to talk to a not her typical crowd, to level with a not fan. Maybe convince some of the more reasonable listeners of Rogan even. Honestly think she should do it.",positive
Having Jamie there as well would be interesting if asked to bring something up as I think Jamie does his best to make sure the source is neutral. He's brought up stories that disprove Joe and stories Joe thinks proves his point but will stop reading halfway through b/c he realizes there's something that reveals the whole picture & he moves on (for better or worse).,positive
"That really would be a great split of a ""I'm for the people"" and a softball interview.  Kind of like going on MTV back in the day.  He is also a really good interviewer so it could come off really well, especially if she made it all the way through.",positive
"Could you imagine Daily Show or even Real Time with Bill!? I think Stewart would legitimately interview him and probably piss him off in an instant. I can't stand Bill, because he has deeply fallen into a boomer echo chamber. However, I know he and Trump absolutely loath one another. It would be entertaining to see their fakeness devolve into madness.",negative

This. Pretty sure she’d get to dictate the terms.,positive
"That could help.

Personally, I'd like to see her to friendly podcasts more than this.

Give her a chance to fully explain her policies and views on life, some good personal stuff too.

She could do ten of those, at whatever length.

Then consider Rogan later.  

We need to remember that Rogan would love to bring her down, so there's always that.",positive
He'd definitely say no and then tell his audience that she declined the proper scrutiny that all his other guests submit to.,positive
"Yeah, not a bad idea.  As I responded to someone else, I think she has many better options than Rogan.  When we know Rogan would love to bring her down, it's just not worth it in my view.",positive
"The hot ones audience is probably already voting for her. Going on Joe Rogan, like Bernie did, might actually move the needle a little bit in swing states.",positive
"I think so too, but this election is far too important to risk going in blind. She’d have to try Da Bomb before scheduling the interview.",negative
Holy shit. I would love to see Walz on there,positive
"Walz would muscle through, but the reactions would be incredibly entertaining.

However, don’t underestimate how much confidence Harris would inspire by keeping her composure throughout. Also, Harris instead of Walz puts pressure on Trump. Having Walz do it puts pressure on Vance to reciprocate, and I fear he’d fair better. Of course, Walz and Harris could certainly do it together.",positive
Last wing just coated in mayo,neutral
"Kamala should probably go on Lex Friedman.

Lex is a terrible, useless interviewer, but his audience overlaps with a lot of the other personalities.  Walz could do Theo Von.",negative
Agreed!,positive
"Joe Rogan is a gullible moron who has fallen deep into the conspiracy trash can and pushes quacks and grifters to millions of people. No one, especially the Vice President and candidate for President should be doing anything to legitimize him. The only reason any one should be going on to his podcast these days (besides all the people trying to grow their own influence and find more gullible people to grift money from) are people who will call Joe Rogan an idiot to his face and demonstrate what a hysterical, conspiratorial loon he is.",negative
Bill would be sucking Trumps toes three minutes in. Why even out him in the same sentence as Jon?,positive
[removed],neutral
"Rogan gets a lot of shit for expressing his own crazy ass views, but he does a really good job of just listening to his guests and letting the fully explain their positions and points without trying to stir the pot.",neutral
Pete would be a better person. She's not the podcast type I think. ,positive
"On the flip side, she might show that she is not the crazy person the average Rogan voter thinks she is and can help in swing states, it's not like she will lose votes she can only gain them. And whoever does the podcast can't be seen as democratic shill, Rogan is definitely not on team Democrats. We know she won't flop or look stupid, so it's a win-win in my mind.",positive
"I think Hot Ones viewers who like Sean and his guests are probably already In Harris’s column, but I think a contingent of viewers are younger apolitical YouTube video aficionados who would simply be impressed by a politician appearing on a modern, culturally relevant, non-traditional media channel while holding her own eating incredibly spicy wings. I think that could generate enthusiasm and inspire some to act who would otherwise stay home.",positive
This exactly!,neutral
Mad that part of politics in 2024 could be a candidate having to do a taste test run of Da Bomb,negative
Good lord.. do you have any idea how bad that would be for Vance when it comes to the depth of research that Hot Ones does?,negative
"""OH god that's hot!  Is that a CARROT?!?""",positive
How many people listen to his podcast though? What percentage of them vote? I'm willing to bet a large percentage of his audience votes and that's a lot of people and I believe Kamala Harris will be able to sway a small percentage of them bc she will show she is not a quack or grifter. It's the same reason Pete Butiggeg does so good on Fox.,positive
Actually I take back what I said- you may be right. I was thinking his audience at least on reddit is very anti trump. They are not exactly kamala supporters either but they routinely make fun of trump so in terms of attracting the attention of an otherwise undecided contingent of viewers who at least seem vaguely politically invested may not be too bad..,positive
Oh now you care about accuracy?,positive
"I would agree with that with one proviso.  He's never had the responsibility of interviewing Presidential candidates.  How hard does he push, when does he listen, when does he just say ""that's bullsit"".

(I don't consider RFK a Presidential candidate if that came to mind).",positive
"People who are still watching Joe Rogan do not have the ability to determine who is a quack or grifter. Treating Joe Rogan like a serious individual would be a terrible move for a Presidential hopeful.

Pete does well on Fox News because he specifically pushes back on their narratives and doesn’t treat going on there like he is going to have a friendly chat.",positive
"We will just have to agree to disagree, I think she can do the same as him with Rogan.",neutral

He couldn't deny it, it was right before him,

But still, he refused to let it in him.

"She is running on zero policies except embracing GOP arguments about ecofascism on the border, and has said clearly that under no circumstances will she cut aid or arms to Israel, indicating we can expect every single child in Gaza to be dead within the next 2 years. Given that she could simply pick up the phone, call Netanyahu, and threaten to join the arms embargo civilized countries are holding against them, and Netanyahu would fold and accept the cease fire on the spot, just as Nixon, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, and Obama ALL had to do and did without issue. That she is less willing to stand in the way of genocide than George Bush or Richard Nixon bodes extremely poorly in terms of ""real humanity and empathy""

I'm afraid there is no way to convince people whose extended families have been exterminated to vote for their exterminator. Kamala will not get these voters back without making that same call her predecessors made. Seeing how many people have come to enthusiastically support the extermination of the Palestinian people in order to support Kamala's investment banking cartel run/oriented campaign.

">You buy someone a sandwich because they are hungry and they sincerely thank you like it's the nicest thing ever.

When I lived in the city there was an unhoused guy that always sat outside a bodega I frequented.  I started tossing him my change after I came out. Then I started saying 'hi' to him once in a while. He *never* initiated any interaction with me. Then, when the weather warmed up, he started having a cat with him and I started having longer conversations with him. His name was Evan, his cat's name was Poppy, he came from a bad home and he'd been bouncing between finding work and not being able to hold down a job for *years* because he was always being paid under the table because he didn't have a place of residence and he couldn't find work that would pay enough to get an apartment. But on cold days he left his cat at 'home', wherever that was, with food and water because he didn't want her out in the cold weather.

It breaks my heart even now, 20 years later, thinking about this guy who was doing the best he could with the hand he was dealt and all I could do was get him the occasional sandwich and food he would share with his stray cat friend.

Dr Steven Hassan was recently on the David Pakman Show and discussed what lead him from leaving the Unification Church cult where he was a fairly high ranking member. He was approached several times by people asking about what leader Sun Myung Moon had said ina  speech to Congress. He asked other church members and they showed Steven a transcript of the statements, which included Moon talking about how ""Americans were too smart to be brainwashed by a Korean."" In private, in front of Steven Hassan, Moon had repeatedly talked about how Americans were some of the stupidest people in the world and were easily manipulated.

"I actually saw a number of Harris signs this evening.  Anyway, I think part of the lack of Harris signs is that Harris is relatively new on the campaign.

I’m pretty excited about Harris and you’d never catch a sign in my yard or on my car. They’re politicians not sports teams.,positive
"I’m seeing more Harris ones each day. My current favorite I walk by to work and it says “Harris/walz, obviously”",positive
"I mean Silver's point still stands.

My guess is if you started seeing more signs or fewer signs than you did in prior years, you would see a higher or lower rate of turnout, respectively. Again, it might end up being a tiny change, but I'm just saying that enthusiasm can be identified in multiple ways, and a multitude of signs can indicate that the candidate will perform better than a candidate with no visible enthusiasm.",positive

">PHILADELPHIA (Sept. 4, 2024) – Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced $23.8 million in Small Watershed grants to support Chesapeake Bay Watershed restoration efforts. $11.6 million of the funding awarded is funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and $9.3 via regular annual appropriations. This program is currently administered by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) through a grant from EPA’s Chesapeake Bay Program Office. The 56 grant awards will support water quality improvement, habitat restoration, and community stewardship efforts in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. In total, the grants will leverage $12.8 million in matching contributions to generate a total conservation impact of $36.6 million.

>The grants were awarded through the Small Watershed Grants (SWG) program, a key funding mechanism of the federal-state Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) partnership designed to support projects within the Chesapeake Bay watershed that promote voluntary, community-based efforts to protect and restore the diverse and vital habitats of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributary rivers and streams. Major funding for these awards is provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, with additional support provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, U.S. Forest Service, and Altria Group.

>The SWG program is administered under NFWF’s Chesapeake Bay Stewardship Fund (CBSF), in partnership with CBP and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The CBSF is an ongoing 25-year partnership between NFWF and other federal and private funders that provides grant funding, technical assistance, networking and information sharing programming in support of local, on-the-ground conservation and restoration efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay watershed.  
...  

Partial list of recipients in the press release, full list in a link at the bottom. Statement from EPA Regional Administrator Adam Ortiz:

>""Investments such as these are paramount to ensuring progress across the Bay and in all sectors,” said EPA Regional Administrator Adam Ortiz. “We are proud to work with our partners and fund these projects to make a difference in the restoration of the Bay watershed.""

Statement from Martha Shimkin, Director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Chesapeake Bay Program Office:

>""We are proud to fund these projects, which will support restoration of ecosystems throughout the Bay watershed,” said Martha Shimkin, Director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Chesapeake Bay Program Office. “From blue crabs to brook trout, we are focusing on restoring and conserving our living resources that are both important to the local economy and our region’s natural heritage. The work to protect and restore our waterways is a true community effort and through these conservation projects, we can continue to build on our current momentum.”",positive

"Before every debate, each candidate wants to raise expectations for their opponent and lower them for themselves. You want the public to expect to be wowed by the other guy and think ""well, they did what they could"" about you. That way (hopefully) there's no way they can live up to expectations and no way you can fall short of yours.

And I swear to god, the reddit political subs fall for it every time.

All I'm seeing here is how Kamala is going to crush and embarass Trump, and how Trump's going to struggle to not shit himself and cry or drop N-bombs or something. The same shit as before the first debate with Biden.

Yes, she's a former prosecutor and probably well prepared. Yeah, he's a weirdo who rambles incoherently. But all this sub is doing (and the media at large) is setting their expectations at a harder and harder level for Harris to possibly reach, and making it easier and easier to just hand-waive away a terrible performance by Trump.

This is *exactly* what the Trump campaign wants. They're probably the ones behind a fair number of the leaks that Trump is worried about bombing the debate. Their goal (and every campaign's goal) is always to lower expectations for their candidate and raise them for the opposition.",neutral
She's a trained and seasoned prosecutor. This is her arena and she's had 8 years to learn Trump's bullshit. I'm not worried.,negative

"Not gonna diss her qualifications, but she was smoked during the primary debate. And if she wasn't debating a senile fascist rotten lima bean, I don't think she would look so great.",negative
"Exactly.  I've been saying this for so long....  the bar of what is ""good"" in the eyes of the public is very different for these two.   Trump can do just about anything because that's the expectation.   If she has a slightly off night, is tired, is...anything other than perfect, it will be called out and it will count against her.",positive
"True. But, it isn’t just that is it. Trump is always graded on a curve. Everyone fucking knows it. I believe secretly people want to see his trash taken out to the bin. Thats is why people hype up the opponent. 

People want to see Trump fail in real time like they want to see the curtain pulled away from the wizard. Mostly because they are too lazy to see the trail of destruction that has already been established. 

In school he was a terrible student but he got pushed through because of his family’s money. He lost all the money from the businesses his father handed him and banks kept giving him money. In his real estate business, he didn’t create shit he bought in on deals to stick his name on. Any of the other deals for non real estate like his steaks, airline, vodka, even university were all basically licensing deals and he fucked them up.  His books all ghostwritten fake drivel. 

The Apprentice. Also sported a made up facade of opulence and success because trump was a dated hot mess.

Yet in all these instances regardless of how shit they were they were perceived as successes borne of his ingenuity. Any failures were attributed to others. They willingly bought his lines and graded the rich white dude on a curve as a chit they may need to cash later for a favor.

There’s two outcomes.
1. Trump won’t shit his pants and they’ll say he won
2. Trump will shit his pants and they’ll blame Vice President Harris for beating up on a poor demented elderly benevolent soul that ran the score up on a man with well documented mental health issues so she is a mean arrogant angry mixed race black angry childless woman",negative
"Another thing I dont think a lot of people are taking into account is that the orange man is about to spend ninety long minutes effectively out of reach from his campaign staff, with a constant negative force being pressed against him.

Let the party leadership pick their nominee and then let people vote among many parties and options. When people bellyache about not having an open primary process for Kamala I just roll my eyes and wonder why we have a primary in the first place. If you don’t like who the Republican or Democratic Party picked as their nominee, then start to canvas and promote a third party that is viable at a national level because it has been built from the ground up at the local level.",positive

I am more hopeful now than I had been with any other presidential candidate in my lifetime. When it was announced that Kamala was going to be gunning for the nomination, it was like all the negativity that had been building for the democrats this year got completely flipped on its head and she set the country on fire (in a good way, that is).

I’ve never been more excited to vote. I voted for Biden out of necessity, I will vote for Kamala because I believe she can make some change.",positive

And I have been trying to think if we have ever seen trump mingle with people in a store or restaurant that isn’t at his golf club?  I can’t think of any time. But…the whole time Harris was hugging and taking selfies with her admirers and watching the woman crying and others talking a few inches from her face…the only thing I worried about was I hoped none of them have COVID or the flu and get Kamala sick so she performs terribly during the debate. It is nice that Kamala does that but a whole lot of people are dealing with COVID right now. She cannot afford to get sick.,negative

"Now can this sub finally acknowledge that Kamala is actually shaping up to be a pretty strong candidate, and that a significant portion of the excitement around her candidacy could be because people like her? (not only because she is simply ""not Trump"")

A lot of people here talk about how the Democrats are enthusiastic about her because we have no choice or just because they like her VP pick; but I feel that a lot of people actually realized she could make a great president. Also, she broke grassroots fundraising records for presidential candidates even before she announced Walz as her running mate; yet some people claim that if she wins it would only be because Walz carried her. In reality, Kamala's former career as a prosecutor gives her a ""law and order"" image that is probably quite helpful on it's own for winning over moderate swing-voters (many of whom rate crime or public safety as one of their top concerns behind the economy).",positive

She’s giving her time to people who aren’t megadonors. She’s listening to them. She’s talking to them as fellow people. She hugs people and it’s not awkward. She knows policy specifics and takes an active interest in governance. She’s kind and steadfast, firm yet empathetic.",positive

That’s rare for a politician today.",positive
"I understand why she is crying. I’m from Appalachia not far from Pittsburgh and I just don’t understand why such kind and caring people who raised me in the community now justify everything Trump says and does. He does literally everything I was raised not to do by these people. It’s so bewildering and I feel like I don’t know any of these people anymore. Different politics views is one thing but admiration and a religious cult like fanaticism to a guy who has zero in common with my community is just so sobering. I’m actually getting emotional typing this just thinking about how distant I’ve grown from family and friends since 2016 when family and community was everything to me. 

To me, Kamala (children of immigrants) and immigrants embody the greatness of what America use to be - immigrants and many minority communities have an insanely strong sense of community. They call each other Auntie and Uncle even if they aren’t related by blood we are related by the human spirit. The idea of it takes a village to raise a child is a strong foundation in immigrant communities and white America has become so individualistic it’s tearing us apart. We’ve become so focused on ourselves we’ve adopted “the hell with everyone else” mentality. I’m a millennial who grew up in that old time, blue collar mentality where we all knew who was wealthy but the wealthy lived on the same block as everybody else. They paid their taxes - maybe not happily but they understood there was more to life than money. They understood community, neighbors, and a sense of belonging was more valuable than more tax breaks. Community was everything and now Trump and the GOP has divided us and compartmentalized so much it’s now an us against them mentality and it’s just so disheartening.

I’m voting for Kamala not because I agree with her on all the policies or because I think she is perfection. I’m voting for her because she still embodies the idea that we all are in it together. No matter religion, race, education, wealth, sexual identity. We all live together and work together and we are all aunties and uncles. We live in a period of profound loneliness in this country and while there are various reasons a big one is the grievance politics has alienated us from each other. The constant Fox News BS propaganda brainwashing everybody saying that the world is evil, your neighbors are evil and the churches also saying this make us all lonelier than ever. Trump and the GOP white grievance has broken me, honestly. So to the lady crying, I get it and thank you for that moment because it’s such a moral booster to see I’m not alone in that feeling.",negative

We live in Georgia, and my mom, a life-long Republican who never once considered voting for Trump, cries a lot these days.


She is the only one among her friends she's known for 60+ years who is not in the tank for Trump.


I sit with her at her dining-room table in her deep-red neighborhood and listen as she cries about ""I thought I KNEW them,"" and ""but these are GOOD people!""


She is so confused and depressed over how so many people of her generation seem to have abandoned both their moral compasses and their ability to think critically about anything. What has happened to these people, who she knows were raised with the same values she was, but now support a man who is the antithesis of those values?


Poor mom. I tell her, gently, that this was how I felt when I was a teen watching her vote for a party that I could see went against every value she taught me.


I'm so glad I became cynical and embittered as a 10-year-old, instead of living my whole life believing in something that turned out to be a sham.

She stated that she was ""confused"" over who to vote for. Our fellow block walker, bless him, tried to engage with a woman who is barely and I mean BARELY holding it together.

"I’m going to push back on, of all things, Marvel movies. I contend they are popular for the opposite reason. DC movies are the ones that present their heroes as gods, untouchable. Except for die hards, these movies are considered commercial and artistic failures. Marvel movies have been popular because they show the vulnerability of characters, often with a sense of humor.

This does relate to our political wasteland. The MAGA’s have been freed to let their inner bully emerge with no consequences. Combine this with the smugness American Christians already feel, and now you’re cooking. You can hate real hard, but underneath there’s that satisfaction of being one up on whoever you’re hating. It’s a technique as old as time, and it’s obvious we haven’t evolved much. Their humor, as well as their entire mindset, is all about punching down, and you’re always punching down if you have enough hate in your heart,

I would argue that Congress does not need to do anything.  The Anderson decision says congress must decide, not that they need to take action.  I would argue they have already decided with their votes in Trump's second impeachment.  He just IS disqualified. 

As for enforcement mechanisms, it comes down to Roberts and the swearing in ceremony. 14.3 doesn't say anything about elections, so Trump can still run and win.  He just can't take office.  Roberts would need to refuse to seat him.  In that case, Vance would be President?  

Since Roberts thinks the Constitution is not binding he will of course swear Trump in anyway.

If the tax is increased to 28%, I would pay $2800. But I know that. So if that bill is about to pass or about to go into effect, what do I do? I sell now, at the lower rate. Huge numbers of people doing this would essentially crash the stock market. This would devalue all the unsold stocks.

Answer this - you bought $20,000 of stock X a few years ago.  It's now worth $50,000.  That's a $30,000 capital gain.  You have two choices:

1: you can sell it this year and be taxed 20% on it = $6,000

2: you can sell it next year and be taxed 28% on it = $8,400 (forfeited $2,400 in extra taxes)

If you sell it this year, you can buy it back at about the same price and sell it in the future, but now only paying on the gains vs. the current price (not the $20K you paid for it years ago).

So, people that invest and pay taxes think about these things . . . So these high earners (who also own the most stocks vs. other lower income groups) decides to sell tons of shares between the election and the end of the year to lock in the lower tax rates.

Now, you probably have heard of supply and demand, right?  Now there is a ton of supply of these shares of stock and no where close to enough demand - what happens to the price of those shares and the stock market in general?  It's gonna go down - possibly even significantly, right? You following along still?

Tell me, as a middle income earner - what does that do to the balance in your 401K or IRA when the market drops a significant amount in value?  Are you ready for that?  

Remember, the top 1% own over 50% of all stocks!  

You might not care if the stock market drops by 25% . . . but most Americans do care - because most Americans are saving for retirement and are counting on stock market returns to live a comfortable life in retirement - even if they are only middle income earners.",positive
"I don’t make 1 million/year and I have some serious apprehensions about this tax proposal. 

How does the valuation work? It is very difficult to get the true market value because market value can be manipulated as we saw with Trump’s case in New York

 How will it affect market liquidity? Taxpayers would be forced to liquidate assets in order to pay tax on unrealized gains, and these liquidations would reduce American holdings on US companies which could be ripe for foreign take over.

The potential for capital flight if they are taxing unrealized gains will investors continue to invest in the US? What about startups after a year of success their investors would have to liquidate? Seems like an awful business environment.

retirement accounts are not subject to capital gains. that’s the whole point of using them,positive

This also assumes that the new tax policy doesn’t have a look back period. Additionally, most peoples retirement accounts and 401(k)s are invested in index funds and mutual funds and not individual securities so you could not crash stocks by selling them. Even if you were able to affect them, a significant decline in the market due to tax policy, would not affect the middle-class as the policy would not apply to them. They may see a temporary dip in their 401(k) is as the market adjusts the new tax pricing structure, but the best advice to them would be to not sell and to hold while things stabilize in the long run.",positive

"See that's the problem when people don't think things through circularly - or in full.

So the top 1% owns 50% of all the shares of stock trading in the US markets.

You or me, as a middle income earning household, also own (what seems to us) like a lot of shares of stock in Mutual Funds, ETFs and single company shares in our retirement accounts - this is true for about 62% of American's own stocks that are traded in the markets - either individual, 401K, IRA or through pension funds.

If you have (pretending you make a LOT of money) $250,000 in gains that are not currently realized (because you still own the stocks) and you know that capital gains will be 20% this, but 28% next year and going forward.

Do you sell those stocks for the $250,000 in gains this year and own 20% on that gain?

Do you sit on those stocks and sell them at a time when the tax rate is going to be 28%?  

Obviously, you are generally wise to sell them now at a lower tax rate, buy them back at a high basis point so that when you realize a gain in the future, your tax bill will be lower AND your potential to strategically sell them at a loss will be more likely?

Now you, as a middle income household with tens or hundreds of thousands in your retirement accounts, what do you think will happen to the markets (and your retirement account balances) when there is huge amounts of selling at the end of this year (to lock in the lower rates)?  There will be a huge supply of for sale stocks and not a very strong demand from buyers.

Not only that, but instead of tax loss harvesting this year, wise people will carry any losses into next year to apply against any gains next year.  

If the market crashes by 25% and you are getting closer to retirement, that's problematic.

If the market crashes by 25% -  you now need to see the market increase by 33% just to get back to where you were.

The problem with some people (and Democrats are notorious for this), they refuse to see or comprehend the ""unintended consequences"" that so many people were warning about.

All that said, it's not that I am opposed to adjusting our tax system and for the highest earners to pay a little bit more and also for all earners to pay at least something in Federal Income Taxes.  One of the items I've always thought made sense was not having a cap on Social Security taxes at the 6.2% rate.

"How many homes do you already own and how much money are you set to inherit?  

I live in an apartment and won't inherit a dime, but this tax would apply to me as well.

If you were born into 7 million dollars in the modern day you are barely in the top 10% (not 1%, not 0.1%, but top 10%) of families in the US. After the taxes I already face, I will not have that unless I live like a broke college student for a decade. And that assumes I continued to hoard it all instead of using it to support my parents who are nearing 70 years old with no retirement in the bank.  

I've never met anyone else in my situation wholeheartedly support taxes that screw us over. High-income earners are generally not the people who are hoarding all the wealth in the country.

Owned the home for at least 2 years.
Lived in the home as your main home for at least 2 years.  
Did not use this gain exclusion on the sale of any other home in the last 2 years.

"Your ""theory"" falls apart when put into practice in the real world. 

Prior to 2013, the long term capital gains tax rate was 15%, even for top earners.  The American Taxpayers Relief Act of 2012 (effective 1/1/2013) increased the top LTCG rate from 15% to 20%, and added a 3.8% Medicare surcharge for those earning over $200k.  So the top rate for the top earners went from 15% in 2012 to 23.8% in 2013.  

So how did the S&P 500 do in 2013, the year the increases went into effect.  32%!  The market hadn't seen those types of results since 1997, and we haven't had those types of results ever since.  Even though the LTCG rates went up over 8% for the highest earners, wealthy people were still pushing the prices of stock up. 

By the way, in 2014, the S&P 500 increased another 13.5%, so you can't really say 2013 was a fluke.

So who doesn't ""understand reality""?",positive
"We are also talking about assets over $100M.  Like any progressive tax scheme, your first $100M in unrealized capital gains is free. And the overwhelming majority of these unrealized gains come from publicly traded stocks. Valuation is pretty straightforward to calculate.

As for startups, 1) again, it is for over $100M.  So if you have $200M in unrealized capital gains, your tax bill will be $28M.  You'll be fine. 

As for capital flight, that is unlikely. What investors want is security. There is a reason they keep the bulk of their money in North America. It will be there when they need it. Potentially losing 28% is a lot better than losing all of it. Plus this will presumably reset the cost basis for the investment, offsetting future capital gains.

"it does come back to everybody else . . . if you are a middle income household and you have a fair amount of money in the stock market (401K, IRA, pension, or a college savings 529 to pay for your kids college) it will hurt you.

Why? The top 1% owns 50% of all shares of stock traded in the market.  It is far smarter for them to realize their gains this year when the rate is 20% than to wait until next year when they are going to be taxed a LOT more (nearly 50% more in taxes to be paid).

So, now the owners of 50% of stock shares are going to be selling them between the election and the end of the year.  What do you think happens to the markets?  Tons of selling - who's going to buy all those shares? You surely understand supply and demand factors.

Now you're a 55 year old with $500,000 in your 401K.  The stock market drops 25% as a result of this massive selling.  You now have $375,000 in your 401K and need to get a return of 33% just to get you back to where you were today!  Yet, you're approaching retirement quicker than you realize.

This actually has the potential to hurt the middle class investors (note that 62% of Americans own shares of stocks) more than the wealthy in the grand scheme of things.

And trust me on this, the hedge funds and family funds that also have huge stock holdings will clearly see the same thing - so not only do you have the wealthy selling, but you also have a lot of the institutional investors selling - a 25% pull back may be a best case scenario.

And it won't take long for the better informed middle income households that actually pay attention to this, the markets, etc. . . to do the same thing - move their investment selections out of stocks and into money market accounts just to protect their retirement savings.

I am very suspicious of your comment. There's no way you're scrapping by on $1 million and highly doubt that an increase of 8% in the long-term capital gains tax is going to leave you on the brink of being destitute. If that is truly the case it sounds like you're living beyond way your means and need to analyze your finances more as you've probably over extended yourself.",positive

"The reason why the market had a decent year in 2013 was that it finally after 4 years we were recovering from the Great Recession.  It wasn't until 2013 that the market had finally clawed back to where it was in 2007 and 2008.  The S&P had a return of 29%.

2013 was also the year that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts were made permanent.  There was a lot of concern that the tax rates were going to be raised in 2012 for 2013 - and when the prior administrations tax cuts were made permanent - this propelled the economy to accelerate.

You'll also note that in 2011 total Capital Gains taxes collected was $56,000,000 (which was the highest in 3 years by the way)

In 2012, the last year before the Cap Gains tax rate increase, Capital gains taxes collected was $91,000,000 (a 62.5% increase over the prior year, even when the market didn't do anything exceptionally well).  Which shows that a lot of gains/taxes were pulled forward in 2012 vs. waiting for 2013.

In 2013, even with the market up nearly 30%, the Capital Gains taxes collect was only $98,000,000 (less than a 10% increase over the prior year).  When the market is up 30% in a year, Cap Gains tax receipts should explode higher - even without a higher tax rate!

And if you go back and look at 2012 - you'll also notice that the second half of the year, when investors knew the new tax rate on Cap Gains would be going up - you see that the market stagnated and even dropped.  This was the result of selling to lock in gains at the lower tax rates.  And we're forgetting, that shares owned before the 2009 financial crisis weren't even back to a point of showing a gain in many, many companies.  So that means less selling of those holdings - which reduced total selling of shares to avoid the higher taxes.

The difference then vs. now is that at that time, our economy was finally picking up speed and momentum (remember, it was the slowest recovery ever from a recession in the USA).  The economy now is in a much more precarious situation.  We're hoping for a soft landing vs. a recession.  We're hoping that stagflation doesn't end up being the final result.

So we have several significant factors - locking in gains at a lower rate in a market that is stretched in terms of multiples in an economy that is teetering between at best a soft landing and the alternatives being worse.

As a nation we are over stretched in terms of our national debt and as consumers, we are carrying way too much personal debt - in a very high rate environment.

This isn't a political statement - but knowing how things are right now and where we stand - I think (and I surely admit it's my opinion) that this will be a very big negative for the markets.  

I know my personal reaction will be that if we elect a person who promises to raise capital gains taxes by 40% over where they are now, that I will move out of stocks and into other investments (money market, bonds, etc. . . ) and then buy back in after any notable pull back.  Not for avoiding capital gains (I don't make $1M/yr), just for anticipation of what I expect the market to do in such an event.  So in the worse case scenario and I am wrong, and I move out of equities and into bonds/MM and the market goes up 5% between the election and the end of the year - I've still locked in suitable gains for the year and have only forgone a small amount of additional gains had I stayed invested - noting that I would still see gains on my alternative investments.

In my book for risk management at my age (proximity to retirement), this is simply a better risk management approach than hoping that after an inevitable Cap Gains tax rate hike the following year, that there isn't massive selling to lock in gains at the lower rate.",positive

"No you actually didn't.

You can see the actual Capital Gains tax receipts in 2011 (and before), in 2012 (just prior to the rate increase) and in 2013 after the increase.  (Refer to my post above - from the tax [foundation.org](http://foundation.org) and based on US Govt reporting)

You can clearly see the numbers support my argument - it is plain as day.  A 62,5% increase in Cap Gains collected  just prior to a higher tax rate going into effect.

And this is even further reinforced that even after a market increase in 2013, that the Cap Gains receipts barely went up at all!  In fact, when you adjust for the gain in the tax rate - they didn't actually go up at all in a year that the market was up 30% (the year after the tax savings selling took place).

This shows massive levels of selling in 2012.  Exactly what I am predicting would be the case now.

I think you are one of those people that think the high income tax rates after WWII when the rest of the industrialized world was destroyed and we were the only industrial country still standing and producing for the entire planet - that the growth was a result of high tax rates and not the reality that we didn't have any competition in rebuilding literally the entire planet and the entire planet was buying hand-over-fist from the USA.

The rising cap gains rates in 2013 caused the market in 2012 to suffer and brought forward much selling in 2012 to avoid the higher tax rates in 2013.

And knowing and understanding both the market and our economy from 2009 to that point and the muted market returns, very slow economy-wide recovery from the recession - that the market was destined to start to work again as our economy finally reached parity with the pre-crisis era.

If there is going to be a high risk of Cap Gain rates increasing by 40% over current for high income people - you will see stocks being sold at far higher levels than normal in Q4 of 2024.  This is just what people do that wisely manage their finances - and when facing far higher tax costs, people react in a manner that is going to limit their tax costs and lower their own personal gains.",positive

If this it is the viewpoint of Bernie and people who vote for him that capital gain taxed should be higher. He should mention this, he should be vocal about this. That is what representation in democracy is about.   

What people here are proposing is since Harris is better than Trump just be silent about what you want. That could lead to a race to the bottom.

"Any progressive refusing to vote for Kamala because she isn’t perfect is doing more harm than good. There’s plenty of time to push for progressive policies over the next 4 years.

If Trump wins, everyone else loses.",positive
"I hope this gets through to the 'all or nothing' progressives that progress, even if tempered by pragmatism, is still better than no progress (or worse, a reversal of progress made). Not holding my breath though.",positive
"I love Bernie can’t believe he won’t ever be president, he would have done his upmost for you guys.",positive
"This is what I love about Sanders. He's been an idealist his whole life, but it never gets in the way of his pragmatism.",positive
The title is a backhanded compliment. Not a flex.,positive
"She’s not progressive, only seemingly so by comparison.  Thankfully most of the policies that would benefit people  right now are actually just moderate ones (though MAGA will undoubtedly squawk about how extremely leftist they all are)",positive

These comments that Sanders made actually are giving the Republicans lots of firepower against her. They view her as a 'chameleon' that lacks any clear policies.,positive

"Not that she wants this broadcast, but her Senate voting record was to the left of Warren. 

I think she and Walz are a brand of pragmatic progressives that I really like.",positive
"I see people like Harris or Biden as the type who will actually get more than done than Bernie because they are more willing to compromise. If Bernie were president, it’s not like he can avoid political reality or out maneuver the Republican Party. Thats why I’ve never really cared to support Bernie. He’s a good guy of course.",positive
"They still improved on their numbers though.

But it's a joke that Trump didn't lose with the same share Le Pen did on 2017 AND 22.",positive
And then the liberals shanked them lol,positive
"Okay, but then what happened after that? That's right, the left got screwed over.",negative
"How so? He endorsed Biden this year, and [in 2020](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/04/13/politics/bernie-sanders-endorses-joe-biden), [Hillary in 2016](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2016/07/11/politics/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders), and [Obama in 2008](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna586556).

“Pragmatic progressive” is my favorite flavor.,positive
"pragmatic progressives need to be in office, we can't afford to elect some pie in the sky type and have them fall flat. I don't want to worry about another outbreak of the MAGA brain eating virus.",positive
"According to Voteview, of the 109 Dems who served in the Senate since 2000, Harris is 2/109. Only behind Warren.",neutral
Multi party vs two party. And they don’t have our messed up electoral college. So it’s not really easy to make a comparison.,positive
"> They still improved on their numbers though.

Obviously, their goal wasn't to change Nartional Rally's popularity. It was solely to prevent them from a majority in Parliament. It's a resounding victory for French democracy.",positive

He really didn’t want to endorse Hillary. His wife was also retweeting anti Clinton stuff nonstop.,positive

"Tankies hate him dude. Even some ""progressives"" hate him.",negative
">They are saying your starting offer is “all”, then you compromise down.  

Starting a negotiation with an unreasonable demand is exactly how you get people to immediately cease to take you seriously.",negative
making the starting offer be “all” is a good way to run up the score along the pacific coast but make her be unelectable to the eyes of many rust belt voters she has to win over,positive
">Maybe if you stopped attacking a straw man

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/biden-progressives-immigration/index.html

Such critics exist, so not really a straw man then, is it?

>If your opening offer is already compromised down, you’ll end with even less after the  compromise.  That isn’t pragmatic.  That’s cowardice and stupidity. 

Let's address the things Sanders brought up: banning fracking and pushing for Medicare For All. Those are not currently politically tenable or achievable. So yeah, reversing positions on that is absolutely the right decision.

>Centrist start halfway to Republicans and then negotiate further right.  Progressives argue you start where you want to be and compromise right from there.  

I'm specifically referring to progressives who are criticizing Harris for not going left enough even if doing so is a politically impossibility if one wants to win the election",negative
What are the three biggest compromises made by the “all” crowd?,neutral
That's not what I remember,neutral
"If Trump's acceptance speech at the RNC was identical to Kamala's, liberals will be in an absolute uproar about how authoritarian and right-wing wing it is. But apparently blue fascism is on the menu and it's perfectly palatable",positive
She’s a candidate that should appeal to both Sanders *and* Clinton supporters.,positive
Do what? Reach gridlock in Congress? Have things be overturned by federalist scotus? Do we really think she’s going to start official acting all sorts of amazing shit? Nah bro she’s gonna play ball with her overlords. That’s where the money is. That’s what keeps their ball moving. ,positive
"I saw it on one of those political charts that wasn't specifically about her, rather you could plot any Senators against one another. I can't find the link at a glance, but it wasn't like an article that was specifically about her but from a tool that could be applied to anyone.",negative
"Per an article from the hill last month, from her first tenure in the Senate through today, Harris is the second most liberal senator of this century, per the Voteview project out of UCLA, only coming in behind Warren. 

She ranks 2nd out of the 109 Democratic senators since 2000.",neutral
"May it last longer than the ""compassionate conservative""",positive
"I mean the ""pie in the sky"" types would be pragmatic if enough of them were elected... It's like all those people who say we need a larger majority of dems for dems to actually do more substantial stuff; the same applies to progressives. 

Any political position is ""pie in the sky"" if they're the minority.",positive
"Absolutely correct.  Get some progressive wins on the board, the small stuff that's actually easily doable.  Prove to voters that the sky wont' fall with progressive policies in place, and you can then lead them onto bigger and more ambitious goals.",positive
"It is, but France and all of Europe should make collective effort to destroy their fascist parties.",negative
"Jane is not Bernie, she is her own woman.",neutral
"I don't think tankie is an accurate description, but there is definitely a portion of the left that honestly likes to complain more than they like to actually get things done. Which I think stems from them having some really poor understanding of how progress actually gets done. It's like people think if you can't overnight get everything you want then it's not even worth trying at all",positive
"Refresh your memory then, he campaigned like hell for her",negative
"Calling it ""blue fascism"" while the Republican Party is literally campaigning on throwing the military at political opponents and putting millions of people in camps is a bit disingenuous.",positive
Lol what was even remotely authoritarian or fascist about the DNC?,negative
"I think Walz kind of nails the messaging (although their stances are aligned). Do the thing that's the most neighborly, and do it pragmatically. Keep it simple and common sense. 

That happens to be fairly progressive with some frequency, but also some (not all, mind you) progressives are not in favor of incremental change or taking it one issue at a time. And like, there's a lot of stuff that needs to be made better and I understand the desire to make it all better all at once. But the system isn't really built for that and people by and large don't like meteoric shifts and won't vote for them. 

I've been really refreshed by her ability to voice progressive policy without just declaring that we're going to change everything and also the set of things she wants to change are a set of things where there's an actionable plan to get it done.",positive
"As a Bernie supporter who voted for Clinton while holding my nose, I'm a lot more excited to vote for Harris. Especially because she's backed by Walz, who really reminds me of Bernie's ethic of doing what's right",positive
"if you think that's possible, you misunderstand that dynamic entirely",neutral
I feel like I haven’t heard that term in decades.,positive
"Who do you think is involved in grassroots organizing vs just voting every 4 or maybe 2 years? That's pretty rich buddy, thanks for pulling all the dead weight with your precious vote",positive
"I wouldn't include Bernie in this. He has been broadly supportive of the Biden/Harris presidency and will continue to be so for the Harris/Waltz (if they, God willing, win).

He hasn't acted like an arsonist and has helped in getting policy to be passed.",positive

"Sane Republicans should be the first in line to vote for her. 

Like her or hate her, Harris will still be gone in four to eight years. The stench of electing the first convicted felon to the White House, however, will haunt the Republican party for ages to come.  Remain the party of Lincoln or be known forever as the party of Trump? You decide.",neutral
"If Harris can't get RW voters to recognize the facts that Trump is a rapist, a traitor, and a lifelong criminal, she sure as hell can't win the support from those who call themselves ""undecided.""

Other than the shameless hypocrites who call themselves Evangelicals, how can anyone honestly call themselves undecided when these despicable truths (and more) about Trump are irrefutable?",negative

If you elect Donald Trump, that's what you're going to get, possibly *for the rest of your lives*.

"Patriotic Americans need to vote for Harris, no matter what political affiliation. We need to vote for the best person to do the job. This time it has to be pretty clear, she is best qualified. Voting by party line does not always give us the best person. The Republican Party is controlled by an evil family defrauding donors of their money by backing a candidate that is on bail as a convicted criminal, facing  jail time plus additional charges for his criminal enterprises. We need the best qualified, not outlaws. America needs patriots to vote for the best choices we have been given.",positive
Everyone who's not a Fascist or billionaire should back Harris. Full stop. ,positive

When Biden was in the race I saw one poll that had 20% of voters as undecided. 75% of those were undecided between Biden and staying home. There are more people in that camp still than we realize and I'm hopeful as election day nears they realize that Trump can't win again and will come out and vote for Harris.,negative

I’m pretty sure if they have hard proof Trump is a pedophile and his guys Epstein was giving him his fix. Magas will still vote for him. They will say that it’s lies and AI generated.

It’s fucking messed up.,positive

"The polls generally favor Harris, but they are almost all close enough to be with the margin of error, and Trump has a huge advantage built in thanks to the Electoral College. But it's pretty pointless to get worked up about minor swings in the polls that clearly are not based on anything that's happening with the campaigns, because the election is going to be close no matter what. Trump absolutely can win, and that really should be all the motivation anyone who cares about the future of the country needs to get out and vote.",positive
"I'm one of those. I'm likely not voting for a president this year, only going for local elections. Not once has anyone acknowledged complaints against Harris, and complaints against Biden were only acknowledged after the debate, when it became convenient to criticize him. It's not helping that any democrats I talk to seem to have zero communications skills beyond telling us to piss off. 

And I'm not talking about just online interatctions. I talked to some representatives on the local democrat party yesterday at an event and they just looked annoyed when I brought up my issues. I live in a red state, so I got the feeling they were just trying to get rid of me, thinking I was a republican. I'm a former democrat btw. They gave my kids some nice stickers though.",negative

Calling trump hitler means nothing to us. To us it's a fairly weak propaganda tactics with Russian ties. Because guess what, the Russians have been calling their enemies, mostly  political dissidents and political opposition, Nazis since 1941. 

The stakes are pretty much nothing, because we are going down the same path with either choice. Ever since I was a boy, we were taught to vote for the lesser of two evils. Well that only ends at the same place, just at different times. I'm tired of the lesser of two evils, and would rather burn it all down and start again.

 This sub is the only political group I am active on. I'm not even right wing. I mostly interact with left wing media and groups. I have valid concerns. Having those concerns are not a qanon conspiracy. There are people who replied to me saying if trump wins there is going to be a race war and an active genocide. That's the bluanon conspiracy you should be worried about, and that's one of my concerns. 

And if you are still concerned, I am fully vaccinated. My daughter was one of the first children in the country become vaccinated against covid, as she was part of the trial for infants and babies. My wife has administered thousands of vaccinations over the years. I've never voted for a Republican in a general election. One of my groups is about making fun of boomer conspiracy nuts.

Lgbtq people who will lose their livelihoods when their rights are sent back a century. Or women who have to have secret, back alley abortions and end up dying.

"I'm speaking metaphorically. I care about my country and don't want to see it fall apart, but I don't see a future where things improve. The idea of compromise seems completely dead, and with it, any hope for unity. The divisions that have been growing over the last 20 years only get worse with time. History has shown us that countries in this state rarely survive for long, and I believe we're already witnessing the early signs of collapse.

I'd prefer to watch from a distance rather than be part of the kindling, if that makes sense. My ancestors were victims of genocide by the United States, and I don't foresee a repeat of that on a large scale. Maybe isolated acts of political violence, like the occasional suicide attacker, but not widespread attacks. Most conservatives I know won't stand for unprovoked attacks against minorities.

Perhaps the best way I could have worded that was, I've come to accept that it is already burning down.",negative

Republicans refuse to elaborate on the candidates failures and that goes for the democrats as well, and her you are coming at me for how I spell.

Do you even acknowledge that their are legitimate concerns about Harris and the current state of the party?

Edit 2: This is the second time in this thread that my spelling and vocabulary are called into question as some sort of purity check and that's just bizarre.

"Imagine a train is barrelling down a track you're standing next to, which splits into two separate tracks at the pull of a lever. After the split, each separate track has a number of people tied to it (You may have seen this before).

The outcomes appear binary; the train goes down one track or the other, bad stuff happens to the people tied on that track. You however, as the bystander, could simply not make the choice either way, not pull the lever, and you're not at fault, right?

Not exactly. You're aware of the situation. You're aware of the lever. You're aware of the consequences, and which option is worse. Non-participarion when you're *aware of the outcome* is inherently acceptance of the outcome, and therefore participation in it. If the worse outcome happens because you *deliberately* didn't pull the lever when you *could have*, you caused that outcome.",negative

Well you were pretty ambiguous on “what this country is turning into.” So you go ahead and expand on that and we can have an actual discussion.,positive
"Well I could try to enlighten you a bit since I had a front row seat to it due to my job.  At least on the food side, you had a couple things happen at the same time that just absolutely sent food prices to the stratus sphere.  One, both railroads and steam lines took Covid as an opportunity to raise their rates by unprecedented levels.  Steam lines took shipping costs from $1,500 per container to over $19,000/container nearly overnight, on a 20 ton container you are looking at additional $875/ton in just shipping costs.  Steam lines aren’t based in US, so they aren’t subject to US pricing laws/gouging.

Railroads had started a major workforce reduction prior to Covid with PSR and doubled down on it during COVID, thereby causing delays of weeks or even months, and of course jacked up rates to the moon.  Since almost all non-produce travels via rail at some point in its life cycle, obviously this caused significant price runs ups.  Over the next 6 months food prices will come down rapidly, the wholesale ingredient prices have already collapsed and it take about 6 months to clean out retail inventory.  Food factories are running wide open again and they are only profitable at full capacity, so if price is too high and you risk a plant shut down, you will drop your prices.

Food production is also very right sized.  Meaning, you typically build capacity based on average population demand.  Also during Covid, people started mass hoarding which the system is not designed to support, as it only produces X per week of capacity.

The US is a very over producing nation when it comes to food, and cheap food is still the government mandate.  Unfortunately, Biden didn’t fire JPow when he had the chance and JPow kept his foot on the gas 9 months longer than he should have with QE, adding way too much $$$ coupled with stimulus programs.",positive

"First off, the ""trolley problem"" isn't always the same. Not always a baby, different numbers of people, etc. Believe it or not, the trolley can even be a train!

Second, that doesn't matter at all. The principle matters. I presented a hypothetical situation as a metaphor in response to what you said. The hypothetical had two options, one of which is worse than the other.

""Ask yourself why participate into a corrupt system when your participation indicates acceptance?"" Your words.

In the hypothetical, you're still participating in the outcome even though you didn't make a choice, *because you were aware of what effect your decision would have.* In real life, in the election, you're still participating in the ""corrupt system"" by choosing not to vote, because you're *aware of what effect your decision will have.*

"Labour won because the conservatives imploded and fractured into two parties to split the vote, and labour achieved a landslide with less votes than they had in the last election because of it.

Like, there is no equivalence here.",positive
Labour won because the Conservatives were in complete collapse and had three leaders in two years. American Democrats' opponent has a cult following that will support him no matter what. The party that said losing Muslim votes was good because they're fleas shouldn't advise anyone. A party with a tenuous minority vote.,positive

"> “For Harris, addressing core issues such as housing, prices and job creation could also win over undecided US middle-class voters, many of whom face similar economic pressures. Labour set about finding out as much as possible about these voters and applying that knowledge to all aspects of campaigning.

> “They were patriotic, they were family oriented, they were struggling with the cost of living: squeezed working-class voters who wanted change.”

The current US Democratic Party is incapable of doing this.  There is an article right now on this sub's frontpage where all the comments continue to simply deny, deny, deny, deny that are any serious economic problems at all, and that anyone who complains is a loser whiner.

These loser whiners are going to give the election to Trump.  And it's the fault of Democratic leadership whose core belief is refusal to listen to others, even censoring such opinions so they don't have to hear them.",negative
"Also, the Labor party didn't even receive the majority, but rather a plurality with 33.7% of the vote. The fact that they have 410 seats in the House of Commons is demonstrative of the UK election system needing an overhaul.

"It's weird because I'm seeing the exact opposite happening myself. From Harris' own speeches to like every comment I see is about the Democratic plan to fix the issues that Trump created, and explaining in detail exactly how Biden's administration was better for the middle and lower classes, plus the reports I've seen multiple about 16 Novel Laureate Economists who have each separately released their findings that Trump's policies will increase inflation more than Harris' will, plus the policy information on Harris' official page detailing out exactly how she'll help those families in need rather than giving tax cuts to the super rich like trump did and wants to again.

"Hey pal,

I was right there with you. I loved fox. Watched it every day with mom when I moved back home after college.

Fox news (and other similar shows) and a LOT of social media content is very biased. JUST like how there's a lot of biased liberal content as well.

I kept getting in fights with my fiance at the time, who was liberal and watched CNN. We compromised and agreed that I would stop watching Fox if he would stop watching CNN. We researched, and found the most neutral, fact-based journalistic sites (AP, Reuters, and BBC) and those were the only things we could get our news from.

Funny enough, after a while we stopped fighting about politics. Turns out we had a lot more in common than we thought. We were just getting information from the wrong places. Places that tried to make us angry at the other side.

I say this because I hear a lot of the same things I used to say in what you were mentioning. I was really upset at what seemed to be an unfair shake.

But I think most of us already know that our news sources aren't accurate. We're just addicted to the entertainment and outrage--it feels GOOD to be mad, because it makes us feel RIGHT.

But I suspect that you care enough about this country, because you posted this. You've got red white and blue blood just like me. And you already know the right thing to do. Quit half-assing such an important civic duty. Countless Americans made the ultimate sacrifice so we could be free. Don't squander that sacrifice on chuckles and rage bait, designed to pit us against each other.

We're better than that.

Look up the arguments against BOTH candidates. And then look up the evidence to support those arguments (again, on both sides). If you think you're right about your preferred candidate, you still owe it to your country to be able to make your case and defend your choice, just like the brave men and women who died defending you.",positive

"> The fact that they have 410 seats in the House of Commons is demonstrative of the UK election system needs an overhaul.

Its similar to the system in the US, with FPTP (winner takes all), but at least in UK they know it sucks and have tried to mess with it to open some room for other parties to exist.

Altough it should be scrapped (just like it should in the US)",positive

"I want to raise awareness for the Carter Center, which has nearly eradicated the guinea worm!

For anyone who doesn't know someone can contract guinea worms from drinking contaminated water. At that point the eggs hatch inside of you, the worms grow a bit and mate, and then you poop out the dead males. The pregnant female(s), however, burrow down into your leg, the whole time releasing a pain killer so you don't feel pain. Eventually a blister forms, and she stops releasing any pain-killers, it burns like crazy and the instinctual response is to dip the leg in water as it offers relief. At this point the pregnant female worm pokes her little wormy head out of the blister and vomits her eggs into the water.

To get them out of your leg is a challenge. You can't just rip, if the worm gets ripped in half you'll have half a dead worm in your leg and need to have it surgically removed. Nope, solution is to wrap the worm around a stick, rolling it a bit more each day until the entire worm finally comes out; they can be up to 2.5ft long. 

Prevention is as simple as having filtered water, but in places like Africa that can be a luxury. And the cost is high, people miss weeks of work suffering in agony as they slowly get this worm out of their leg, the pain is said to be quite intense, and many people have multiple worms.

When the Carter Center first began its targeting of the guinea worm in 1986 there were 3.56 million cases every year. In 2023 there were only 13 cases. Carter once said his dream was to outlive the guinea worm (as a species), he may not quite make it but he's damn close.

"Iran was an issue where he basically took a middle of the road approach that was the worst of both worlds

Basically, when trouble started brewing in Iran, he had two advisors pushing him in two different directions. One wanted Carter to support the Shah in cracking down on dissidents. The other wanted Carter to pressure the Shah to make reforms to try and act as a release valve for some of the dissident energy and bring some of the less radical dissidents into the system rather than opposing it. Rather than decisively picking one of those two routes, he went with a weak attempt to do a little of both mixed with caution, which led to the Shah taking a less conciliatory stance towards dissidents but without the backing for this to really work",negative

">Today [September 3rd], the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced over $11 million in grants to support the recruitment and retention of bilingual and multilingual educators and provide high quality programming to Native students in an effort to strengthen and revitalize Native American languages.  
...  
This announcement comes as Secretary Cardona is embarking on his 2024 Back to School Bus Tour with stops in Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. This year’s theme, “Fighting for Public Education,” highlights how school communities are using the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic investments in public education to implement evidence-based strategies, accelerate academic success, and support student well-being. The 2024 Bus Tour will celebrate public education as the American system that opened the door for so many of our nation’s success stories—from astronauts to astrophysicists, writers to engineers, musicians to mathematicians, innovative entrepreneurs in the private sector to great leaders in the public sector.  
...  
Today’s announcements include $7.5 million in 13 new awards in the National Professional Development program (NPD) to support educators of English learners. The NPD program provides grants to eligible institutions of higher education and public or private entities, in consortia with states or local educational agencies, to implement professional development activities that will improve language instruction for English learners. The program currently serves 94 entities throughout the nation. This 2024 cohort represents the first set of grantees under a new absolute priority to increase the number of bilingual or multilingual teachers through a Grow-Your-Own (GYO) pre-service program that recruits teacher candidates who are bilingual or multilingual.

>Of the 13 entities funded, there are two Hispanic Serving Institutions, one Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution, and one Native American-Serving Nontribal Institution. In addition, all entities have indicated their commitment to serving students from first-generation students and/or students from low-income backgrounds.

>The Department projects that these grantees will serve approximately 3,700 participants across nine states in four languages: Navajo, Sm'álgyax, Spanish, and Ute.  
...  
The Department also announced $3.7 million in grant funding for the Native American Language (NAL@ED) projects. A major emphasis of this program is to fund partial and full immersion programs, in addition to developing new or expanding existing language programs. There are over 200 tribal communities without living speakers making this critical funding even more important for the revitalization of Native American languages. In 2020, the Oneida Immersion School, featured on the bus tour, received a NAL@ED award to serve 434 elementary students as part of their Language Nest Expansion Project (LNEP).

>The 12 NAL@ED grants will serve students across seven states. Projects will support language revitalization i: Lakota, Tlingit, Numu, Cherokee, Yup’ik, Maskoke Seminole, Diné Bizaad (central, western, and eastern dialects), Unangam Tunuu, Northern Paiute, and Western Shoshoni. Grantees will engage in a number of projects for native language revitalization, including developing proficiency benchmarks, hosting virtual cultural language summits, and summer immersion institutes.  
...

List of recipients for this latest round of funding is in the press release. Statement from U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona:

>“Being multilingual is a superpower—a powerful asset that can connect students to their identity and culture, and gives those who speak more than one language cognitive, social, and economic benefits,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, “The investments we’re announcing today advance our goal of providing every student in America with a pathway to multilingualism by supporting the recruitment, preparation, and retention of amazing bilingual and multilingual educators—some of the best teachers in our nation, period. They also support the revitalization of Native American languages, a reflection of this Administration’s commitment to Tribal sovereignty and consultation in education.”",positive

">The Biden-Harris Administration believes that public education is the bedrock of our democracy and the foundation of opportunity in our country—and that every young person should have the chance to learn, grow, and pursue their dreams. Since Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has focused on improving academic achievement, increasing student attendance and engagement, and building communities where all students feel they belong and can thrive. That’s why the Biden-Harris Administration made the single-largest investment in K-12 education in history—and it is delivering results, including student achievement gains. A Harvard and Stanford study, for example, for example, examined outcomes in districts that received large amounts of federal COVID-19 relief funding, which ranged from approximately $4,000 to more than $13,000 per student, and found that these investments will pay for itself in increased earnings for students who benefit, with particularly large impacts for students in schools with high rates of poverty. These investments not only improve academic achievement, but other student outcomes. Another economic study shows that a 10% increase in per student spending each year for all 12 years of public school leads to about 7% higher wages in adulthood, with more pronounced effects for students from low-income backgrounds.
 
>As students across the country head back to school, the Biden-Harris Administration is working to make sure America’s schools have the resources and supports they need to continue their important progress. Working together, at the federal, state, and local level, we must all double-down on strengthening reading and math skills; increasing student attendance and engagement; providing afterschool and expanded learning programs; and increasing access to intensive tutoring. We must also provide teachers and school leaders with evidence-based preparation, development, coaching, and resources to support student academic success and literacy and math and their overall well-being, which is foundational to that success.

The following is an abridged list of additional Administrative actions to support student success, more on each in the press release:

>* Awarding $149 million to support states in implementing evidence-based reading interventions, including efforts to ensure every child is reading fluently by third grade.
* Awarding $30 million to support comprehensive assessment systems that inform teaching and support learning.
* Issuing new school improvement guidance focused on evidence-based practices to support students and educators and accelerate academic achievement.
* Releasing a new resource for educators on evidence-based strategies for increasing student literacy and math achievement.
* To support states, districts, schools, and families in addressing chronic absenteeism and increase student engagement, the Administration is:
* Calling on Governors and state education leaders to create statewide student data systems that provide chronic absenteeism-related data for all schools that are actionable, help target interventions, and drive improvement.
* Calling on industry vendors that provide student information systems to improve the availability and utility of student attendance data.
* To support these efforts, this year, the Department of Education will issue a resource for state leaders highlighting different state approaches to creating and implementing data systems to address chronic absenteeism along with recommendations for states and local leaders.
* Founding the *Student Attendance and Engagement Solutions Network*
* Releasing a joint resource by the U.S. Departments of Education and Transportation highlighting ways to provide safe, reliable transit options to get young people to and from school and support everyday student attendance.
* Releasing, this month, a joint resource for parents by the U.S. Departments of Education and Agriculture on how healthy school meals support regular attendance.
* Launching the “Attendance Champions Challenge” to hear directly from young people on creative solutions to address chronic absenteeism.
* Providing parents with resources on navigating whether to send kids to school when they are experiencing health symptoms.

These new actions build on previous Administrative actions:

>* **Securing $130 billion for the largest-ever investment in public education through state and district funding in the American Rescue Plan (ARP).** ARP has been used to help schools safely reopen, and address the academic, mental health, and other needs of students. ARP funding has put more teachers in our classrooms and more support staff in our schools; expanded high-dosage tutoring; led to record expansion of summer and after-school programs; improved HVAC systems; and increased access to a wide range of student supports. The most recent data shows that states and districts have allocated more than $70 billion to activities that address students’ academic, social, and emotional needs, including tutoring, afterschool, and summer learning, and research is showing that these investments are working. 
* **Enabling states to continue investing pandemic relief funds into academic achievement efforts in the 2024-25 school year and focus remaining resources on improving outcomes.** The Department issued a letter, Frequently Asked Questions, and a template to support States and provide a critical pathway to continue to use ARP dollars in the 2024-2025 school year, including on evidence-based academic and other student supports. 
* **Fully enforcing the ARP maintenance of equity provisions to ensure that States maintain their own levels of education spending, especially for communities with high rates of poverty.** Under the Department’s robust implementation of these fiscal equity provisions, 48 States, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia safeguarded funding in communities with high rates of poverty and drove almost $800 million to under-resourced schools.",positive

When Covid faded, the checks stopped and people slowly went back to work. The number of jobs ""created"" jumped and Biden's employment numbers went way up. 

Of course, the myth here is that people weren't working at all and were staying home with their government checks. These are not new jobs being created; these were simply jobs replacing the huge drop off caused by Covid and the government checks.

"Gender affirming care for minors includes therapy, counseling, and usually a social transition—new clothes, a new name and pronouns. 

Sometimes puberty blockers, which were already given to cis children who go through puberty too early. Why pick and choose who gets to have this care? If it’s safe enough for cis children, it’s safe enough for trans children. The nice thing about puberty blockers is if they do end up realizing they’re not trans, their puberty will continue as normal. But it saves trans men from having to have a mastectomy surgery later, allows their voices to drop naturally and can allow them to reach physical heights that they would have been more likely to be if they were cis. (My dad is 6’4 and I’m 5’10, the same height as most of the women in my family, and I know if I had a testosterone based puberty I’d be at least 6’ but most likely 6’2-6’4.) Trans women wouldn’t have to pay for vocal cord surgery or have to put on an unnatural voice every day because people are disrespectful to women with deep voices, they wouldn’t have to deal with the whole “trans women are naturally advantaged/stronger than cis women” in sports debate because they wouldn’t have had a testosterone based puberty, and they would have less dysphoria regarding their height/body shape. 

While some cases surgery may be on the table, there’s still a double standard when it comes to trans kids when cis kids are able to get the same surgeries. Remember that surgery would come after years of therapy in most cases, I’m sure someone can find a case or three where they didn’t have all of those checks and balances in place but they are very very very rare and the result of terrible doctors, not the trans community.

Also, gender affirming surgeries have a less than 1% regret rate. Compare that to knee replacement surgeries, something I have personally seen change someone’s life so dramatically in a positive way, which has roughly a 30% regret rate.

Gynecomastia correction is usually the most common “gender affirming” care performed on minors. Cis people generally just don’t realize that they do things that affirm their genders all the time without realizing that’s what they’re doing. There’s virtually no difference between this and a trans boy having a mastectomy. 

I’m not for things like implants, but then again I’m not for those for cis teens either and I never see anybody talk about that when it comes to minors having surgery. 

I also feel like it’s hypocritical (in general, not you specifically) to be anti gender affirming care for minors when circumcision, which is a genital surgery performed on young males usually within hours of their arrival to the world, is so common in the US. I hear the hygiene argument but we went on for millennia without circumcising and especially in the modern day have the tools and resources to teach kids to clean themselves well.

At least a trans teenager gets to actually choose what happens with their body, I have ex partners who really resent their parents for circumcising them for one reason or another. I don’t think it’s that uncommon but men rarely publicly talk about it. My sister expressed regret in getting my nephew circumcised like six months after he was born because she felt pressured into it by the hospital staff. Ideally  she would have done enough research beforehand to have made that decision before she was giving birth, but I can’t really fault her on that because no single person ever has all of the answers. I have intersex friends who had doctors and parents decide what genitals they should have for them without consent and resent but I’m not well versed on the topic so don’t feel comfortable giving a lot of details. 

And I’m not saying those should continue, I’m just wondering where the outrage is? Trans kids at the very least WANT the care. 

I just genuinely believe it should be a decision between the kid, their parents, and their doctors, not every cis person in america who doesn’t understand what we are going through. 

I didn’t want to throw a bunch of articles at you nor do I expect to really change your mind, but for the fence sitters who maybe feel like they don’t know enough to have an opinion — the trans kids, their parents, and their doctors have a lot more experience with this and know more about what they’re going through than any google search or reddit thread is going to teach you.

What surgeries are cis kids getting that trans kids cannot?

Because cis children are on them because of a medical diagnosis. Trans kids are dealing with a mental issue. Treat the mental issue first.

Cis people generally just don’t realize that they do things that affirm their genders all the time without realizing that’s what they’re doing.

There is a world of difference between a biological male taking fat off their chest and a biological minor female removing their breasts from their chest, which if they ever regret the decision and have children will not have a choice to breastfeed them.

>I’m not for things like implants, but then again I’m not for those for cis teens either and I never see anybody talk about that when it comes to minors having surgery.

Not aware of too many kids getting implants. I also am not a fan. Wait until they're adults.

I chalk this up to a cultural norm in the US, my son gets it cause I did and so on. I have not heard anyone regretting they got one though.

"I’m on mobile so can’t format the same readable way you are, my apologies. I like to write :)

The first paragraph—you specifically said you don’t believe in gender affirming treatment or care for minors, and I was elaborating on what gender affirming care actually means and includes because I think a lot of people just jump to hormones and surgery. For minors there will be years of the other stuff that the parents can get on their own but really should be a specialty and something covered under insurance because gender nonconforming and trans children deserve to be taken seriously. This is currently the case but as someone from Florida who was directly at 26 years old affected by the trans healthcare ban while I was already transitioning, it is a really slippery slope from “minors can’t have gender affirming care so they have to skirt around regulations to get the therapy and healthcare they need” to nobody can have gender affirming care and we have to go to the dark web or the same type of doctor that got my mom hooked on opioids in the 00s to access 

I’m exaggerating in the end there, and especially at this point in time don’t see it getting that bad, but desants took a millimeter and ran for miles until the lawyers stopped him and real lives were affected by these bans. I know people who exclusively get their hormones on the dark web, and I dont know any personally but there are absolutely minors who are already doing that. Why not allow them to get it safely from a medical professional? 

Gender dysphoria is a medical diagnosis just as much as gynecomastia is. The only effective cure or treatment for it is transitioning. Many people who “detransition” don’t fully transition back to their birth gender but fall under the nonbinary umbrella. Most of us in the trans community consider nonbinary folks trans because they still don’t identify as their birth gender. This is why puberty blockers are great,  because they don’t change anything. They just delay it. 

Onto the double standards —

I have ADHD, probably genetic but I’m the first in my family to get diagnosed. The medication developed for adhd has one of the highest rates of success as far as treatment goes for mental illnesses. It still won’t ever cure it, however, and if I want to maintain the level of stability I have right now I will have to take those meds for the rest of my life. Over time I’ll probably have to change meds and adjust my doses. The years I couldn’t access my meds due to a number of reasons were socially and financially disasterous for me. 

It’s not like depression or general anxiety that could eventually be cured and gotten over with the right treatment, but it is still a mental illness, and while it won’t kill me, neither will a bit of extra breast tissue kill a teenaged boy. But they can have gynecomastia surgery to remove breast tissue that develops due to a hormone imbalance, so why not a trans boy who has breast tissue due to essentially a hormone imbalance?

Since the treatment for gender dysphoria often ends with the person taking HRT, we are essentially fixing a hormone imbalance by replacing the hormone we were born to produce more of with the hormone that aligns with our gender identity. It’s the same issue in a different flavor. 

That is why it’s a double standard. There is not a difference between a 17 year old male child having breast tissue (gynecomastia is breast tissue caused by excess estrogen, not just fat) removed and a 17 year old female to male child having breast tissue caused by estrogen removed, unless you’re assuming that child will regret doing it because they’re not actually trans. And again, 1% regret rate should be enough to verify that it’s simply not an issue. 

I’m sick of people saying we need to wait for more data to come out. Trans people have been around for centuries, we have been medically transitioning for decades in america and very few people cared before, we are just being brought into the spotlight now by bad actors. 

Just because you haven’t heard of something doesn’t mean it exists. If you have male friends you trust to be vulnerable with you, ask around and see what you hear. Maybe I just got an abundance of them around me. I was a girlfriend when my ex told me that but I don’t think he’s ever told his friends. 

Why should some people’s frankly uneducated opinions and fear affect the lives of people they will never meet or interact with just because they don’t like how that group of people uses something everyone else gets access to? 

There are already checks and balances protecting those kids, between their parents and many different medical departments they’ll touch between their PCP, therapist, psychiatrist,  endocrinologists and eventually a surgeon. There are far too many hands in the bucket for much abuse these days. 

I’m 28 and still have to get two therapy letters for my insurance and the surgeon to get my mastectomy, and I have the BRCA gene so I’m a cancer risk 🙃 And this is in NH, where I moved since FL’s GAC ban, not a red state. 

If a parent is gonna make their kid sick for attention, that’s munchausen’s by proxy, and they’re gonna abuse them another way if they don’t have access to gender affirming care. Same for the doctors. A gender affirming care ban wouldn’t stop any abuse, it would just make the abusive and manipulative people change their plans to something else.",negative
">I’m on mobile so can’t format the same readable way you are, my apologies. I like to write :)

Just highlight the text you are responding too and hit quote :)

I think that is part of the issue with this discourse. Many on the right who are anti GAC are simply against any surgeries that will effect the child for life. I'm sure there are some who are anti all care but there is no reason why a trans kid should not be able to get therapy or anything else short of surgery covered by insurance. HRT is where a lot of people draw the line. I am sure not many realize how it all works within the body, including myself so I appreciate the information.

As far as your double standards. If a trans kid is 17 and wants surgery they can wait until they are 18, just like a kid who wants a tattoo, or to gamble. It's a part of life, you have to be an adult to do certain things.

Also as a man myself I can say with almost certainty that not many who have been circumcised have given any thought into if they were not.

I'll ask what I hope is a thought provoking question.

A 12 year old boy loves running, he is very good at it but constantly falling just short of winning medals at meets. He's watching the paralympics right now. He thinks to himself ""wow, those prosthetic legs look really cool and those guys are so fast. I want one and I can race against other amputees. I think I'll have a shot to win then."" He now identifies as an amputee. Should he be able to have his leg amputated? At 12 years old? How about at 16? 

>There are already checks and balances protecting those kids, between their parents and many different medical departments they’ll touch between their PCP, therapist, psychiatrist, endocrinologists and eventually a surgeon. There are far too many hands in the bucket for much abuse these days.

This is great to hear, I hope it's true. It's nice to read things like this instead of the typical shouting across the aisle.",positive
"For some reason iOS only copies the whole comment :(

The nice thing about your thought provoking question is that there are already checks and balances in place for that 12 year old who might want their legs cut off, checks and balances you seem to agree with me are in place and good, and you and I both know that there’s a huge difference between a 12 year old and a 16/17 year old. So you’re saying the 16/17 year old cis boys should also wait for gynecomastia correction, is that correct? Since they don’t have to at this point, neither should trans kids. If we want to ban certain surgeries under 18 it needs to be for everyone, not just trans kids. 

The breastfeeding thing always makes me laugh bc how many women do you know who breastfeed exclusively these days? I personally don’t want kids but always figured I would at the very least try breastfeeding if I were to end up changing my mind one day because of the benefits. I am very pro breastfeeding and think more mothers should do it and it’s a shame it’s kind of seen as taboo and weird to talk about.

Because of this, I have been so surprised to see that next to none of my friends who are having kids are breastfeeding. My mom, grandmas, sister and cousins have not breastfed ever and have told me they had no interest in it, or in grandmas’ cases they found it painful and decided to formula feed almost immediately after trying. My sister couldn’t latch. My best friend since high school who has 2 kids finds it gross. We had a pumping room for mother’s at the credit union I worked at and despite many pregnancies and new mothers working in that office, it was rarely used. I simply do not think it’s as big of an issue as people act like it is, and with a 1% regret rate it simply isn’t an issue for young trans men at all. 

I do know trans men who have kept their breasts until they finished having children and that’s super valid, but not every trans man will breastfeed, many more will not give birth ever by choice because as you know most men don’t give birth and for many of us it would cause extreme levels of dyscomfort and dysphoria. Becoming pregnant is a huge fear of a lot of young trans men. Either way, it should be our choice, not the government’s. 

Not to mention what nestle is doing to mothers in third world countries by convincing them their breast milk isn’t healthy for their kids and making them rely on formula for profit is a much bigger issue nobody seems to care about as much as they care about trans kids. 

I am very educated on these matters and there are real people, not hypothetical 12 year olds who want their legs cut off, being affected by these laws.",positive
"Hmm, I think a lot of women breastfeed, I know of at least a dozen who have had children within the past 5 years that have. Maybe not necessarily directly to the baby from their breasts but pumping is pretty normal. 

Yes the whole formula better for babies than breast milk is a wild concept. Many women fell for that in the US as well. Seems to be turning the other way.

I do not agree that a biological male should have to wait to get gynecomastia. He's not trying to change his biological gender. It is also not a life altering surgery for him. (May be life altering in sense of society norms, fitting in at school.) A biological female deciding to make a permanent change to her body before adulthood is different in my opinion. Same would go for a biological male wanting to have Vaginoplasty. Wait until they're adults.

You keep bringing up the 1% regret rate. Does that include trans people who have went through the process as children? I think it is to big of a decision for minors to make. Hell even someone under 25 probably shouldn't make that decision. I agree with all other care and am on the fence about HRT. 

I think it's wild that you cannot get a tattoo, rent a hotel room, buy cigarettes or alcohol, get a rental car, vote join military, take out a loan under 18. Yet you guys want kids to be able to have these invasion, non reversible surgeries.",positive

>\[VP\] Harris, contrary to jibes from Republicans desperate to justify voting against her, is no socialist. To the contrary, although she has rolled out an economic agenda reliant on an activist government to level the playing field and boost the middle class, she is to a larger degree than President Joe Biden attuned to the need for pro-growth policies to support entrepreneurialism.",positive
"Harris is by far the better candidate in this election year. Her policies are smart and targeting the right parts of the economy to create jobs and grow wealth for all, not just a few at the top.

Trump, on the other hand, is the absolute worst ever candidate. His past presidency killed millions of American with mismanagement of the pandemic and decimated a robust economy handed down to him from President Obama

The choice in this November is clear. Go vote and vote straight Blue so that Harris will be elected along with support in Congress and local governments so that her policies can be implemented.",positive

">Moreover, Harris promised in the housing market to cut red tape that slows development and to give tax breaks. CNN reported: “To spur construction, Harris would provide a first-ever tax incentive for builders who build starter homes sold to first-time buyers. She also would expand an existing tax incentive for building affordable rental housing and create a $40 billion fund for innovative housing construction.”

"Biden was an incredibly bad candidate.

Great legislator, and that’s where his talents end.

Horrible at communicating his accomplishments in a compelling way. It really felt like I barely heard from him for 4 years before the disastrous debate.

Never fully clearly communicating the chips act, the inflation reduction act, or why there was inflation to the average voter. Trump killed the border bill and he barely talked about it. It wasn’t until Harris brought it front and center when the average person started realizing this.

He kept gaslighting people about bidenomics saying the economy was doing “great” despite people struggling to purchase homes, pay their mortgages/rent, and buy groceries.

Never prosecuted the case against trump in a meaningful way. He made it way too personal and took the bait on all of trumps attacks. Never put abortion rights or project 2025 front and center in a meaningful way.

Can’t string together a sentence without mumbling or interrupting himself 2-3 times.

Now Harris has to clean up his mess and convince voters that shes the change candidate and walk the tight rope between being associated with biden and formulating her own path. It’s going to be hard work.",negative

"She's trying to appeal to people in the middle who, for any number of really dumb reasons, think Biden is too left-leaning. I understand the thinking and I'll still vote for her because the alternative is Trump, but at this stage in the capitalism life cycle it's pretty naive to think that we're going to 'small business' our way to economic prosperity for the vast majority of Americans. 

AI and automation are going to disrupt employment for millions of us, and those people who are affected aren't all going to be able to form start-ups and earn a living. At some point we'll be forced to come up with a form of UBI in order to avoid mass societal destabilization. Maybe not this election cycle or the next, but definitely sooner than most people think.",negative
You mean like when he appointed his son in law to oversee the pandemic after dismantling the previous pandemic prevention unit. Jared Kushner interfered with logistics blocking PPE to people in need.

Interesting. I’d like to hear more about how he interfered w logistics to block PPE. Did he cancel PPE orders to hospitals or like what was the mechanism.

I’m still not clear if you’re definitively saying there is no therapeutic use for any of the “treatments” that were mentioned in the article you linked.. as they relate specifically to Covid - could you please clarify?,negative

"you are just trying to whataboutism the topic, it is bad faith and the person is right to stop responding to you.


You asked for ""specifics of trump mismanaging the covid response"" then rather than assessing the very real evidence Trump dismantled the pandemic response team and undermined the CDC, you want to quibble if some random ass snake oil he promoted as a non-expert might possibly maybe potential could possible had a little benefit somewhere.


You are not a reasonable person, do not portend to present yourself as such.",negative
"Not at all. I’m just trying to get more specific information about your original post with regard to how the pandemic should have been handled differently by Trump. I think what I’m understanding is that Kushner interfered with federal provision of PPE to states (specifically masks) - which exacerbated the pandemic - and if the distribution had been made more freely by the Trump admin, our death rate would have been lower like in other countries.",positive
"What do you mean by dismantled the pandemic response team and undermine the CDC? I thought he was following CDC and Fauci recommendations.. I mean, his administration was only for the first year of Covid and I don't recall any negativity being thrown at the CDC during that time, but perhaps I am just not recalling. ""Random ass snake oil"" implies that what is being said is that none of the therapeutics mentioned in the article have any efficacy in terms of treatment options for Covid.. That's fine if it's the case - I am just trying to ferret that out. I agree that Trump is (CLEARLY) a non-expert, I think most presidents (much like CEOs) are non-experts.. they of course rely on experts. Look, I understand Trump said some random weird shit about bleach -  but in the broader context of the universe of ALL of his Covid comments in his capacity as president, I assume he wasn't just randomly Googling treatment information, I mean I think he was likely informed by someone close to him in his administration about possible treatment options - which included some of the options mentioned in the article. Setting aside the bleach comment, I don't think he was just operating in the vacuum of his own mind when it comes to the treatments mentioned in the article.

What have I said that is unreasonable? I asked some questions and sought clarification and then gave my own non-expert recollection of events and then, in this post, opined as to the source of Trump's information during that time..",positive

"This is what happens when the far right becomes normalized by the media instead of being called out as reactionary. It drags the Overton Window to the right and gives many dems the false impression that that's reflective of the population as a whole. 

We never see Republicans courting the ""center""—because they believe in right-wing policies. It's that simple. They know who they are and what they stand for, as ugly as it is.

What Democrats stand for shifts with the attitudes of people in the middle. In other words, Democrats chase a marginal group of swing voters and basically ignore anyone who's slightly left-wing under the assumption that they'll lose huge swaths of centrist votes, when a plain reading of the electorate shows that there aren't a bunch of people in the middle who go back and forth between the two parties. It's a few percentage points. 

Most people who vote are locked into one side or the other, with a bunch of folks on the left sitting out elections. Democrats scold those people who stay at home—rightly in my opinion—but it's a supreme act of political stupidity to not throw the occasional bone their way. They outnumber the fickle voters in the middle who flip back and forth between the two parties by millions.",negative

"It's not quite that simple. It isn't just that Israel buys weapons from the US, it's that we *give them the money to do so*. Some of that money is also used to purchase from Israel's own defense industry, and it's so important that it accounts for about 15% of Israeli annual defense spending (source: https://www.cfr.org/article/us-aid-israel-four-charts).

So, while Israel *could* find another supplier,  in order to match the aid they get from the US, whoever it goes to outside of that would also have to supply them the money to buy the weapons, as well as the weapons themselves. It would also have to be weapons that Israel would actually *want*, for example something equivalent to Iron Dome. Israel produces equipment for that on its own, but also relies on US co-production to meet demand. You also have to consider that, even if all those other things weren't issues, Israel in many cases would probably have to retrain its forces on new equipment that would be replacing the old US stuff.

My point is that, while not impossible, it would be an absolute pain in the ass for Israel to find new military suppliers to replace US funding/production, and it has the potential to seriously degrade both their economy and their defense capabilities in the near future.

"People miss the point entirely with Allan Litchman’s prediction. His keys are based on a fundamental truth - a majority of the population vote based on the success of the incumbent government. 

Election campaigns are based entirely on personality politics and the msm play us all for fools, when really we vote as a majority for stability and current government successes. US election history proves this point. Everything else is just theatrics.

Let’s look at 2016. Obama was effectively a lame duck president unable to pass any meaningful legislation due to Republican congress majority , couldn’t get his Supreme Court nominee approved. There was no major policy change, while the economy was humming along, people wanted change. As a result they voted R to bring about this change.

If you look at current administration, it gets a bad rap on inflation and immigration but it’s passed significant policy, it’s only the first term and economic headwinds are generally heading in the right direction. Even if majority of voters aren’t that thrilled with the progress, they appreciate that progress has been made and would rather give the first term government more time than throw caution to the wind and bring in another government.

That’s why it’s likely Harris will win. She’ll have a much tougher time in 2028 especially if her administration hasn’t achieved much particularly because the dems would have been in power for two terms.",positive

"This guy’s model is illusory junk. Here is why. He has made 10 predictions so far. He was right 9 times, missing in 2000. So he already doesn’t have a perfect model, just a pretty good one.. But let’s ignore that for a moment and look at the actual contests. In 5 of these contests, the eventual winner was obvious to anyone with any political awareness. For example, you  didn’t need a brilliant prediction model to know Reagin would win in 1984 or Obama would win in 2008. Any remotely rational model would get those right. So we are talking about 5 elections that were sort of close and he went 4/5. Random chance goes 2.5/5. So he is 1.5 elections better than random chance. And looking at the 5 relevant elections where the outcome was not obvious, here is another model that goes 4 out of 5. “The candidate whose last name is first in alphabetical order wins.” Now obviously this is a silly “prediction model” but it does as well as his does. And if he is right about Harris winning this year, it will continue to do so. The truth is that this guy is famous because he predicted Trump would win in 2016, an outcome that surprised many people. That’s it. But for some reason, people remain under the impression that the Trump win was some kind of 1 in a thousand outcome and predicting  it was amazing. Trump had about a 35% chance to win. This is like “predicting “ that the roll of a 6 sided die will come up either 5 or 6. It’s not the most likely outcome, but no one is shocked if it happens",positive

">Trump could still do what he did in 2016 and lie his way to victory

Well, he's been lying his entire political career. Clearly not going to change, despite supposedly being a changed man following the assassination attempt. And I generally don't think we should take comments from folks like Lichtman as anything more than wonks wonking each other off, but this is a fundamentally different election.  

Trump in 2016 benefited from folks not knowing what a trump presidency would look like, pointing to his past support for liberal politics as a sign he wouldn't be *that* bad.  He appealed to politically apathetic voters as a comical middle finger to an establishment that left them behind. He still does carry that appeal to an extent, but it's not as confident or funny as it used to be.  He's noticeably older, low-energy. His rants don't feel like pro-wrestling trash talk anymore. They just give off the vibes of being stuck on a phone call with a bitter old relative who won't stop talking.   

More importantly, tho, the Democrats are just running a better campaign this time.  Harris/Walz has momentum that Clinton/Caine only dreamed of in 2016.  They aren't ignoring swing states or assuming folks won't vote for an absurd reality tv star. They are focusing on calling Trump/Vance and their policies weird, not calling those who vote for them deplorable.  Plus, Walz is such a midwestern charm bomb, he's given the campaign a more loveable vibe than I ever thought was possible. None of this is to say the Democrats couldn't still mess it up - Netanyahu and his genocide in Gaza carries the biggest potential - and remember to VOTE and all, but there's a lot more to be optimistic about.  Ultimately Alan Lichtman's comments don't really matter.",positive

"The interviewer actually poses exactly that question to Lichtman.  Lichtma’s response:

"So is polling.  

From what questions, to how they are worded to what breakdown of respondents to weighting and correcting of data to the models assumptions to interpreting the models output.  

Shit, even what an answer means.  Do you support Harris?  Saying no doesn’t mean I support Trump but they will assume it does or doesn’t based on their subjective.  

Applied math is based on assumptions.  It’s really just logic written in numbers and symbols instead of words.  But a historian uses the same logic and arguments just not written in math and statistics.

Everything is able to be wrong - that's a core functional component of our reality, even if a lot of people want to pretend it's not.

Judges expertly apply subjective determinations that we refer to as judgements. Talent competitions have expert subjective evaluators that we call judges.

Subjectivity tends to move more towards objectivity when a person has a high level of competency or expertise in whatever they're evaluating, and I think the label of ""judgement"" is completely valid and reasonable. It's still not truly objective, and it certainly could be wrong, but it's more than just a guess.

We have situations where people come to different ""wrong"" judgements all the time. Look at the supreme court - even these ""experts"" don't agree on the material all the time and ""get it wrong"" depending on your point of view.",negative
That's not at all what that meant. You should watch some of his many videos. Him and his son Sam have been doing live videos. They will be on tonight at 6.

"So polling isn’t a useful model.  

His models output is binary so he doesn’t get to hide behind “margins of error”. 

But average polling is the equivalent binary and it’s wrong quite often.  It’s just communicated in a non-binary format that conveniently allows them to predict both sides “can win” with no method for anyone to test the validity of the model by repeating the experiment. 

They predict Harris or Trump could win based on a certain ratio.  They have never run an experiment more than once to verify if they’ve ever been anywhere near correct.   One of the two sides always wins and they always predict one will.    

You are equating apples and sausages because you understand neither.  ",positive
"But it's trying to predict an objective reality. Someone is going to win the election and it won't be decided by Lichtman. In all of your examples, the criteria is subjective as is the result because the people applying their subjective criteria also make the decision. Lichtman is making a claim of accuracy with a very clear flawed methodology",positive
"I mean yeah nothing matters except the votes here, for sure, but ""I don't like the methodology and can only explain why because it's subjective, MYEH!"" isn't really a great argument against it either.

Like honestly, what does it actually matter? It's a talking point. I'm not suggesting it's accurate or inaccurate, and people who are overly confident in their work get it wrong all the time. We criticize weather models for getting things wrong all the time, yet they're better than not having anything to base things off of.

It'll be interesting, though, to see how his model lines up with reality and continuing into the future. He has been right 9 of the last 10 (the one he got ""wrong"" being Bush v Gore which is.. controversial). He has credibility. Us random internet folk? Less so.",negative
"No he’s not.  You just don’t understand any of this.  

 Polling is applied statistics.  An applied math.  All applied math is subjective because it is applied by humans who are themselves subjective.   

 Human perception of reality is filtered by the subjective of the human observer.  Thus any attempt by them to understand that reality is based on that subjective.  Thus any mathematical model is built on that subjective.   

 Every aspect of polling is subjective.   What questions.  Worded how.  What the answers actually mean.  How to weight the pool of respondents.  How to weight the raw data.  How to create the model.  How to interpret the models output.   

 No poll has ever verified itself because no poll has ever been run on more than one election so there is no data to confirm the models margins of error 

 The poll says one side could win, or the other side could at a certain ratio. The election happens and one side wins.  They then declare the poll accurate. 


  In real science, you need multiple data sets from multiple test to test a model.  Not one set of data from one test.  ",positive

She should show anger when she talks about how his policies hurt Americans. She should show disdainful amusement when he brings out the personal attacks.

">*Historic funding to plug orphaned oil and gas wells will address environmental and safety hazards, create good-paying jobs in communities across the Commonwealth*

>The Department of the Interior today announced $76.4 million from President Biden’s Investing in America agenda for Pennsylvania to clean up orphaned oil and gas wells. The Commonwealth expects to be able to plug approximately 550 orphaned oil and gas wells over the next five years thanks to this historic funding. These investments to address hazardous sites will help create good-paying union jobs, catalyze economic growth and revitalization, and reduce environmental and public health impacts from harmful methane leaks.  

>Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Department is delivering the largest investment in tackling legacy pollution in American history, including $4.7 billion to plug orphaned wells. This includes grants to states in three categories: initial grants, formula grants, and performance grants. Since August 2022, the Department has awarded $565 million in initial grant funding to 25 states, including $25 million to Pennsylvania, to begin work plugging and cleaning up orphaned wells nationwide. 

>Today’s [September 3rd] announcement is part of an overall $660 million in Phase 1 formula grant funding being released on a rolling basis. As part of the award, Pennsylvania will detect and measure methane emissions from orphaned oil and gas wells, screen for groundwater and surface water impacts, and prioritize cleaning up wells near overburdened and disadvantaged communities.   
...  
Plugging is underway across the country. In fact, since the enactment of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law -- states have already plugged more than 8,200 orphaned wells, including over 200 in Pennsylvania. Nationwide, investments through the Department’s Orphaned Wells Program Office are estimated to have supported over 7,200 jobs and contributed more than $900 million to the economy over the last two fiscal years.  

>Orphaned oil and gas wells are polluting backyards, recreation areas, and community spaces across the country. Many of these wells pose serious health and safety threats to air and water quality by contaminating surface and groundwater, releasing toxic air pollutants, polluting drinking water sources, and leaking methane – a “super pollutant” that is a significant cause of climate change and many times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Plugging orphaned wells supports broader Biden-Harris administration efforts under the U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan.    

>The Department’s orphaned well program advances the Biden-Harris administration’s ambitious environmental justice goals through the Justice40 Initiative, which sets a goal to deliver 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments to disadvantaged communities that have been marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.  

>In addition to the $775 million available through initial grants and $1.5 billion in performance grants, states are eligible for $2 billion through multiple phases of formula grants. In August, the Department announced the availability of $775 million in Phase 2 formula grants, including $114.6 million for Pennsylvania. States have until December 13, 2024, to apply for Phase 2 formula grants.  

>In addition to providing historic funding to states, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocated $250 million to clean up well sites in national parks, national forests, national wildlife refuges, and other public lands, nearly $150 million of which has been disbursed over the past three years. This funding for states and federal land managers is in addition to over $52 million that has been awarded to Tribal communities.

Statement from Secretary Deb Haaland:

>“President Biden’s Investing in America agenda is empowering communities across the country to confront long-standing environmental injustices by making a historic investment to plug orphaned oil and gas wells,” said Secretary Deb Haaland. “These investments are good for our climate, for the health of our communities, and for American workers. With this additional funding, Pennsylvania will put more people to work to clean up these toxic sites, reduce methane emissions and safeguard our environment.”",positive

"Its several things.  Psychologically, Cons are very motivated by ""disgust"" and they grow disgusted when ""patterns"" are broken.  Trans people ""break"" the gender binary pattern by merely existing, this disgusts conservatives.   

Conservatives are also hard wired to believe they are the victims.  As society grows more accepting of the people they hate, they feel like they are being left behind.  Listen to conservatives on this, they will literally tell you ""I dont want to lose my job because I called someone the wrong pronound!"".  This is the ""all the sudden traditional religious values get you pegged as a bigot!"" argument that Alito makes all the time.   Lets just ignore the fact that in 1860 someone could have just as easily said ""all the sudden traditional values (about black peopoe) get you pegged as a bigot!""

Conservatives also need to feel strong, and they feel strong by comparing themselves to people they see as ""weak"".  They remember High School, they remember what they would have done to a 'boy' in a dress, and they know the teacher would have probably laughed. 

So in all, transgender people scare conservatives.  They scare them by being different.  Their acceptance scares conservatives because they can't stand being held accountable for their behavior and seeing their insecurities broadcast like that.  So to compensate, they get angry and violent.

"* It was Trump who wanted to honor the Taliban at a Camp David retreat in 2020

This left Biden only the option of continuing the withdrawal whether the conditions were right or not, or renege on the US deal and do another surge, putting troops back in.

"***The Telegraph reports:***

Kamala Harris has previously said she would support offering taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries to prisoners.

In a 2019 American Civil Liberties Union questionnaire, the then-California senator backed a raft of liberal policies including immigration detention and decriminalising federal drug possession.

The survey, which was sent to all Democratic and Republican candidates during the 2020 campaign, has resurfaced at an awkward time for Ms Harris who has been [attempting to shake off attacks](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/0/us-election-2024-poll-tracker-trump-desantis-biden/) from Donald Trump who has named her “comrade Kamala”.

The five-year-old questionnaire, which was discovered by CNN, will provide extra fodder for Trump, 78, to attack Ms Harris during [Tuesday’s presidential debate in Philadelphia](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/us-presidential-election-2024-when-dates-candidates-voting/).

One of the questions put to Ms Harris in 2019 was whether as president she would ensure transgender and nonbinary people who rely on state medical care “including those in prison and immigration detention” would have access to gender transition surgery.

Mr Harris answered “yes” before adding: “It is important that transgender individuals who rely on the state for care receive the treatment they need, which includes access to treatment associated with gender transition.”

Both sides might present answers to those that seem reasonable because many people just don't know enough to know whether the solutions might even work.

However, something like whether or not a drag queen should read to kids is a question with an answer that anyone can understand and you can easily form an opinion on.  The right then plays off of this by pushing more fear and hate and claiming that it is something more nefarious than merely reading. They can then paint the left as extreme.  They love to do this as a way to make people a 1 party voter.  Paint the opponent's entire party as the enemy and then it doesn't matter who is at the top of your ticket because the voter who believe the ""evil"" narrative will never vote for the ""evil party.""",negative

"That's why we leave the decision about what is medically necessary to the doctors treating the patients, and not a popular vote by the nation's citizenry. A prisoner doesn't just sign up for sex reassignment surgery like they do for a book from the prison library. They would start with meetings with the prison Dr, to determine if hormone therapy is even appropriate. Only after a lengthy period on hormone therapy would the topic of reassignment surgery even be raised. And only the doctor can determine if it is medically necessary based on their meetings with the patient. The small percentage of people that would 'benefit' from this per year is miniscule - and would likely be limited to the most extreme cases of gender dysphoria.",negative
">You couldn’t even convince a majority to support government paid surgery for non-inmates.

"You aren’t really wrong about any of this, though it ought to be pointed out that these factors reflect both an education gap and astroturfed animosity:

- To the extent people treat transitional medical care as frivolous or cosmetic, they are simply wrong. The body of research, not to mention all-but-any primary account from a trans person, easily disproves this line of thinking. And prisoners, as wards of the state, deservedly receive government healthcare. But lots of folks aren’t willing to hear it, because-

- Maximally cynical politicians, who see it in their advantage to push a zero-sum worldview, have singled out trans people as a convenient scapegoat. The endgame here, of course, is extremely dark and we don’t need to get into it; the important part is that reflexive prejudice is being actively and deliberately stoked through scaremongering by power-hungry authoritarians. And here we have a respected legacy media outlet happily taking up the baton for them. 

So, sure- maybe the broader public isn’t on the side of gender-affirming care for the incarcerated, and yeah, coming out explicitly in support of it almost certainly isn’t a good way to get elected in the near term. But we simply can’t ignore the extent to which opposition is based on misapprehension and fake grievance politics.",positive
"> You couldn’t even convince a majority to support government paid surgery for non-inmates.

Instead of rightly reporting on how things are, CNN has an angle to make the news into a sporting event where there are two equal opponents fighting it out.

Motivate people to vote. Motivate people to sign onto the plan. They don't have to agree with everything but at the end of the day they need a reason to want to vote. Give them a reason. Get them motivated. Keep the momentum up. 

I don't care if she's authentic. She's a politician last I looked. I care if she is willing to make progress and willing to help other Democrats. We have the option to have 12 years of a Democrat in the White House. To me that is more important than my feelings on her authenticity. 

>“Same old, tired playbook. Next question, please.”

"> if **they** take office again

They? You realize Biden won’t be in office if Harris-Walz wins, right?

> Joe Biden didn’t actually fix

Biden fixed PLENTY of the messes that Trump left for him.

Inflation was mainly a result of two things:  TRUMP’S enormous reckless spending, and global supply chain issues. [Data from the CRFB](https://www.crfb.org/papers/trump-and-biden-national-debt) shows that Biden has spent **less than half** of what Trump spent. This is reflected in the [US Treasury deficit data](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-deficit/), which shows that the deficit **skyrocketed under Trump**, while Biden has **decreased** the deficit by $1.4 trillion. Biden’s fiscal responsibility, Inflation Reduction Act, and executive actions to alleviate supply chain issues caused America to have one of the lowest inflation rates of any country in the world, and we are now one of the first to bring inflation under 3%.

The [data for number of unauthorized immigrants in the US](https://www.statista.com/statistics/646261/unauthorized-immigrant-population-in-the-us/) shows that illegal immigrant numbers are **LOWER** under Biden-Harris than they were under Trump.

When Trump lost, he intentionally threw the military into disarray to make sure Biden inherited as bad of a political landscape as possible, including [ordering an extremely rapid withdrawal from Afghanistan](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2022/10/13/trump-ordered-rapid-withdrawal-from-afghanistan-after-election-loss/). Despite this, only [16 US servicemembers have died under Biden, while 65 servicemembers died under Trump’s watch](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2024/09/03/world-war-iii-fewer-u-s-troops-died-in-combat-under-biden-harris-than-trump/), over 4x as much.

And do I even need to mention COVID?

All of the data and evidence shows Biden **absolutely** fixed a ton of things that Trump broke. And we are voting for Kamala not only to fix even more of our country, but also to prevent Dementia Donnie The Rapist from inflicting unprecedented damage to our country. The satisfaction of seeing him get what’s coming to him will just be the cherry on top.",negative

While at DHS, George co-drafted regulations and Federal Register notices including ones making aliens ineligible for asylum where there are reasonable grounds for regarding them as dangers to the security of the United States (based on emergency public health concerns caused by communicable diseases); implementing Safe Third Country Agreements between the United States and foreign countries under which certain aliens are barred from applying for asylum in the U.S. but rather removed to those foreign countries to seek asylum; and expanding the geographic and temporal scope of expedited removal authority for inadmissible aliens. He also co-conceived the legal structure of the Migrant Protection Protocols (under which aliens apprehended crossing the border from Mexico may be required to wait in Mexico pending the initiation and completion of their removal proceedings in U.S. immigration court) and helped develop the legal rationale for the use of Title 42 authority to expel aliens apprehended at the border during the COVID-19 pandemic. While at DHS, Mr. Fishman was also detailed to the White House's Office of American Innovation to draft the legal immigration reform provisions of Jared Kushner’s proposed immigration reform legislation. Prior to the beginning of the Administration, George had served on the Immigration Policy team in the Trump Transition Office.

> Ms. Cheney on Friday tried to frame the joint family decision to vote for the Democratic presidential nominee as something beyond party, one that had to do with country and &quot;Duty.&quot; She explicitly rejected the idea of not voting at all, as some conservative Republicans have signaled they plan to do.

> The show of support from both Cheneys is significant for the Harris campaign, which has been pouring tens of millions of dollars into a paid media campaign targeting anti-Trump Republicans.

> In her panel discussion with The Atlantic&#039;s Mark Leibovich, Ms. Cheney said she would not be acting as an official surrogate of the Harris campaign and said she had not spoken with Ms. Harris since her announcement of support earlier this week.

Trump somehow forced himself into a victory in 2016 and then even further radicalized the voter base. The Republican party (outisde of the MTGs or Boeberts) would drop him in a second if they thought the voters would go back to regular establishment Republicans.

I predicted the party would split and the Republican party would not survive. My hope being a new conservative party would rise from the ashes. 

At times I've felt that prediction was a bit extreme, and no way would it happen. Then I'd see how the party was fracturing and think it was pretty on the money. 

Right now I think the party will slowly collapse. But depending on the outcome of this, and maybe the next 2 elections, it could either be a fast collapse, happening in 5 years, or a long collapse, taking 20 or more years. If Republicans lose this election really badly, and the midterm election also goes poorly, then we could see that fast collapse. If this election is close (or God forbid Trump actually wins), and the next election they pick up seats, I think it'll take longer. The party might be able to reform, but as long as the MAGA Trumpers and the far right Evangelicals control the party reform looks slim. If the moderates finally grow a backbone and start kicking MAGA out, then the Evangelicals might fall back in line behind strong leadership.

"The biggest thing to keep in mind is that political party funding is based on presidential voting, so it's nearly impossible for a third party to compete, much less Replace one of the two major parties. 

It's far more likely for a political civil war between factions of a party, leading to an internal revolution when 1 side wins. That's effectively what we've watched as Trump and MAGA has taken over the GOP.

I think the most likely next steps would be something like:

Trump cases away/dies and the GOP has a battle between the new MAGA crowd vs the traditional Neocons battling for the soul of the party. I don't think anyone currently exists that has Trump's charisma (to his followers), so I actually think that part of the party would fade quickly, unless a new outsider emerged that could harness that power in some way. (I really don't think either of his sons would have any ability on their own, they only get attention from their proximity to Trump. Others, like DeSantis faded quickly)

It's also possible that Trump losses all his luster on his own. It's already started to fade and if he loses again (also losing the Senate in the process), the MAGA movement may implode on its own, before Trump has even left politics (or he may give up on politics after this election, considering how low energy he already is)",positive
"The most likely scenario is (D) Republicans keep running the MAGA playbook long after Trump is dead, and it works pretty well for them, because it gets them to a coin flip in the electoral college for the presidency and keeps them in control of the House and Senate most of the time. With the Supreme Court secured until the second half of the 21st century, there is no reason for Republicans to ever act sane.

Harris isn’t looking good in PA. I don’t think a lot of Democrats have really accepted that a second Trump term is still a strong possibility.

This isn't \*just\* a play to keep Trump from being elected again, although that is a big part of it.  It's also a play for the party.  At this point, they've got nothing to lose.  There's no place for Kinzinger or Cheney in this iteration of the party, no matter what they do.  They're just not crazy enough.

"The big problem with Florida for Democrats is they've fallen so far behind in registration. In 2012 when Obama won the state, Democrats had a registration advantage of around 700k. And they were still somewhat close elections. The GOP was still winning the governor races even with those numbers. Today, Republicans have an advantage of over 1 million in Florida. That right there is the big problem. 

The second problem is the state Democratic party is a joke. They haven't ran a half-way decent state-wide campaign in years. The messaging is terrible. And its a revolving door in the party leadership.

The best hope the Democrats have in Florida this cycle is to stop the bleeding. They need to halt the GOP gains with registration and show in the results that they've at least pulled the plane out of the death spiral. DeSantis is term-limited. So the governor seat is wide open in 2026. The GOP will have a brutal primary because there is no obvious DeSantis successor. So Democrats have an opportunity to recover and make a play if they can field some strong options and make the right moves. But it should be recognized the uphill climb needed here.",positive

Biden and Harris changed the entire make up of the election overnight and I have real doubts as to whether pollsters have managed to accurately capture that shift in their methodology.  Especially given Dems have been over performing since Dobbs, and it appears enthusiasm for Trump is genuinely waning.

I think there’s a significant, albeit low, possibility that we see a shocking drop in Trump’s support while Harris over performs wildly.

It vastly improves mental health, social functionality, and quality of life, while drastically reducing rates of suicide attempts from about 40% down to around the national average.

And it's worth remembering that comparable or even identical medical care, including reconstructive surgery and hormone supplements, are routinely provided (and covered by insurance, including medicaid/medicare) for cis patients without controversy or question of their medical necessity.

Someone's gotta figure out how to get these dipshits together for a damn intervention. Not the leadership, mind you.

It's their **voters** that can't seem to piece it together that them going from *Romney to* ***Trump*** *is a HUGE difference for* ***their*** *party, let alone for politics altogether.*

That the entirety of their platform is now functionally defunct and only runs on memes, jokes, pseudo-knowledge, constant lies and no ground with which to put their feet on. They are just floating in a space whose only purpose is seemingly to just piss off everyone else. Not even for their own gains, which is the insane part. Their voters literally said ""He isn't hurting the **right** people"", which means their intent really is to cause damage to other Americans that aren't them and that they're perfectly fine voting ***for*** that **even if it means they directly get hurt, too. Hence why they said ""he isn't hurting the right people"" and then (oh so ""intelligently"") decided to vote for him again** ***after*** **they said this.**.

[Rep. Lizzy Fletcher] “Colin and I were both in the Capital on January 6th. I was up in the House gallery, Colin was down on the House floor.

And as the warnings came in that a mob was inside the Capital, as we heard beating on the doors and breaking glass, I watched as Colin took off his suit jacket, ready to fight anyone who came through that door.

We saw that day, and in the days since, the very real threats to our democracy that I know are on the minds of everyone here. And I am here to tell you that there is no one, no one, more committed to protecting our democracy, our freedoms, our rights, our progress, and our country than Colin Allred.”

The Warning with Steve Schmidt - [Ted Cruz hid in the closet during January 6th riots](https://youtube.com/shorts/x-XszoQLOCY)

[Rep Colin Allred] “I just want to talk about January 6th because I was there and I was about 50 feet away from Senator Cruz when he objected. At some point the representative from Sergeant at Arms gets on the microphone and tells us that the Capital has been breached, tear gas has been deployed in the Rotunda. 

You know, being the only former NFL linebacker on the floor, I take off my suit coat and I’m literally preparing to have to defend. And some of my colleagues joined me and took off their suit jackets. Particularly the younger men.

While that was happening, Ted Cruz, who had whipped up that mob. And who had gone around the country talking about how this was a “steal.” And who was, as we learned later, part of the legal backing for trying to challenge this. And who was implementing the legal strategy, which was to try and delay, delay, delay. He was hiding in the supply closet.

One has to remember Obama took all the heat for the financial meltdown. Even in more liberal circles around that time, it was Obama who had to carry that burden.  Even with it already going into year two by then. 

“9/11” for the most part people are going to remember his calm demeanor more than him taking the advice of those around to bomb the shit out of everything in the Middle East and Afghanistan (Obviously exaggerating some.) Those that won’t are deeply political in the first place or military that had to attempt to clean up that shit show.  

As a “wartime” president though his administration actually holds up pretty well on domestic issues (like not blowing the debt ceiling more than it was already projected to be and education, last major investment period on a national level) and after the brutality that was invading Afghanistan, not a single major nation challenged America’s resolve internationally. The latter is no small feat. 

Really was the last hurrah for classic liberalism. (Note classic being in front. Huge difference than if I put American there instead.)

"Nothing to do with what they want. They're making an educated economic forecast for something that will affect you directly. 

Even without Goldman Sachs in the picture, it's a verifiable fact that Republican administrations usually fair much worse for the economy, including Trump's:

*support a crazy dictator siphoning their money. I fully believe they would have been fine with a smarter one that doesn't have all the legal/idiot baggage Trump does.,positive
"I mean, realistically I don’t think this is designed to kill democrat excitement, because I don’t think there are really that many democrats that are going to basically say “oh Dick Cheney is voting for her? Well I hate him so I guess I can’t vote for her.” But I do think if you have conservatives that are maybe on the fence and historically more traditional republicans who are fans of Dick Cheney, you might actually get people listening to the fact that he is literally calling Trump the greatest individual threat to our country.",negative
I don’t think there will be lasting overlap. The Cheneys coming onboard for Harris is explicitly *not* the forming of a lasting alliance. I think of it more as an “enemy of my enemy is my friend” situation. It’s not about electing the democrat. It’s about *rejecting* MAGA and reclaiming conservatism.,negative
"That's what he his to sane people, to Republicans he is what the party used to represent. A lot of Republicans now consider him part of the swamp/elite/RINO because that's what they're told to think about R's that don't support Trump, but there might be a few persons left that won't show up to vote because of this.",positive
Is Elon really involved in Tesla much anymore? I have a feeling the board members at Tesla and SpaceX encouraged him to buy Twitter so they could continue operating normally while he drove another business into the ground lol,positive
"Eh, by the 4th season I was over it, just wanted all of them to die in a plane crash.",negative
"Copy and pasting a different comment of mine;


Nah Lachlan used to party and not care about work (Roman) while James was always working hard (Kendall) but Rupert never liked James like he did Lachlan, same as in show. Then James and Kendall both had major fall outs with their dads",negative
"They have published their fascist plans in a big book called Project 2025. Those plans will strip the rights away from all the humans you claim to be “pro” and then some. They will come after the LGBTQIA+ community and they will persecute them and remove their rights. They will do the same for those who are pro-choice, pro-environment, a woman, a POC, an immigrant, and the list goes on.

You can “disagree” on matters of opinion but it becomes more difficult when the facts are printed in plain view. If you want peace, let me give you a reality check—fascism will never be the better option for America. Republicans stalling progress with their minority rule of this country is the status quo—don’t keep falling for it.",negative

"They all paved the way for Trump. Now they’re refusing to acknowledge that, and they’re pretending he isn’t just the natural continuation of the Republican project.",positive
I’m ok with that. We need a strong two party system unless one of those parties MAGA.,positive

"Exactly. I'm *really* not looking forward to the next chapter of whitewashing these scumbags' careers with the public's willingness to forget about them being the ones who got us here. Of course everyone is going to fall for their ""let bygones be bygones"" act and will just let them continue their shenanigans again until they get their next corrupt leader in.




There's already too many Republicans setting the stage for this, claiming Trump ""stole the soul of the Republican party and what it represents"", despite him being the complete embodiment of it.",positive

"I also think that Trump is the culmination of republican politics and embodies all the worst aspect of republicans.  However, I will not disparage or diss anyone who is willing to publicly condemn Trump and endorse Kamala.

"Don't get me wrong: the way Democrats are willing to accept the right into the fold (and, subsequently, push their party even further to the right) is distressing.

Harris and the DNC should absolutely give Cheney, and most Republicans, the finger.

But, that's not how politics works.

As they were praising Harris for taking on the big banks, they had the former CEO of Amex speak on her behalf.

Don't, for a second, think this was any kind of endorsement of Cheney. 

It wasn't. 

I don't believe in Hell. But, if there is one, I hope he spends the next squiptillion eons in immeasurable agony.

Maybe Harris, who said she's [""honored""](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/harris-says-dick-liz-cheney-put-country-above-party-with-endorsements-2024-09-07/) to be endorsed by a war criminal. I really didn't think this would be something that needed explaining, but not only should a candidate not acknowledge endorsements from mass murdering war criminals, they should also not paint said endorsements in a positive light.

Also, no. I'd say Cheney and Trump are about equal in awfulness, with Cheney perhaps having the edge on account of, y'know, all the Middle Easterners he killed.",negative
"And yet in your original post you pay Cheney a compliment. I'm reminded of the Dril ""you do not, under any circumstances, 'gotta hand it to them'"" tweet.

Cheney does not have a better moral compass than anyone. He is as vile a person as Trump, arguably more so when looking at a worldwide perspective rather than a U.S.-centric one. Hypothetically, if in 2028 Harris runs against Vance and Trump lives long enough to endorse Harris over Vance, will you be speaking positively about Trump having a moral compass?",positive

Again, horrible person. But that juxtaposition is a story - a narrative, and a powerful one, of how much of a threat to this country, the rule of law, and to democracy Trump poses. We shouldn't look the other way - we need to call it out and weave it into the narrative.",negative

"Yes. While their likely turnout model could be correct, it's still questionable how they altered it to keep Trump +1 here. I've pointed out elsewhere but if they overlaid the same turnout model that they had in their last poll, it would be +1 Harris here. For reference, they increased the white/non college turnout and decreased the white/college turnout by several points.

Basically every other reputable national poll has Harris up. NYT won't get many clicks by releasing a +1 Harris poll. But a headline that says Trump leads Harris? That's going to be an attention grabber. Look how many times that poll was posted and reposted here.",positive

"This is definitely the big reason people are pissed at the NYT. It’s not because of an outlier poll (NC polls suggest Harris is ahead by 3- within the margin of error but still a good sign), it’s more that people see the blatant hypocrisy of NYT and other “liberal” news media regarding Trump’s age and cognitive ability while railing on Biden for weeks. It’s cowardice and potential greed based on who runs these networks (either republican or simply just Jeff Bezos)",positive

"What exactly is unlikable about kamala? Genuinely asking. Is it her voice- is it too nasally, is it her laugh. I find Donald trump so annoying and cringey...that slow, low pitched drawl that I just can't see how he fares any better. 

He is an entertainer to be sure and kamala was more subdued during the CNN interview than trump would have been. But is it that you like Trump's theatrics and braggadocio more. Like you want an actor and an entertainer as your president...is that really more presidential. By the way not even arguing, genuinely want to understand what people find unlikable about her cuz I personally find trump so incredibly boring to watch and his constant self boasts sound so incredibly pathetic. His constant mentions of how smart he is me so smart, me went to wharton, do people not find that unbelievably unlikable like that really bad C student in class who boasts about being oh so smart until people discover his transcript. That's the energy trump gives off to me. But genuinely curious what the other half thinks. 

I just don't see what people see in him. Kamala has such a natural comfortable in her skin energy, I honestly think people just can't believe a woman can lead a country and it could be any woman, she would face the same uphill battle. It's not really her voice or her laugh or whatever, its deep seated bias. You can't imagine and visualize kamala making decisions for you, holding a meeting, deciding on foreign policy etc. cuz there is no template or past example for you of a woman president. When she has a long and successfull legal career as proof enough of her abilities but it does not suffice. But hey would like to know what you think anyway?",positive

The NY Times editorial board put out an essay eviscerating Trump this weekend.  The fact it’s apparently a commonly held belief on this subreddit that the NYT is some kind of right wing publication really goes to show how skewed your perception becomes when you expose yourself to nothing but partisan propaganda all day.  ,positive

"...and NYT/Sienna is the top rated pollster on 538:

The numbers are the best pollsters can come up with.

... in this article, pointing out that it's just a single data point, not a trend, and not the end all be all.

Then the author loses me. 12 paragraphs on Trump, most of them carefully worded to paint him the best light possible. This isn't an NYT thing, this is a media thing. This quip :

> Mr. Trump, of course, has plenty of political weaknesses. A majority of voters still view him unfavorably — as they always have — and say he’s a “risky choice” for president. Abortion, democracy and Project 2025 all stand out as major liabilities in the poll.

You can already see them doing this, like the raid on LULAC volunteers or reducing the Harris County mail in drop boxes to 1.",negative
"It keeps getting closer every election. It's why the Republicans fight dirtier every cycle. Texas polling as a toss-up, even as an outlier poll, is big news that should strike fear into the GOP and bolster the Democrats. It's why they don't want new voters.",negative
"1. Siena has done poorly all season. They gave Dean Phillips double digit support and downplayed Haley significantly. They've been consistently incorrect.
2. NYT does this thing where they get their monthly poll and write about it for weeks. This poll was already discussed and this article is 100% a click bait rehash.",positive
"Siena College is not a bad poll. The article failed to mention that the September poll over-sampled Republicans slightly (R48, D45), and results was about the same in the more balanced July poll (R47, D46). So, it is in fact a 2% shift towards Harris.",negative

They are recording what is happening at this time in history.",negative

Fair enough.  I guess my stance is it’s not terribly unusual the NYT published an article about this huge poll they co-sponsored.  Of course they’re gonna talk about it.  If the results of the poll showed Harris at +5 this article would be at the top of r/politics right now.  ,positive
"Yes I am going to stick to my story because I’ve cited a lengthy essay that the NYT published where they say with no uncertainty that Trump is unfit for the presidency.

"So... I hope everyone sees what CNN is doing here. 

They're completely misrepresenting her signing an ACLU questionnaire five years ago.  Through a series of inferences, they draw the conclusion that this COULD be used to provide transgender surgery for migrants, despite this not being mentioned anywhere on there. 

That's how hard they had to look to make the headline you're reading there.  And this isn't an opinion column. This is CNN as CNN.    This has been a trend ever since Chris Licht took over. Even though he's gone now, their tone has continued shifting further to the right.",positive

">Harris has acknowledged that some of her stances have evolved over time but that she holds core beliefs that remain unshakable: “My values have not changed,” she said in an interview with CNN last month.

Most politicians' stances change over time. Biden said that 'Will & Grace' changed his views on same sex marriage. What you don't see her do is digging her heels in or doubling down. She's not drawing a sharpie to show how ICE is the one that moved. Whether you agree with her or not on *every* subject isn't as important as whether you think she'll (or any candidate) will work hard to try improve *every* American's life.",positive

Any time she spends explaining how her “values haven’t changed” regarding her prior belief, for example, that illegal border crossings should be decriminalized is a boon to Trump’s campaign. 

The only path forward is to change the subject as much as possible, just as Trump needs to do on issues like abortion.",negative

And stretching back 5 years, a lifetime in politics, to dig some *shallow* position of Harris is ludicrous when the time would be much accurately spent on the true and deeply disturbing issues at hand, and that is Trump, Project 2025, and everything else stupid about his positions. The two are *not* the same and don't deserve the same efforts, one is a felon. Again CNN is shallow and empty and is exactly the problem with the media in general.",negative

"Yes, this. Republicans refusing to endorse Trump is one thing. But if old-guard GOP voters were to see Pence, Romney, Ryan, Cheney, and Bush all stating that they're voting Harris - well. That's another kettle of fish. That's an alternative, for them - they're no longer leaving the party and their identity behind if they leave Trump. Instead, they're the ones staying true to what the party was before he hijacked it. 


Now, as a onetime GOP loyalist in my childhood and early 20s who realized that they were always lying for my entire life about what they are, I think being loyal to the old character of the party would still be pretty terrible. But I think there are certainly friends of mine from our College Republicans group, for example, who have been disgusted by Trump but couldn't bring themselves to vote blue - who might be encouraged if the onetime leaders of their party were to set the example. 


For that reason, I hope Cheney is only the first of this group, and that the rest are to follow. We have only this one chance to keep our democracy. ",positive

"Not to diminish the terrible bloodshed Cheney is responsible for (and yes, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis did die as a result of his lies), but tens of thousands of Americans did not die in the Iraq War.

4,507 members of U.S. forces died in that war. Even after adding in the 2,420 members of U.S. forces that died in the War in Afghanistan, that still adds up to 6,927 deaths. That is far short of tens of thousands of Americans. Tens of thousands of U.S. forces *were* injured though.",negative

And I think it's also understating the case to only cite soldiers who died in combat. A lot of soldiers came home and died of injuries, tens of thousands suffered TBIs, long term illnesses from things like burn pit exposures, and of course suicide. We'll never know the true number.",negative
"Well, when you consider the choice Cheney has to make.  It's doesn't taken much of a leap to understand his choice.  He's looking for a conservative as you probably look for a more liberal choice.  I guess I should have stated my opinion clearer, but media pukes making a big deal out of his choice is stupid!  Yes, iif Kamala, the Senate & the House are blue there will be changes Cheney doesn't like, but if Donnie von Shitzinpants wins, and the MAGAts disrupt the house for another two years he'll lose more and he probably has figured that out.  Anyway I laugh at the news media and their sensational ways.",positive

Politically, yes he is a liberal nightmare.  That doesn’t mean he hates his daughters.",positive
"I'm not disputing any of that, and I do wish there were a more reliable way to assess the true toll of the war.

Nevertheless, the evidence we currently have does not firmly corroborate the claim that tens of thousands of Americans died in the war (or from injuries and trauma from the war that were a contributing factor) - though I acknowledge the number could well be thousands higher than the current official toll would have us believe.

I also think it's a damn shame that this country doesn't do nearly enough to help veterans who have been injured or become ill as a result of their service.",negative

"> Why?

While there’s been disagreements brewing within the GOP (migrant labor, Ukraine), .. think Taiwan was the catalyst (based on previous reading of public reactions).  If that country goes, the U.S. will have to go back towards JFK, LBJ, Nixon, and Ike levels of MIC-driven top marginal taxes due to the difficulties in reshoring semiconductor production.

"This article is pointless without specifics.   It's just pondering about politics without any specific policy recommendations.

Even the universe of people who are personally loyal to Biden, and might take offense at slights to his accomplishments, consists entirely of partisan Democrats who will vote for the Democrat at the end of the day (or more likely, several days before the end of the day).

"I can see why people would react negatively to the headline, but the author’s core rationale makes some sense. 

“And Biden is, on the whole, a liability for Harris. He has been deeply and consistently unpopular since relatively early in his administration. The most recent Times poll finds that 61 percent of voters want the next president to constitute ‘a major change’ from Biden, but only a quarter of them believe Harris would constitute such a change.”

Chait isn’t wrong on this point — it’s hard to be the change candidate while also being the incumbent vice president.

I don’t think the answer necessarily needs to be to jettison her policy ties to Biden, but clearly there’s work to be done to strengthen how people view her. Maybe the debate will help.",positive

"It doesn't make sense to strongly associate oneself with a president people blame for rising inflation who also polls terribly against their opponent. People forget that just 44,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin separated Biden and Trump from a tie in the Electoral College. Biden *barely* won in 2020.

It doesn't matter that Biden did a good job, that the inflation isn't his fault, and that in fact, the inflation is likely much better than had Trump been in office, because presidents get blamed for what happens under their watch.

Winning elections isn't about who's right or wrong, who's moral or not, it's a contest of enthusiasm, of gamesmanship.
 
I see it all over my Facebook with midwestern voters I'm friends with, they uniquely hate Biden, and that association bleeds onto Harris. They don't hold nearly the same dislike for Obama for instance. That's why Harris is polling so much better than Biden. The last thing she needs is to be even more associated with him. 

At the upcoming debate, Trump is going to likely spend the entire time tying inflation and Biden's policies onto Harris, painting her as equally responsible for the rising cost of food, power, rent, basic necessities and the initial few years of record immigrant surges (despite the fact that it was Republicans who shot down the bipartisan border bill).

The Republican attack plan is to go after Biden and strengthen the association between him and Harris, so why in the world do so many Democrats think it's a good idea to *help* Republicans strengthen that association? They're literally doing Republican attacks for them.",positive

"Biden's only been bad regarding the Cold War era ""special relationships,"" the three relationships we hold entirely for domestic political reasons rather than any worth of those countries itself. He still thinks the voters that make them relavent to Democrats are still relevant in the present day, when in reality two of the three have been in decline for decades and are bordering irrelevance.

Those three would be Ireland for Irish American voters, Israel for Christian ""Holy Land"" pearl clutchers, and Cuba for Cuban Americans.

Ireland is the only one not in decline, with the Irish American vote still as strong *and relevant as swing voters* as ever. Looking at Ireland diplomatically and there's hardly a reason to put that much effort into a country in a region where we have bigger strategic partners. Economically speaking it's in the EU, and it is silly diplomatically to put that much effort into Ireland when you need every member to approve of an EU trade deal. Biden, Obama, and future presidents would be correct in continuing to cater to Irish Americans at the expense of (most likely) the British.

Israel, or the religious voters that make it relevant, have both been in decline for decades *and* veering right out of swing status. Strategically speaking it sits in the ever irrelevant Levant, unable to influence areas that truly matter like the Persian Gulf. Case in point their complete lack of presence in either Iraq wars. Nor, for a country constantly bragging about fighting terrorists, any presence in Afghanistan, the definitive ""war on terror."" Economically speaking they're too small, don't sit on a geographic chokepoint, don't export any critical resources in influential numbers, and finally don't dominate an industry to such an extent where they're irreplaceable (see Taiwan's TSMC for a example.) The difference plays out when comparing Biden's current policy with Obama's publically critical policy of 2014, the one that kept that conflict down to weeks vs Biden's months.

And finally Cuba, embargoed despite global disapproval entirely because we cater to a small population clustered around a critical swing state.......or at this rate, what *was* a swing state. Strategically speaking Cuba's just irrelevant to us. Their only relevance is as a (terrible) base for some enemy of ours to stage from, and nobody is remotely close to fielding a navy that could make that an actual threat. Biden could have restored normalization after Obama's legacy got trashed by Trump, but never did.

That said, in any disciplined party it is a large faux pas to be publically opposing the current leader's policies. Biden kept to Obama's policy in 2014 despite what we know he would have done as seen in 2023. Obama similarly has publically supported Biden's policy despite never publically regretting his 2014 criticism.",negative

Many people don't vote based on fact, they vote based on feeling. Biden's record is great, but his *image* cannot be rehabilitated. If people felt Biden's record was amazing compared to Trump, he wouldn't have polled so terribly.

Trump goes up there and has just as bad word salads, if not worse, than Biden, but he still has tremendous support. The problem is Biden's image, not his record, and Harris does not benefit from leaning into that image which polls so terribly.",negative

And I imagine that Cheney sees Trump for just what he is: A degenerate narcissistic conman who is weakening America, capitalism, and Cheney's vaulted philosophical conservatism for no reason other than his lifelong insatiable personal appetite for self-aggrandizement. Dick must know that a second Trump term, cloaked by the Supreme Court's recent endorsement of presumed immunity for the President, is one of the greatest risks we have ever faced.

"Dick Cheney is smart enough to know that a vote for Harris is 2 vote swing AWAY from Trump. A vote for a 3rd party is a complete wash, and a one-vote swing TOWARD Trump, from a progressive/Green voter. It doesn't advance the candidate's policy in any meaningful way, it doesn't send an actionable message, nothing. This is a two horse race. It's mathematically guaranteed by the system we're unfortunately using. And there is ONE viable party whose candidates have ever done anything to further the possibility of shifting to systems that would allow 3rd parties to even stand a chance.

The reality is that 3rd party voters just don't understand the dynamics of elections. The Democratic party doesn't cater to progressives because they have proven time and time again that they are an unreliable voting bloc full of people who are determined to find ANY reason not to vote for them. In races from local to national, they have learned from experience that progressives as a whole don't want to meet in the middle, they want their demands met. And they're willing to sabotage the candidates that most align with them, even if that alignment is low, which directly helps the candidates that have *even less* overlap with their views, if those demands aren't met.

Gaza will not see ANY relief under Donald Trump, which is de facto who your vote is benefiting. Harris at least has drawn a distinction between Israel defending itself and what is actually happening, which is, as I'm sure you're aware, a risky stance to take even if her private beliefs are fully on the side of freeing Palestine. A condemnation of Israel means absolutely nothing if she loses the race because it turns off the substantial pro-Israel crowd.

In 2016, though she had a horrendously run campaign in general, including the primary, Hillary made quite a few concessions to the platform in deference to Bernie's more progressive coalition, which was rewarded by... nothing. Progressives were pretty apathetic and didn't turn out for the candidate who MUCH more closely represented them. In 2000, the Democratic candidate who aligned more closely to the Green Party's platform than any other in the past 50 years lost because of 600 fewer votes in a state where Ralph Nader got almost 100,000. The most vocal supporter of political action on climate change in modern history was undone in no small part by the Green Party.

3rd parties are spoilers to the parties they are ideologically closest to, full stop. You're not taking a principled stand for anything, you're proving yet again (as a group of voters) that you're not worth being catered to. You can't be relied on to vote in a way that gives your agenda a shot because you let the perfect be the enemy of the good.",positive

"We have no direct evidence but it was pretty shady. Cheney was CEO of Halliburton before he was VP.

I doubt it has to take Dick Cheney, and not some hats within ABCs, to take proactive action if it ever comes to that. 

Call me a nihilistic cynic but – past or present – every dictatorship, banana republic, and tinpot dictator planned & implemented some level of contingency plan *in case* some red lines were crossed. Even ""democratic"" countries in Europe had/have Operation GLADIO-type of plans in case the ruzzians would've invaded. 
The UK too has an obscure *what-if* novel, and serialized on TV, called ""A very British coup"", where a Labour candidate becomes the PM and the British establishment become active, tries to bribe him, he refuses, and then at the end it is implied that the British military/secret services enacted a silent coup.

Of all mentioned countries, again, call me a nihilistic cynic, I doubt the US wouldn't have such a perennial contingency plan, without having to have old powerful politicians make or deliver statements to signal something.",positive

Random people are free to endorse whoever they want, and that doesn't mean the person they're endorsing has to stand by every political opinion they hold. If that's how it worked, then literally every candidate would be unelectable because *somewhere* some shithead supports them.

People talk about endorsements because they matter to *some people*, which means they matter in the polls. An endorsement from Dick Cheney is newsworthy because it means whoever out there has respect for Dick Cheney might be more likely to vote Harris.

I personally have no respect for Dick Cheney, which means this endorsement doesn't affect me in the slightest in either direction. Frankly, I'm not going to have my political opinion be influenced by Cheney of all people and I'd suggest you do the same.",negative
"This is exhibit A for my point. I think it's insanely privileged to vote in a way that makes it clear that Trump's policies won't affect you negatively enough to move the needle. You're perfectly willing to let him win because the closer candidate/party hasn't ""earned"" your vote.

But getting pandered to is a reward for voting faithfully, not the other way around. I hate that that's the case, but I'm not stupid enough to pretend it isn't. Trump voters show up in droves, they've been destroying anti-Trump Republicans in primaries for the past 3 elections, and look at that, the party bends to them. Having a completely non-negotiable platform and then not voting in a way that makes any of it even marginally more likely does not send the message that you're a valuable voter to try to attract. 

The Democratic party has moved to the right because they get more votes than when they move to the left. Because the left, which I still generally consider myself a part of, as a whole is full of people for whom being self-righteous is more important than actually making a small amount of progress toward their goals. The millions of people whose lives will be made materially worse if Trump wins, including those in Gaza and Ukraine, are less important than making a doomed grandstanding statement with your vote. The women who will die because they can't get abortions or the kids getting religion shoved down their throats are just not enough of an issue compared to [insert pet cause here]. They will ignore problems they actually have the chance to affect, and instead fixate on things they can't realistically change. This isn't true across the board, but it's common enough to be a real trend.

The idea of building enough grassroots support for a 3rd party presidential candidate is a fairy tale. As their support grows, they will create a bigger and bigger advantage for their political opposites, thereby creating even more incentive for the party they're siphoning support from to drift further in that direction. This is just as true for libertarians as it is for the Green party. At this point, I still think most voters (and maybe even most candidates) are well-intentioned but naive, but I get less sure about that every time the topic comes up.",positive

"> And what has Harris actually done?

As VP? Cast the most tie breaking votes in US history. Negotiated with Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador in an effort to lower migrant immigration from those countries, and was successful enough at it that the number of migrants coming from those countries dropped in half. 

As a senator sponsored over 160 bills, including ones to fight climate change, legalize weed, protect worker paychecks, expand research into medical issues faced by women, whistleblower protections, infrastructure repair, expanded voter rights, etc, etc. Cosponsored over 1100 more bills. 

Meanwhile Stein has....ran for president. That's it. Oh, and turned the green party into a laughing stock. 

>If you are not a Putin fan, why are you simping for the candidate he just endorsed?

Putin ""endorsed"" her because he knew doing so would sow discord among those ""special"" people dumb enough to think he meant it. 

Harris is for strengthening NATO. Not something Putin or Stein wants.

>Stein is no employee of Russia... 

Stein didn't want us out of NATO until after she visited Putin in Moscow back in 2015. 

In 2016 the Internet Research Agency helped campaign for her. A firm that is ran by a Putin ally in Russia. 

Don't forget about her little speech in Red Square that same year. Not to mention all the Russian propaganda she pushes in regards to Russia and Ukraine.",positive

I am no zealot.

You're clearly not arguing in good faith, not even trying to deny that the only realistic alternative to Harris is Trump. If one doesn't win, the other does, and he will indeed be worse for Palestinians on top of everyone else. I'm more pro-Palestine than I am pro-Israel, and that's why I'm voting for the candidate who has at least expressed some desire for a ceasefire that *doesn't* end with Palestine getting glassed.

That shows you just how far off the deep-end the GOP has gone because of Trump. 

The old conservatives are aging and dying, and the party is being replaced by fascists, and even the old school Republicans see it. If Bush and Cheney were 8 out of 10 on the political extremism scale, Trump's falling in at roughly somewhere between 50 and 100.

Trump is not a good guy and he doesn’t have your best interests at heart. He’s a senile psychopathic rapist who just yesterday said he didn’t rape a woman because she’s not the type he would have chosen to rape (implying that he did rape women, just not her). 

If you’re concerned about innocent lives being lost, you may want to know that he negotiated the US withdrawal from Afghanistan by inviting the Taliban to camp David, instead of the democratically elected government of Afghanistan. He coordinated our withdrawal with the terrorists, instead of our allies, leading to the direct deaths of tens of thousands of men, women, children, and babies. 

He separated asylum-seeking immigrant children from their families in a way that was purposely not traceable, leading to thousands of children never seeing their parents again. 

The democrats have nearly always only used the military to intervene to save civilian lives (the genocides in Kosovo, Rwanda, and Somalia are the most recent examples). They are not war mongers. They use our projected force to maintain peace, not for profit. 

As for your baby killing comments, I don’t know if we’ll see eye to eye in this, but I can tell you that Trump’s actions have directly led to hundreds of thousands of women who have high risk pregnancies (diabetes, being over 35 years of age, etc.) not being able to receive any medical treatment because doctors are afraid to touch them. Do you think that’s good for those babies? The babies that actually need the most help are being refused medical care because politicians, led by Trump, have decided that if the care even indirectly leads to the fetus’s death, the doctor(s) can be charged with murder. This is directly leading to more babies dying and the blood is on Trump’s hands. 

Meanwhile, there is only one party pushing for the government assisting with child care, giving kids free school lunches (there are millions of children in this country who go to bed hungry every night), and helping working families who are struggling with medical and school debt, and that party isn’t Trump’s. 

I suggest broadening where you get your political news from, because it sounds like you’re not getting the full picture.",positive

Since Labor Day there’s been a flood of articles proclaiming Harris is down in the polls and I get the sense that:

2.)  Trump is going to lose the election and these polls are working to build the narrative that the election was rigged/stolen, “Waa I didn’t lose!  The polls had me winning!  Waa!”  Trump baby will cry.

The other thing is that the Media wants a horse race because to them it doesn’t matter who wins because they’ll be winners anyway.

"Let's be honest here. The deck was rigged against her from the beginning. For four years the media on both sides has said she was a problem. She had very low approval rating and was never expected to have to compete in an election. 

Many on the left wanted an open convention to pick the most qualified candidate (eg. Cenk). But for whatever political reason, we got Kamala instead of Josh Shapiro or Gavin Newsom. 

Kamala is simply reverting to her previous polling averages, which are not very high. The elation gained from ditching Biden kept her up in the polls for a little bit, but it may not be sustainable. 

DNC astroturfing support and trying to gaslight people into thinking she was a great candidate was probably a mistake in retrospect when we could have had an open convention.

They're going through past events we already know about, like the Afghanistan withdraw, and trying to retroactively turn them into scandals. That tells me they have nothing on Harris or Walz.

My personal gut feeling is the debate will mostly be a wash. Trump will mostly control himself (thanks to a muted mic), he'll do much worse but the media will spin it as a draw because he didn't take a dump onstage.

Based on that, I don't think it's fair to say that D+2.8% falls into the ""definitely losing"" category. It would be more fair to say that at D+2.8, the electoral college is very close to 50/50.

">*Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act support a state-of-the-art high-performance computer system to advance weather, climate, ocean and ecosystem research*

>Today [September 3rd], the Department of Commerce and NOAA announced that $100 million in funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act has been awarded to General Dynamics Information Technology for NOAA’s newest high-performance computer (HPC) system, called Rhea. 

>Rhea will advance research on weather, climate, ocean and ecosystem prediction. Rhea will be installed in a new modular facility as part of the NOAA Environmental Security Computing Center (NESCC) in Fairmont, West Virginia. NESCC currently is the home of the Hera HPC.  
...  
Rhea features graphics processing units that will accelerate NOAA’s use of AI/ML in a range of areas, including monitoring marine life species, weather forecasting and modeling of specific environmental phenomena such as atmospheric rivers, fire weather, and hurricane intensification using Earth observations. The new computing capacity will also be used for weather and climate model development to improve drought, flood, and wildfire prediction and forecasting.

>The $100 million in federal funding will support the installation of a modular data center unit which will house Rhea, storage, networking and switches, and be connected to the current HPC center at NESCC. This project represents a novel approach to expanding HPC and provides room for several additional modular data centers to be added in the future to further expand HPC speed and power for NOAA and other federal and private partners.

>Once online, Rhea will be part of NOAA’s Research and Development High Performance Computing System, which includes four other research and development (R&D) HPC centers. The other sites are located in Boulder, Colorado; Princeton, New Jersey; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and on the campus of Mississippi State University in Starkville, Mississippi. 

>The addition of Rhea will add about eight petaflops of computing speed and capacity to NOAA’s existing R&D HPC capacity of 35 petaflops, bringing the total to 43 petaflops. A petaflop is one thousand trillion, or one quadrillion, operations per second, and represents an extremely fast computing speed for a single machine. In addition, NOAA is integrating another HPC system at the NESCC that will bring the grand total of R&D HPC to approximately 48 petaflops.  
...  
NOAA’s Research and Development High-Performance Computing System has already helped NOAA improve weather forecasting and climate projections by increasing the warning times for hurricanes, tornadoes and tsunamis. HPC has helped researchers better understand ocean dynamics, our changing climate and its impacts and supported private enterprise with research to inform economic decision making.  
...

Statement from Assistant Secretary of Commerce Michael C. Morgan:

>“The Rhea high-performance computer system adds needed computing capacity for NOAA to expand critical research that supports the nation’s climate resilience,” said Assistant Secretary of Commerce Michael C. Morgan, Ph.D. “The new system will strengthen NOAA’s exploration and application of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) capabilities, which will ultimately improve weather, ocean and climate forecasting, ecosystem modeling and the use of satellite Earth observations to understand climate changes.”

Statement from Zachary Goldstein, NOAA Chief Information Officer and Director of High Performance Computing:

>“This investment in high-performance computing will result in significant scientific and economic impacts,” said Zachary Goldstein, NOAA Chief Information Officer and Director of High Performance Computing. “The computer’s installation at the NOAA Environmental Security Computing Center in West Virginia will strengthen NOAA’s partnership with the West Virginia High Technology Foundation, which is committed to building a stronger, more diverse economy for the region.”

Neither Bush nor Pence would have the gravity that a Dick Cheney endorsement has. Neither Bush nor Pence were as synonymous with the ultra right wing of the GOP as Dick Cheney.,negative

The fact that Dick fucking Cheney of all people is saying that he supports Harris is definitely saying something. Next thing that we know, Bush breaks his silence and endorses Harris.",positive
The gop continuing to shift infinitely right at the sacrifice of their voters who now openly embrace the other side in opposition sounds like a political realignment imo.,positive

Cheney a neocon not far right,neutral
"Pence already said it out loud that he couldn't support Donald Trump. That isn't him endorsing Harris but just not supporting Trump. If somehow Bush, Pence, and Dan Quayle would publicly support Harris then all surviving presidents and vice presidents other than Trump would be supporting Harris. (Though Quayle seems unlikely as he did support 2016 Trump though also pushed Pence to certify election in 2020 so who knows there probably will just stay quiet as who remembers Quayle other than for potatoe.) Bush who is younger than Trump has tried to stay quiet in politics so also unlikely. (Quayle who was vp under hw bush is also younger than Trump). Trump is old.",positive

How so? Cheney’s only record is voting for war. It could be said that only thinking his motive is to stop Trump is insanely stupid. I would say it’s more naive than stupid though. But you do you and trust Dick Cheneys word when a year ago you would’ve called him a war criminal (and still should).,negative
"The thing is however the core majority Republican base is not shifting away but going along with being further right as was shown in 2020 and 2022. A few Republicans coming out to endorse Harris is not going to change this until something completely drastic happens. Plus, the Republicans are gaining ground with young white males particularly too so there will be fresh blood to continue this rightward shift for some time",positive
"Yes, something along the lines of a consistent historic blowouts in the vein of FDR and consistent Democrat domination of Congress is what it'd take for Republicans to maybe readjust themselves or they'd wither away and something else would replace them.",positive
War makes for strange bedfellows. And make no mistake: Trump and his ilk are at war with the best of the US.,negative

"I think he will. If Dick Cheney comes out in support of Harris, expect Bush to come out too.

I think that if he views this as being too high risk not to endorse her, he will come out of silence. 

I think he does take this race seriously, and he probably won’t tow the line anymore.",negative
"I just wanna see Carter hit 100, I don’t know that he will or should. I think we can all assume who he’d endorse.",positive
"""Yoko Ono herself into frame"" LOL",positive
Probably and I think Bush would have a greater effect than Cheney. As while Cheney was the true power during the Bush administration the conservatives and Republicans really rallied around the Bush family (grew up in a Republican Indiana family parents are still very much devoted Republicans though are very willfully ignorant Bush coming out in support of Harris may wake some of the ignorance off of them as they aren't particularly conservative individuals just keep their heads in the sand and live in the republican media bubble). Bush was someone who the family looked up to compared to Trump who my parents and fanily don't like per se but vote for out of party loyalty and the demonization of the democratic party.,positive

Made me LOL as well,positive
"I really do think that in the wake of this endorsement, he’ll come out.",positive
"We can hope. Pence and Quayle are unlikely. Pence is teaching political science at a conservative university (as he really doesn't have much money or patronage unlike a lot of politicians and probably doesnt want additional attention/conservative assassination attempts) and Quayle who is a CEO with an investment firm and board on a water sector company so probably will stay quiet as he hasn't been too involved in politics and generally responsible business leaders try to avoid political attention as it often leads to other attention, but Quayle did attend Joe bidens inauguration and did push Pence to certify the 2021 election. (2021 one of 3 times in American history that election certification is threatened and the most absurd of the 3 as 1861 was a seccessionist crisis, and 1876 saw voter fraud and suppression following the rise of confederate regimes clashing with republican groups in much of the south and so actual issues with which electors to certify so thus 1877 compromise, 2021 was a fair and free election where media manipulation and foreign involvement trumpeted nonexistent voter fraud and led to an absurd attack to disrupt what was essentially a procedural vote) 1800 and 1824 also caused electoral controversy with 1824 leading the house to elect quincy Adam's and 1800 but the issues there were not certification threats but the result of lack of a clear winner.).",negative

Screw the mics. I see no audience as a big plus for Kamala! Trump's ego is going to short circuit with no drunken acolytes to cheer him on.,negative
I hate Trump and want him to go away forever.,negative
"As long as Harris controls the conversation, she should be good. Trump will just lie the entire time and if she keeps responding to what he says then he's in the driver's seat. Not a good thing. 

Ignore what he says. Harris just needs to lay out specifics and make sharp attacks on him, he'll lose his cool and the debate.",negative
"Personally, I'm for the mic muted for this lunatic as he would've kept interrupting. 

It will allow Kamala to keep her focus, as good as she is in public speaking and as former prosecutor, without the 3 year old rambling and lying with his own defense. We've seen how much he's interrupted in the past.

And I feel the less chaos during the debate is not a bad thing as that's what Trump wants. He'll still lose the debate. I would be shocked if talked anything that made sense, even once during the debate. I know we'll be laughing at his rambling most of the night.

It'll be about himself and only himself.",negative

Trump will agree and his handlers will be powerless to stop it.",negative

"I don't know. In the debate with Biden with muted mics and no audience, Trump seemed to keep his cool and looked vaguely more presidential because of the rules.

If you want to see him go wildly off the handle, I tend to think a live audience would help that.

Not sure how that dynamic changes with Harris instead of Biden -- certainly Biden didn't help because all Trump had to do was shut up and let Biden ramble, but I certainly think at least in Biden's case that the rules ended up helping Trump.",positive

Breaks moderation rules if she directly asks him questions. She’ll just instead merely point out how he didn’t answer any question compared to herself,neutral
Because she will still kick his sad ass and she knows it (if he bothers to show up). That's my guess.,negative
"Biden’s camp insisted mics. Trump didn’t want them Joe said he was scared to debate. Trump ultimately ended up agreeing. Joe stepped aside. Trump didn’t agree to original debate because it wasn’t Biden. Kamala said she would only debate him if it was the original debate time and place that he had to agreed to with Biden and called trump scared to debate. Trump ultimately ended up agreeing. Now she’s trying to change the rules of the debate she wanted and somehow the mic thing got turned on Trump like it was his idea the whole time. She made her bed, now she gets to sleep in it.",positive
trying to strike a cord but its probably a DINO,negative
In what world are you living in? Trump will either spout insane easily disprovable lies or actually try to answer a question and sound like an escaped mental patient.,negative
"Yeah I guess your right.

From what I've heard from her acceptance till now, she can throw down! And she's likely gained a tremendous amount of wisdom from conversations with Walz! 

I'm thinking of ripping the seatbelts out of my car and hooking them up to the couch for this one!",positive
"That’s because Biden didn’t press shit on Trump. Hell, the only time he attempted and dunk was when he stupidly took Trump’s golfing bait, and failed.

Kamala, OTOH, has professional level piss n vinegar in her veins! That, combined with her being a woman and her skin color will completely change Trumps efforts",negative
"Idk I think I he Biden debate isn't the best thing to go off of. Trump wasn't phased because he saw Biden looking like a nursing home patient.

The delivery of the line about I don't know what he said and he probably doesn't either was all the proof I needed.

It wasn't a ego protecting insult it was a true insult coming from genuine confidence that his opponent was cooked in terms of being able to explain himself clearly",neutral
Pretty sure they said the same thing about Biden...,positive
"> She made her bed, now she gets to sleep in it.

She probably literally doesn't care if the mics are muted or not, she's just fucking with him to keep him flustered and on the defense",negative
The mic thing is not that serious.,positive
"Oh well, I still see Kamala having no issues at all.",neutral
Exactly! He will be no match for her prosecutorial skills.,negative
"Yep, early on Trump realized he wouldn’t have to do much to actually win. He just ended up talking about whatever he wanted and didn’t directly answer any questions. Once he hit the “I don’t know what he said, and I don’t think he did either” line, it was pretty much done.",positive
Harris is not Biden.,neutral
That is also a possibility,neutral
I agree,positive
Anything is possible! She might just mop the floor with him!,neutral
Fingers crossed 🤞🏽,neutral
I so hope Kamala uses this line on him during the debate,positive
