The vast online resources that exist to teach you how to find free food in your area.

There are so many foraging websites, content creators, social media groups, it will open your eyes to a new reality of free food everywhere.

When you walk in the woods, you are surrounded by free food, it‚Äôs like walking through a big organic grocery store where you are allowed to shoplift all you want. You are walking on a salad bar, and almost everything around you is edible or useful in some way.

It is an exciting lifelong adventure, learning more things that you can eat or use every year, even after decades of foraging. I can make dinner for free, and have fed whole dinner parties for like $10 in store-bought ingredients.

Can you identify dandelions and violets and clover? Congratulations, those are edible, you can just start with those. | Language learning resources through your local library!

I used to be negligent to my own health on my early years. I ate unhealthy things. Instant noodles, fried foods, fast foods, etc. I barely eat vegetables. 

Then, when my father passed away, I tried to pay more attention to my own health. Trying to google what is healthy and what is not. And guess what. The stigma that 'healthy is expensive' is not true at all. 

Yeah, if you wanted to be an athlete, then you might need to spend more. But if you just want to live a healthy life, without pursuing the path of becoming a professional, all you need is to know what is healthy to eat and what is not. 

And also regularly do exercise. 

Believe me, a bit of Googling before eating can help you keep yourself healthy. And you all know how expensive it could be if you just have to be taken care into the hospital. 

Just a few minutes of free browsing can spare you from unnecessary disease and bills.

- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org): multiple different subjects (mostly STEM) at various grade levels from kids to adults & is 100% free  
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=free): multiple different subjects (mostly STEM) at various levels (aimed mostly at adults) including degrees. Some courses are paid but plenty of free ones too  
-  [Academic Earth](https://academicearth.org/online-college-courses/): multiple subjects (mostly STEM but somewhat broader than the above 2) taught by universities. A lot of free college courses but can pay for degrees too.  
- [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu): multiple subjects (mostly STEM but even broader than the above) all taught by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) at mostly undegraduate & graduate level (though there are a few at high school level). Like Khan Academy it's 100% free  
- [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/catalog/all/free/any-school/any-skill/any-difficulty/any-duration/any-type/most-popular/page-1): mostly computing/programming/CS based with some business orientated courses. Tons of free courses and lots of paid ones too.  
- [edx](https://www.edx.org/courses?q=free+online+courses): an even broader range of subjects compared to most of the others taught by universities and some even by parners like IBM & Smithsonian  
- [The Open University](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/free-courses/full-catalogue): a whole ton of courses in various subject areas at different levels of which all 100% free under their OpenLearn section. Of course they do also provide actual degrees too which are typically notibaly cheaper than going to a normal university.
  
Notable mentions:  
  
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com): who doesn't know what YouTube is by now? An incredibly vast wealth of educational content on a ridiculous amount of subjects. Levels & quality of courses & education can of course vary, and it might not always be easy to find something worthwile spending time on (not to mention the rabbit holes you can end up down in!), and the ads can get frustration if you're unable to block them (or pay for a subscription). But for all its downsides it's arguably one of the best sources out there.  
- [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org): just like YouTube who doesn't know this incredible source? As always never take Wikipedia at face-value and always check sources, and if something is out-of-date or interests you more then Google/Bing/search engine of choice is your friend.
- [Philanthrophy University](https://courses.philanthropyu.org/courses): a few limited courses on topics mostly aimed at helping non-profit organisations, but 100% free.  
- [Cubebrush](https://cubebrush.co): a digital art storefront which mostly sells digital assets, but also hosts tutorials made by individuals with some as low as $1, and there are weekly freebies which occasionally contains free tutorials (e.g. a character drawing one as of writing this).  
- [Elements of AI](https://www.elementsofai.com): two 100% free courses provided by MinnaLearn alongside the University of Helsinki to teach about AI, both what it is and how to build it.  
- [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning) (previously lynda.com): provides an incredible amount of courses in subjects including business, creative & technology. Does require a subscription however you can get a month's trial for free. Some workplaces even provide free unlimited access so worth making the most of it if you can. You can also earn certification to include on your LinkedIn profile which can help bolster your profile.  
- [Upskillist](https://www.upskillist.com/courses) (previously Shaw Academy): a large number of courses in a variety of subjects, however there's only a 7-day free trial. However I have occasionally seen promotions to get a whole month for free in various places.

There's every episode of certain series, and most films that I've searched for have been on there. | Libby and Overdrive sound great, but [eBooks are a really bad deal for your local public library](https://www.govtech.com/biz/data/behind-e-books-libraries-find-restrictions-and-high-costs) and you should try for a paper copy if possible.

In brief, the same book that might sell for $25 for a library edition is often $55 for an eBook - a price the publisher can set because they're only selling a time limited license and the know they're probably losing a few sales on it. Sometimes the licenses are time limited, but instead limited by the number of checkouts, and then the book stops working and the library has to purchase again.

The situation has gotten to the point where many libraries spend more than twice as much on electronic content as they do on paper content. Once I saw how bad it was, I started to change my habits a bit. And, because I live in a small town, the librarians know me and my family now and it's become a nice ""third place"". | Seriously impressive, thanks for sharing! | Retro gamers paradise | Great mention! Internet Archive is where I watch the Goosebumps and Haunting Hour series in the fall since it has the entirety of both and the unreleased Haunting Hour episodes! | Internet archive is amazing.

Strange quirk with NY library cards though, if you get that online because you're in NY but not NYC - it renews for 3 years, but the initial expiration is only 1 year.

Another commenter said how they happened upon a brilliant performance of Dracula. I tried to listen to the Leviathan but had to give up a few pages in since the narrator kept switching after every 5-6 paragraphs, not chapters.

this is not an ad, I didn't buy it myself, just that I consider it a very good deal (to have the latest version + storage at this price even if it is recurring) | I honestly prefer Google office products at this point. Never thought I'd say that before. 

But for my use cases, Google sheets for example is INCREDIBLY useful. Collaboration without license bullshit, the inclusion of app scripts, bigquery integration, etc. makes it amazing.

For example there was a commercial for fruit rollups in the mid-80s that featured chimpanzees on a school bus.  Four year old me remembers that.  I loved to see those monkeys.  But once the commercial stopped airing, it was seemingly lost in time forever, just a random thought in my memory.  Fast forward a few decades, you can basically just search for it on youtube and you'll find that memorable commercial and scratch the itch that your brain has been hanging onto for years.

Wikipedia isn't the wisdom of the masses, it's the wisdom of a few dozen un-credentialed people with the time to spend on it.

On a personal note, he got me through my engineering maths units, I would have been completely boned without those lessons. | Free educational help. Good for hw if you dont get a concept. | Too many influencers peddle the dumb paid stuff for anyone to know about it. | The worst part about that is that in regular classes you fall behind and get to a point where you can't understand a thing. With Khan Academy and other online resources it's easier to go at your own pace and rewatch videos if you need to, or just stop and look up whatever they talk about if you don't understand.

I would say it probably helps, if only because it's in video format and you can start at any level you need.

They spent a long time tip-toeing along the razors edge of what they could get away with, but they took a long-jump over the line with the book piracy.

I'm a big reader and thought my Amazon kindle subscription was a decent deal, but so much of the free offerings were garbage. I dropped it and haven't missed it | Hoopla is excellent for ""I need it right now"", as there is no waiting period like there is with Libby. The tradeoff though is that you only get a handful of borrows each month, so use them wisely.

Another wild thing about Hoopla is that it effortlessly displays graphic novels on really old tablet hardware. My sister gave me an old iPad 3 with a ruptured battery thinking it was toast, but I was able to replace the battery and get it working. I tried to use it as an e-reader and found that it would not load anything in a reasonable manner. Did not matter the file type (PDF, ePub, etc) or the reader software used - that iPad was dead slow, loading a single page at a time, even in proprietary iBooks.

In a last ditch effort to get some usability out of it, I installed Hoopla and was shocked that after download, it displayed a very visually-rich graphic novel (the Incal) as fast as I could turn the pages. 

I don't really read graphic novels very often but if I want to read one I just fire up Hoopla on the old iPad 3 and it's a dream. | Main difference is if you‚Äôre a kindle user.

This is what I used years back. You can search for the free courses and through there I took the CS50 of Harvardx and an introductory course programming in Python from MITx  
  
They are free but you can pay some money, identify yourself with the platform. Then, you will receive a personal certificate with your actual name.  
  
So now, I can say that I, Firstname Lastname am Harvard and MIT educated :)  
It may just be through the edx Platform but the courses are still coming from these institutions.  
  
The CS50x one is in fact is the actual CS50 class real Harvard students take. You get to see filmed lectures were you see the students sitting in the lecture hall interacting with the professor etc. | Some courses only take 15 minutes, so by the end of today you can add two extra pages to your resume üòé | https://pll.harvard.edu/catalog/free | iCloud is pretty good for that.

Also look up + email addresses for Gmail | https://temp-mail.org/en/ | There‚Äôs all sorts of different email types too.

For example, with gmail you can use youremail+mysupermarketbonuscard@ and that‚Äôll work, allowing you to essentially filter and tag certain inbound emails. 


Then there‚Äôs sites like Temp Mail which provide you a quick one time email. Great for trying something without commitment. 


There‚Äôs also email forwarding services by DuckDuckGo / https://duckduckgo.com/email if you want a future email but don‚Äôt want to share your actual email. Privacy is the main attraction here.

I remember first reading 'some people say' and the statement was flagged as ""*who?*"". Made me think that its a dirty way of saying 'well actually its just me saying it but that wouldn't sound as good'.

On the flip side, some articles aren't as moderated and that stuff slips through. | It heavily depends on the article. If we‚Äôre talking about something pretty obscure and straightforward, like some random explanation of a chemical reaction for example, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty likely to be accurate, albeit a bit basic and maybe not sufficient, but not strictly incorrect. If I‚Äôm looking into information on a current political candidate the wiki won‚Äôt even be opened because that just asking for issues. 

But honestly even on pretty large and popular topics that aren‚Äôt heavily opinionated it‚Äôs fairly reliable. Like WW2, I‚Äôve used several wiki articles on papers for school and verified the facts with sources and found no issues on it. People only alter articles relating to pop culture typically and that‚Äôs usually not paramount to a lot of educational research | This is the same thing teachers have been saying since I was in high school like 15 years ago. Yes, sometimes things slip through the cracks, but the likelihood of a person looking up any given topic and reaching a page where some clown decided to input their own false information are infinitesimal.

More often than not, if a page has fallen victim to untrue information it‚Äôs glaringly obvious.

The average person can browse Wikipedia without concern, and if they are indeed researching for a particular purpose and do happen upon a page with falsities, as long as they are properly sourcing it will become very apparent very quickly. | Have you got an example? | Spending the money on Rosetta stone is 100% worth it.

A credit freeze has nothing to do with personal/self-made credit reports requests or your accounts on the experian, equifax, and transunion sites. A credit check happens when an outside group (like a bank you apply for a loan with) is checking your credit to see your history. A credit freeze only applies to those checks as it prevents outside companies from pulling a report. You're not freezing your account, you're freezing the ability for other companies to pull your report.

Credit reports coming from all 3 credit bureaus from the link provided via the FTC website above are just soft reports sent to the individual directly and don't even show up on a credit history. It's essentially like checking your bank balance via online banking. You don't have to unfreeze your credit history to request your credit report. I have a credit freeze and still pull my own monthly since it's my own credit history. I don't have to lift the freeze, I just log in to the equifax website and do it.

All people should have credit freezes in place, but they should also be pulling their own credit reports since it has absolutely no effect on your credit history and exists for the consumer to stay informed about their credit. | Even META AI is very good in WhatsApp. But depends on how you choose to use it.

So, technically not free.

[Fees](https://www.uopeople.edu/tuition-free/processing-fees/)


Yes, it's still minimal, but for many people who have little to no income, that's a lot of money. 


The scholarships? Well, you have to pay to apply before you can even begin to apply for scholarships, so again, not free. Could you get it reimbursed? Perhaps, but again, a lot of people don't have the application fee to begin. They even note they may deny because lack of funds, which I could see being a thing since there are a lot of poor people out there.

The Times is also very goodml | Associated Press and Reuters are fairly neutral. | Also CBS, ABC, Wall Street Journal | I disagree.

I kind of miss those. | Stop procrastinating and go get that that diagnosis! | I'll take 'responses that don't make any sense' for a thousand Pat | As a 30-something going back to school after not writing in APA in over a decade, thank you for this.

It won‚Äôt take long to learn and once you figure out how well the built-in Fairlight (sound design suite), Fusion (compositing and motion graphics) and the colour grading suite work together in Resolve, you won‚Äôt look back.

Adobe sell this stuff to you separately promising a seamless experience, but dynamic link fucking sucks for the most part. Davinci does it all in one.

If you want to abandon Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign, you have to the Affinity suite which offer a 6 month trial. One payment and you own them.

I use the alternatives I mentioned above at home. | Why nervous? You lose nothing unsubscribing from adobe. You lose nothing resubscribing. You lose nothing trying free software while you still have paid software.

Bunch of twats. | That's how *everyone* ended up playing bass. 

Maybe with the exception of John Deacon of Queen, who probably tried to find the most boring instrument that would still somehow maybe get him laid on day. | It's been forever since I picked one up but same lol I just wanted to play something when my other friends were jamming.

Plus I could play *random funky bass line noises* and annoy everyone. It's a win-win. | As someone who never had time to learn an instrument, I have always gravitated towards the bass. It is the first thing my ear picks up in a song and because of that it is the reason I like the genres of music I do as they focus on a driving bass line that is a focal point of the music, primarily punk and its hardcore and post hardcore sub-genres. The standard guitar to me feels selfish in music, often feeling like it is trying to pull the spotlight from vocalists, horns also feel the same to me. | This only works in jazz, funk, or punk. | They are not protecting the legal copyright of the book. Do you even know what the entire thing was about?

The internet archive was just acting as an online library. They loaned books, but only as many as they had physical copies of.

So if they loaned out 1984, and they had 5 physical copies, that would mean 5 people could lend 1984. Person number 6 would have to wait until one of the 5 copies would be available again.

Like a library, which is legal. | Fuck copyright. 

And your analogy about people using a swimming pool is bullshit and doesn't apply. | Internet Archive owns the copies of the books they lend out. It‚Äôs literally a *library*, the sole difference being that they lend a digital, rather than physical copy.

So if the Internet Archive shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to lend out books they paid for, then neither should your local library. | Literally 1984 | It would be Orwelian if the company that sold the water told you when and how you could use your swiming pool. Thats the issue. By restricting access to the book, they are censoring it. 

The book was written and digitized. Copying books that are digitized in this way is illegal, it should not be. A teacher borrowing the book and making it digitally available to their students would be illegal, it should not be. By supporting these rulings, you are not helping the people who own the book, only the people who own the rights to the book. They should not be protected.

Sorry by the way ‚ô° I have a hardline stance on this ‚ô° | Yeah, there‚Äôs definitely pros and cons for both. I much prefer using my kindle over my iPad for reading. 

But the availability and knowing if it‚Äôs on hoopla you can borrow it with no wait is pretty great. I‚Äôve found that I use Libby for kindle reading and hoopla is fantastic for audiobooks. Also worth noting that I feel like hoopla has added a ton over the past few years. I found it pretty lacking at first, but the past year or so I‚Äôve been able to find most things I‚Äôve wanted, no matter how obscure. | May your femurs shatter! | Good luck! | You dont need luck mate, just dedication and interest. You started the course so youve got the interest already. I wish you good progress instead. | I started with a book called ""Python Crash Course"" by Eric Matthes, just a free pdf i got online, probably illegally (I should buy it some day just to pay the guy back). I had no previous knowledge on the subject at all. I went through the whole thing and did all the assignments, a few hours a day. 

Then I started doing one of those online courses (jetbrains) for a short while, the kind that give you a short lesson and some interactive assignment, it wasn't great but it did fill in some gaps. 

Then I discovered cs50 and that's when the serious learning process felt like it started, I had to learn to properly use git and github and upload assignemnts, I had to do an actual web app at the end using everything I learned. 

Then I did cs50web and got deeper in the web stuff and I did another different web app as a final assignment using more complex stuff than in the previous course.

At this stage I've gathered enough stuff on my github that I could put on the cv as proof that I'm actively doing stuff, I had nothing else relevant to put on a resumee.

I built a linked in profile and started applying to every remote job offer I saw, I got rejected and ignored a lot. I got into a few interviews and got rejected a lot again, to the point where I stopped being nervous and just learned to relax even if I bombed.

During this time I also started going through The Odin project to learn more frontend stuff but I got through half of it until I landed an internship. Some stuff I learned in the Odin project definitely helped in that interview.

I treated every failed interview as a learning experience, I politely asked the person at the end of the interview what they thought I should look up and learn more and everyone seemed more than happy to help with a bit of personal advice for 5-10 minutes extra time in the call. I can't say employers were fighting over me but in the end once company decided to give me a shot.

All that said, I do consider myself extremely lucky to get hired 2 years ago when remote jobs were more common and when companies were still hiring like crazy compared to these days. I think it would probably be a bit more difficult these days but you never know what the job market will be like in 1-2-3 years so you might as well start getting ready. There are companies out there willing to give you a shot if you're willing to learn, you just gotta be ready when they start looking. | This is something I'd like to hear about as well | I'm in a similar boat. Learning from nigh-scratch. I had some html, css, flash, and JavaScript exp from 15 years ago. freeCodeCamp is a good resource and honestly there's hundreds of thousands of programming tutorials in every language imaginable on YouTube. For JavaScript, I found [Eloquent JavaScript ](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) if you prefer a book. Mimo is a decent but ad-filled gamified learning app to get you started with nice repetitive exercises to help with retention. 

Learn Git, download VS Code, learn the basics in a language, and just start mucking about. 

I'm learning PLC programming for work but in my free time also learning java script on node because it will help with coding HMI down the road. If you live in an industry-heavy area, PLC could be a good way to go. Be curious, have fun, bite off a little more than you can chew and remember that struggling with a problem is the best way to deeply ingrain that knowledge so don't get discouraged or go look up the answer without giving it a run or two first. 

Generally also- getting good at learning and note-taking can be worthwhile pursuits to start building your own compendium of knowledge in a pkm system. I like to write little summaries in my own words when I learn a concept as a memory tool. | Imo, it'll be hard to emulate what he did right now. After years of saying coding jobs were the perfect job and some massive layoffs, we get a pretty saturated market. Those with no bachelor degree will have a harder time. | At 24 you still have enough time to learn anything and become anything, the issue is that most (myself included) don't realize that until after 30 and regret wasting so many years. 

Looking back at my 20s the best decision and my greatest achievement was to get a dog, besides that it's just a long series of bad decisions, or no decisions or bad life consuming activities and bad jobs. | Using ChatGPT to aid me in online courses to answer questions and explain complex issues has been life changing for me. For the first time I feel comfortable taking online classes | It's in the parent comment | Sure, so if your email is `joebloggs@gmail`, you would do lets say `joebloggs+reddit@gmail` or `joebloggs+shopifystore@gmail` and the email would come through to your gmail as normal, but if you press the little down arrow next to the text that says `to me \/` in gmail under the senders email, you'll see in the `to:` field that it says `joebloggs+shopifystore@gmail`, so it's then really obvious to see if the website sold your email, or if you want to block that sender you can just create a rule that deletes any emails sent to that plus email. | Why would anyone want to use Notepad++ on Linux when vastly superior editors/IDEs exist for Linux? | Why are they called decks now? | I commend you on your dedication. | That's great but you don't sound like most people... | You can get unlimited storage for $9 a month from BackBlaze. | if you are that diehard of an office user sure, buy it. most of us only use the basic functionality tho | Can you pirate the newer versions of office?

Man, I Love Frogs | But what about [Phrogs?](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8JXABGA/) | ... and Canada. | And Ireland ü§≠ | Yup. Just double checked and Japanese is on the list. | [Buusuu](https://www.busuu.com/en/mobile) is a bit like Duolingo in its format but honestly hundred times better. It actually explains things, has clips of native speakers, and a ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù where you can get feedback and support from native speakers whenever a lesson gets you to write or speak a particular sentence freehand.  
  
It does now display a short ad after every lesson in attempt to convince you to pay which is annoying (although I like their jingle). Can download lessons for offline use (if you pay) which can be useful.  
  
Only things I miss about Duolingo (which you should -not- use to learn Japanese) that‚Äôs lacking in Buusuu is a table of all the characters with sounds for convenient access and lessons that teach you how to draw the characters on-screen (though it encourages you to do it by hand which is more sensible tbh).  
  
Otherwise [JapanesePod101](https://www.japanesepod101.com) is an amazing free resource which one of my friends swears by, and she not only lived in Japan for several years but became pretty fluent too. She even ended up paying for the premium subscription (which is currently on sale for 40% off until 20th September). | I got by fine with a couple of words and Google translate last year. It's a beautiful country. | I have some recommendations for Japanese:

[You should probably check some reviews though. I am neither an expert in Japanese nor an expert in language learning] | The Japanese courses were great. I did a trial back in the day and it pretty much takes you from pre-school - adult lessons. So you learn just about everything. | Yea that was a bummer. I took a hiatus and did some traveling early this summer and thought I'd be able to pick up some of the basics when I visited but it wasn't on there.

I've got a solid workflow down that allows me to pretty quickly knock out a video, I guess I just don't want to rock that boat. But maybe it's time. | You're right, I just don't want to re-learn something that I currently have a good workflow down. I do know that I have some plugins that aren't available for Resolve, as well as some animations and motion graphics that I've created and use in every video. Porting all that stuff over also takes time and a learning curve for something I've spent a while streamlining. | Yeah I used to pay for it for a very long time and then I decided to cancel it and they made it very difficult, I got into a lot of arguments with their customer support and in the end I had to change my bank card so that they would stop charging me money I didn't want to give them and that they had no right for. Fuck Adobe. | Funny enough I have two buddies that are bass players that started as bass players.  They are both fantastic. | Bass and punk...you could be a punk rock bass player by this afternoon | You're ignoring the part where the reason they took it down is because even though they owned 5 physical copies they loaned out unlimited copies during covid. 
That was the crux of the lawsuit | Does it offer Public Lending Rights payments to authors or their copyright holders after their death? | Nobody, including libraries, are allowed to make digital copies of books without permission and then lend them out. Full stop. That's why they lost. Jason Scott is going to get personally reamed as well for conspiracy to commit mass copyright infringement by publicly telling people to upload their own copyrighted material with zero disregard for the law. | The local library has a digital license to lend. Small but important legal distinction. | They loaned unlimited copies during covid, which moved their digital lending from legally grey (lending on a strict 1-1 basis of digital to physical) to very much illegal. | How should authors be paid for their work if not by holding copyright? As well as everyone else involved in releasing a work, publishers, editors, etc. 

Not arguing, just curious of the solution you have in mind. Licensing for organisations tends to pass the cost to consumer anyway through subscriptions etc, or rely on outside support (eg library funding from councils) | I also agree that authors should only be made of the independently wealthy and should in no way receive compensation for their work. | Hoopla and Libby books without a kindle option are the reason I got an android ereader.

I'm sure I could learn a few things from CS50, but I already have professional experience at web development. Do you think I'd learn much? It's a long course and I'd hate to sit through hours just to pick out a few new things. | Did you end up using python throughout your learning phase or does the cs50 course require you to use other languages? | Dw i was just joking, im doing good but thank you for the adviceüôÇ | I mean you will complete the course but you will definitely learn less.

I'm used to thinking about ~$30 a seat Enterprise ones.

But I'd still say, if all you want is storage, the dedicated backup companies still offer a good deal in terms of speed, features and focus of the product compared to putting stuff on OneDrive. | Yeah, for learning the ‚Äúalphabet‚Äù system it‚Äôs good, and it can also be useful for learning new vocabulary. But learning the actual language? God no. Especially as it seems to have more of an intent on pushing you to just do well in the leaderboards and pay for a subscription.  
  
I‚Äôm also not sure if it‚Äôs true, but I heard that they intend to replace all the voice actors with AI (if they haven‚Äôt already). | Austrian huh? Well g'day mate! Let's put another shrimp on the barbie! | Probably $1.50 a day. The do also outsource to 3rd world countries. | I gave it strawberry it say it only have 2 r but I wrote it with 3 r | Cool to know they can be rebuilt. I'd do it myself just because I'd want to know how to do it when I need to change it.

Maybe I'll download Resolve tonight and start checking it out. | Laborers being able to enjoy the fruits of their labor is important too. Creative labor, like writing a book, is still labor. What IA did was stealing the labor of tens of thousands of authors.

We aren't talking about them preserving rare or out-of-print books, they were throwing the newest bestsellers that are readily available at your local bookstore and for which the laborer would have been justly compensated.

US copyright law is far perfect and desperately needs some reform, but what IA did was just blatant theft. | I originally ordered Boox's Note Air 3 from Amazon but delivery kept getting delayed. I later found out that the manufacturer discontinued the model so I went with the Note Air 3C. I was worried that the NA3C's screen would be too dark compared to my Kindle Paperwhite SE but it's perfectly serviceable.

My choices were somewhat limited because I wanted something with Android 12 | Hey thanks for the response. Yeah I‚Äôm more frontend and my backend is kinda lacking. But you‚Äôre right I also feel it would be better to just do more backend tasks or the backend route of full stack open. 

Do you remember any of the best things CS50 taught you? | Interesting. How did you get on with the python crash course book? It‚Äôs a long read and I am half way through. Was thinking of switching to Automate the boring stuff as the projects in there are a bit more practical. | Just keep in mind that ChatGPT is not always accurate, so I wouldn't rely on it alone. | and how do you know it isn't just going to spit out convincing sounding garbage lol"
What ‚Äúlong song‚Äù (6+ minutes) is worth every minute? ,"Nobody‚Äôs said Won‚Äôt Get Fooled Again. It‚Äôs hope, rage, revolution and disillusionment and a sunglasses-donning scream. | Dance Yrself Clean ‚Äî LCD Soundsystem | Funkadelic - Maggot Brain | Paranoid Android | I used to call radio stations and request *Blue Monday*. As soon as it was over I would call back and say, ‚ÄúCan you play it again? I missed it‚Äù and every time they would be like ‚ÄúAre you kidding? It‚Äôs like a 7 minute song!‚Äù

Good times. | Sinnerman by Nina Simone | The Mariners Revenge Song by the Decemberists | Comfortably Numb. Especially David Gilmour at Pompeii. | Just The Two of Us - Grover Washington Jr. and Bill Withers | Achilles Last Stand | Innerbloom - R√úF√úS DU SOL | Dopesmoker - Sleep | Knights of Cydonia by Muse. | Pyramids - Frank Ocean | Shine On You Crazy Diamond - Pink Floyd | Lateralus | The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald | Roundabout by Yes | Let it Happen - Tame Impala | Waltz of the Flowers by Tchaikovsky is one of my favorite longer songs.

Computer Love, Kraftwerk

I Feel Love, Donna Summer (original 12"" version) | [removed] | Xanadu-Rush | Echoes by Pink Floyd

It is such an amazing song... Quite a musical journey. | My picks would be:  
 

Maggot Brain (Funkadelic): it is one long guitar solo and also maybe the most moving instrumental I've ever heard.  George Clinton supposedly told Eddie Hazel to ""play like you just found out your mama died"", and he nails it.

Blackstar (David Bowie): The song feels alien in a way that few Bowie songs do, but it somehow also straddles the feel of a lot of eras of Bowie's career in one song (sometimes all at once). | Bat out of hell by meatloaf | Gonna throw my hat in.

Multiple songs from the Disintegration album by The Cure (namely, the title track, Same Deep Water, and Prayers for Rain.)

Also, In Keeping Secrets by Coheed and Cambria. One of my faves. | Albuquerque - Weird Al | A Little Piece of Heaven - avenged sevenfold | The Doors - The End (11 min lmao) | Dogs - Pink Floyd | 1. Stairway to heaven
2. Hotel California
3. November Rain | Dire Straits - Telegraph Road (Live) (Remix) from the Money for Nothing compilation. | The Lightning Strike by Snow Patrol 16+ minutes, it‚Äôs actually like 3 songs each one beautiful.

It is so good. And little piece of heaven by avenged sevenfold. | Soothsayer - Buckethead. Zero lyrics, just Buckethead doing what he does best. | Lover, You Should‚Äôve Come Over by Jeff Buckley | Riders on the Storm by The Doors

Black Emperor. 16:25 of pure atmosphere and apocalypse. | The Camera Eye - Rush.

Heroin: The Velvet Underground 
Oh! Sweet nuthin: The Velvet Underground | Iron Lung by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. And also, The Dripping Tap by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. | Venice Bitch by Lana Del Rey | Jesus of Suburbia by Green Day | Most long Tool songs, but right now I'm going with 10,000 Days (Wings part 2) | ‚ÄúAutobahn‚Äù by Kraftwerk | Suppers Ready - Genesis | I'm Your Captain (Closer to Home) - Grand Funk

My favorite song by them. (Yes, it's a cover) | Hurricane-Bob Dylan. Tells an amazing story about a black boxer that was wrongly sent to jail. Has great pace for such a long song and the chorus is top notch. | Alice‚Äôs Restaurant by Alro Guthrie | Riders on the storm, and The End by the Doors | Paradise by the Dashboard Light by Meat Loaf | Impossible Soul - Sufjan Stevens 25min

Even The Silver Cord extended cuts funnily enough | Iron Maiden - When the Wild Wind Blows. | Dogs - Pink Floyd | Almost any song by Dragonforce.

This was such a nostalgia bomb for me and I know what I‚Äôm getting into this week now ‚ù§Ô∏è




Lots of Sigur Ros | Lune by Periphery

Backstory: Singer wrote the song for his girlfriend, but the drummer interprets it as being for one of his dogs that has just died. He nails the whole 7:46 song in one take, apparently weeping the whole time. Pure emotion in a drum track‚Ä¶ | Oh Comely by Neutral Milk Hotel | Supper's Ready by Genesis. Best long song ever | Komm, s√ºsser Tod

by ARIANNE, from the Evangelion series. | So many: We will fall - stooges; Good morning, Captain - slint; Armageddon man - black flag; the four horsemen - Metallica; into the void - black sabbath; boris-Melvins; Nerves - Bauhaus; holy wars‚Ä¶the punishment due - megadeth; and to top it off with some jazz: Wind Parade - Donald Byrd | Marquee Moon | Prog Fans: uhhh all of them? | The Trapeze Swinger- Iron and Wine | Anesthetize

Cygnus X1 Book II: Hemispheres by rush (the fans just call it hemispheres, don‚Äôt worry about the title just sit back and enjoy)

Then 2112.  

Then natural science. 

And then one day you‚Äôll feel ready for Xanadu but I‚Äôd highly recommend you listen to the live version from their ‚Äòexit stage left‚Äô album first. It‚Äôs unbelievable. 

And now you‚Äôre a rush fan. Sorry about that! | Firth of Fifth - Genesis | Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto no 2
Also no 3 | Black Magic Woman by Santana | The rime of an ancient mariner. The obvious, definitive answer imo | Hotel California - Eagles | Pick a random Opeth song. Listen to it. You're welcome | ""1983...(A Merman I Should Turn to Be)"" by The Jimi Hendrix Experience is a psychedelic masterpiece. It's the trippiest song on Jimi's trippiest album Electric Ladyland.  It's about this dude who wants to become a merman, but society won't let him. A highlight is Mitch Mitchell's drumming during the underwater sequence. After the song ends there are some freaky UFO sounds as well. | Ghost Love Score by Nightwish | Daft Punk - Touch | Every track on Joanna Newsom's Ys album. Only Skin if I had to pick just one. 

Also Dire Straits Telegraph Road and a handful of Pink Floyd songs. | Blackwater Park by Opeth. | Supper‚Äôs Ready or Cinema Show, both by Genesis.

In particular, Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Hallowed Be Thy Name, Phantom of the Opera and The Talisman | Age of Machine by Greta Van Fleet | Tool pushit live version | Infected mushroom - dancing with kadafi | Emily, by Joanna Newsom | I know it‚Äôs not 6 minutes, but sleep forever by Portugal the man.

Don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs technically 2 songs | Dance With The Devil - Immortal Technique | Dry County - Bon Jovi | Xanadu by Rush.

Three Days by Jane's Addiction

Three Days by Jane's Addiction | Bruce Springsteen - Jungleland | In Memory of Elizabeth Reed off the Allman Brothers Live at Fillmore East album.

Long live the boss | Black Sabbath - War pigs

Man, that is a hell of a song. Literally | Opeth - Black Rose Immortal. | Green eyes- Erykah Badu | Implements of destruction -Chimera 

Ghost of Perdition -opeth

Lateralus -tool | Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen, although 6‚Äú short of 6‚Äò. But it‚Äôs too good to not mention it. | Child in time by deep purple | Aqueous Transmission by Incubus | Child in Time - Deep Purple | New York City Serenade by Bruce Springsteen (and the E-Street Band).

Experimental rock and it's dope af | Window of the Waking Mind - Coheed & Cambria | ‚ÄúDo I Do,‚Äù by Stevie Wonder. 10:26 of absolute joy. | 2112 by Rush. | Original live version of Sweet Jane by Lou Reed | Hi Ren, Money Game part 3 | Anything that is Tool (third eye is fantastic) and porcupine tree (especialy anesthetize). | Coma - Guns n Roses | Hi Ren | Dave - Heart Attack | The Poet and the Pendulum (Nightwish) | ‚ÄúI Just Want To Sell Out My Funeral‚Äù - The Wonder Years | ORION - METALLICA ü§òüèªü§òüèª | Cold little heart - michael kiwanuka | Xanadu by Rush,
2112 by Rush,

Far and away the best song on 72 Seasons, IMO. | [iron sky by Paulo Nutini](https://youtu.be/ELKbtFljucQ?si=_LRUJ3TxOPD7_I1Y)

This song saved my life several times | ""[Time](https://youtu.be/Qr0-7Ds79zo?si=T6QeRsvwdF_XzBwV)"" by Pink Floyd off Dark Side of the Moon - 7:05 | 2112 by Rush. | As, Stevie Wonder. | Scenes from an Italian Restaurant- Billy Joel

Two of my karaoke favorites. Value karaoke as i like to say. | That song from Beetlejuice ^2. | The Count of Tuscany and/or Octavarium- Dream Theater | So many jazz songs. Too many to list. | Do mashups count?    
  
The Hood Internet made a series of videos ""[50 songs  in 3 minutes from <year>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OjiFcvrO3c&list=PLqrkwSi3LHneR8zHLgCnuFLCE76Qwm2iE)"", for each year from 1975 to 2009. Each 3 minute mashup is spectacular.

But then they put them together into decades.

Here's [1990-1999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2w6yHaoyOo) (34 minutes long). | Away From the Mire by Billy Strings | Hotel California - Eagles (Live Acoustic version)

One of the best song of all time. | Emily, by Joanna Newsom | The Lamb and the Dragon by Ludo | Siberian Breaks - MGMT | Prologue by Kamasi Washington.

It‚Äôs like getting shit out of a cannon and receiving oral sex while heroin while being face to face Jesus. | ‚ÄúSong for Bob‚Äù by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis | Kamasi Washington - Truth | Metallica - One | Blackwater Park - Opeth | 7empest, parabol/parabola, Rosetta stoned | Stan Eminem. This song created a word in pop culture and was the first rap song to have a full story, truly a masterpiece. | ‚ÄúWild Time‚Äù by Weyes Blood

‚ÄúOver and Over‚Äù by Beach House | One - Metallica | The Decline, NOFX | Tetragrammaton by The Mars Volta | ‚ÄúGiorgio by Moroder‚Äù by Daft Punk. Amazing climax in that one. | octavarium by dream theater.  The intro section of that song alone is damn near 6 minutes | The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald by Gordon Lightfoot | Kashmir | Mariner's Revenge Song by the Decemberists | Soothsayer by Buckethead | Riviera Paradise - Stevie Ray Vaughan | In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida. As Homer Simpson pointed out ""We used to make out to this hymn."" Bohemiam Rhapsody comes it at just 6 minutes (or slightly less) but that should be close enough and it is worth every second. | Pendulum - The Tempest | Miracles, by Jefferson Starship | The Decline by NoFX.

When a band known for churning out 30 second songs suddenly releases a 17 minute epic, it's worth finding out why | The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys by Traffic is on a whole other level https://youtu.be/vDGorIWYz-A?si=50HDGrQDw15CB3vq | November Rain - Guns and Roses

This is a song that should be used in movies, trust me, or at least a trailer (if any movie devs use this idea, I wanna be notified) | 2112 overture by rush | Donnie Darko by Let‚Äôs Eat Grandma | Iron Maiden has a few, like Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Paschendale. Also, Albuquerque by Weird Al. | Bleak by opeth | Dante's Inferno by Iced Earth

Harlequin Forest by Opeth | Mirrors - Justin Timberlake | I'm torn between Failure or Planet of the Apes by Devin Townsend. 

This live version of Failure probably edges it out for me though
https://youtu.be/gimBc_3Oz6U?si=BM7a5eid0T5rgd4H | La Villa Strangiato by Rush | Meatloaf; Objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are. | Achilles come down | I have been enjoying one of the new songs from Fred Again..'s latest album. [Fred again.. x Duskus x Four Tet x Skrillex x Joy Anonymous - glow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ9rssRq-FI) | Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.  The way it changes tempos, the clever lyrics, the harmonies...
Plus it's a perfect BPM for my running tempo. | disintegration - the cure | Innerbloom by Rufus Du Sol | Pretty much every song by Pink Floyd. | In da gada da Vida.¬†


Theres a short version and a 17 minute version. It so good¬† | Layla | 10 years gone- Led Zeppelin. Would also add rain song | Bury the Light | Desolation row - Bob Dylan¬†
When in Rome - Phil ochs¬† | Anything by the Grateful Dead | Cold Little Heart by Michael Kiwanuka | Oldie by Odd Future

It‚Äôs a totally different genre than most of the other songs here, but what the song represents means a lot to me. I came of age in high school listening to and enjoying Tyler the Creator, Earl, and other various artists under the Odd Future umbrella. There works were often splintered into individual projects while their collaborations, while frequent, were limited to 1 or 2 members of the group at a time. For me, Oldie, which is a meandering, cypher-style, 10 minute rap song, brings together this massive ensemble cast of artists into a single song/video and lets they show their talents. Everyone gets to rap a verse. They spit some crazy bars, with Frank Ocean‚Äôs and Earl‚Äôs verses standing out for me. But really the song isn‚Äôt about the lyrics, it feels like a family reunion that you got invited to. 

The video is a lot of fun too, seemingly shot on a whim during an unrelated Terry Richardson photoshoot, with him in the video clearly protesting against the timing of the spur of the moment music video shoot taking place in his studio. | Shogun - Trivium | Empire of the clouds by iron maiden or full metal jackoff by jello biafra | The War On Drugs - ‚ÄûAn Ocean In Between The Waves‚Äú | Bela lugosis dead by bauhaus, 9min 36sec.
Brilliant bit if goth memory when listening to this.. | Light of the Seven by Ramin Djawadi | Evie parts 1,2 and 3 by Stevie Wright

Most of their songs are 7+ minutes long and can go from brutal death to amazing prog in a really natural progression.¬† Mikael Akerfeldt's singing voice just had a classic smoothness to it that will appeal to as lot of people. | Ren is a master of long songs that keep you at the edge of your chair. So I‚Äòd say either ‚ÄûHi Ren‚Äú or ‚ÄûMoney Game Part three‚Äú. | Layla by Derek and the dominos | Sweet child in time.  Deep purple live. | Helloween - Keeper of the Seven Keys  
https://open.spotify.com/track/4hbZZLWtyny0RYQw8ncYKK | Disintegration by Jimmy eat world | *Achilles Come Down* by Gang of Youths.

Its a journey. | All things to all men - Cinematic Orchestra | Coloratura by Coldplay | Anberlin - fin.

And 3 Days, Jane's Addiction | Rhapsody in Blue by George Gershwin. It might not stick to a definitive style, but it does it well. | *Fin by Anberlin | Dire Straits - Brothers in Arms | Iowa by Slipknot | Lazarus by David Bowie

What a song to say goodbye with, love the music video too. | Atom Heart Mother by Pink Floyd | Sultans of Swing by Dire Straits - Alchemy Live  (~10 mins long).

Fool‚Äôs Overture - Supertramp | Daft Punk - Giorgio | Famous Prophets (Stars) Car Seat Headrest that one clocks in at 16 mins but such a good song | november rain by guns n roses 100% | The prodigy - voodoo people | The Greatest Show on Earth.

It's the perfect closing track, and my wife and kids know that if it comes on while we're in the car, we're listening to all 16 minutes of it. | Echoes - Pink Floyd¬†


Shine on you Crazy Diamond - Pink Floyd¬† | Pull Me Under - Dream Theater | Revolution 9. | The Great Escape by Seventh Wonder. 

It's a song written as accompaniment to the poem Aniara about the last remaining humans fleeing into space for a hopefully better life and world as we, the rest of humanity, have destroyed the earth and turned into an ashpile. 

It's legitimately a masterpiece. | Bye bye miss American pie | Foreplay-long time by Boston. | Lateralus | [Rosetta Stoned - TOOL](https://open.spotify.com/track/0D8l86LXxKcgKAO17DfQsl?si=46fc8459ec5d4187)

Some people may not like the minute of bird noises but it's so good and the song doesn't hit the same without it.¬† | Paradise by the Dashboard Light by Meat Loaf | Free bird | Eagles - Hotel California | Stairway to Heaven | Working Man- Rush | Any Metallica song | Bohemian Rhapsody | the weight of dreams by greta van fleet | Found God in a Tomato. Especially if it's late at night, it's worth every minute and it's almost 9 minutes long. | Michael Jackson - Wanna Be Startin Somethin is longer than Thriller | Jaguar god by mastodon should get a mention here, especially that melodic solo.. | # Add 1 second to Bohemian Rhapsody and that's the perfect 6+ minutes

# | Starless or any track off of "" larks tongues in aspic"" ( king crimson) | Hey Jude | 23 by Jimmy Eat World. It builds nicely, has an interesting main riff, and it is super relatable. | For me, I‚Äôm opting: Motionless - She Got Lost In The Laboratory | Gotta be Close to the Edge - Yes | Mahler Symphony no.6 | Rosalita Bruce Springsteen. I think it's something like 13 minutes. Such an awesome live song | ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" by Queen is a long song that‚Äôs worth every minute. | Most tool songs | Low Spark of High Heeled Boys by Traffic. | American Pie - Don McLean | And then there was silence by Blind Guardian. 14 minutes of glory. | Dove X Cymande

Black Emperor | The Czar - Mastodon | Stairway to heaven | Stairway to Heaven
Every single Second is a Masterpiece | Free Bird by lynyrd skynyrd

Edit: The Album version | Let It Happen by Tame Impala | Stan | The Mariner‚Äôs Revenge Song by The Decemberists

Very dark revenge story | Peter Gabriel Era Genesis from 1968 to 1975. ‚ÄúFirth Of Fifth‚Äù has one of the best guitar solos of all time. Also, ‚ÄúSupper‚Äôs Ready‚Äù is a great mini rock opera. Peter Gabriel also had a way of taking mundane stories that he read in the newspaper and making them epic. | Dancing like flames - Lorna Shore. | Swim To The Moon by Between the Buried and Me. | The summoning by sleep tokenü•∞ | Suite: Judy Blue Eyes by Crosby, Stills & Nash. | Racing in the streets - Bruce Springsteen | Visions of Johana - Bob Dylan | The Allman Brothers - Jessica | FREEBIRD !!!

Anything from Periphery. I've been listening back to Wax Wings lately and it slaps just as it did when I first heard it | How soon is now - The Smiths 

That was my bathroom song when I had a radio show in college and no one else was in the studio. | Mirrors - Justin Timberlake, anyone? | If your feeling brave? Probably most Tool double feature songs. 

Wings Pt. 1 > 2.  
Lost Keys > Rosetta Stoned.  
Intension > Right in Two.  
Parabol > Parabola.  
DRT.  


As for single songs?

Pneuma, Invincible, The Grudge, Lateralus, Eulogy, Jambi, Vicarious. | Shine on you crazy diamond | The Trapeze Swinger by Iron & Wine | Antonio Vivaldi - four seasons (all of them). | Teardrop Massive Attack | Dance Yourself Clean - LCD Soundsystem | Terrapin station | Paradise by the Dashboard Light by Meatloaf. | What goes around comes around - Justin Timberlake

Hanuman Chalisa - Krishna Das | I - Meshuggah | mariners revenge by the decemberists | Queen - every song over 6m | Any of the weekend‚Äôs early music | The decline | fear of the dark and hallowed be thy name, by iron maiden | Jungleland by Bruce Springsteen | Echoes Pink Floyd
Arriving somewhere but not here  Porcupine Tree | Bohemian rhapsody. It‚Äôs actually 5‚Äô55‚Äù so I‚Äôm saying any live version of the song. Surely that would make it 6 minutes. | Beethoven 7th symphony 2nd movement¬† | Spitting Venom, Truckers Atlas, Other People's Lives, Edit the Sad Parts, and Stars are Projectors by Modest Mouse.

My general rule of thumb for Modest Mouse is if the song is over 5 minutes it's probably a good one - they need room to breathe for their music. | Mirrors by Justin Timberlake | Love Hangover by Diana Ross | Hi Ren (by Ren). But you do have to watch the music video. It is a masterfully done work of art the whole way through | Ramin Djawadi - The Night King | *fin - Anberlin (if you‚Äôre into 2000‚Äôs alt rock) | Peter Cat Recording Co - Memory Box | Comforting sounds - Mew | war pigs by black sabbath, all day every day | I always find it interesting to come these lists and scroll to see I know about 2 songs. 

People comment shit like

Zombie Boner Fart - The Twisted Climax Donkey Teeth

OMG I can‚Äôt believe I had to scroll down this far to see this!!! | The decline by NOFX | Mirror - Justin Timberlake | Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen. At over 5 minutes, it‚Äôs just shy of 6, but it‚Äôs a classic with its unique structure and powerful vocals. For something longer, try Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin, which is about 8 minutes long and celebrated for its iconic guitar solo and epic progression. | Rapper's Delight by Sugarhill Gang. Comes in at 14:37 | Schism by TOOL is 6:40‚Ä¶ | Maggot brain | The Band Played Waltzing Matilda, by The Pogues. So, so good. It kills me every time I listen to it. | Rosalita - Bruce Springsteen | ‚ÄúAlbuquerque‚Äù by ‚ÄúWeird Al‚Äù Yankovic | The End by The Doors | I‚Äôm not in love - 10cc
&
Moments in Love - The Art of Noise | Michael Jackson - Dangerous | Freebird. | A case of separating the artist from the art these days, but Layla by Derek and the Dominos. 

53 years old and still the greatest love song ever written. | Deltron 3030- Del the Funky Homosapien

Trohbleman by Electric Guest | Was wondering why I didn't see Bohemian Rhapsody towards the top then I looked up the setting.

November Rain  
Bohemian Rhapsody

Damn need to start a playlist now | Mirrors - Justin Timberlake | Ripples - Genesis | Isn't Mirrors by Justin Timberlake an 8 minute song?? Omg so good though | Reptile - Periphery | Alice‚Äôs Restuarant | Stairway to Heaven - Led Zeppelin | Cortez the Killer - Neil Young | Green Grass and High Tides forever | All Too Well - TSwift | Nyancat | Cold Little Heart -  Michael Kiwanuka | I scrolled too far before seeing THE answer. I don‚Äôt care if you think it‚Äôs a cliche, this song is the ultimate banger of a long song. It‚Äôs perfect. 

Bohemian Rhapsody- Queen. 

Other answers on the list are good. Great even. But no other long song is as universally recognized and loved. 

I will die on this hill.

EDIT: just decided to check my work and found my pick is only 5:54‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I know what you‚Äôre all
Going to say but it‚Äôs still the right answer | Bat Out of Hell by Meatloaf | Jesus of suburbia | Jesus of Suburbia - Green Day | 1812 Overtute | In A Sea of Flames by Lorna Shore | undertale ost 71 | Free bird, why haven‚Äôt I seen it mentioned yet üò≠ | The Decline - NOFX (18 minutes) | Metallica - Orion

Composed by the former bass player (Cliff Burton, RIP) it's an eight minute thrash song that has a lot of classical influence. Been my favorite metal song since I was like 8 and I found the track on my moms iPod | Lateralus - Tool | Any song by Tool | Paradise by the Dashboard Light - Meatloaf

Probably one of the top 5 songs of the century. | Paradise by the dashboard lights - Meatloaf | ‚ÄúRiders on the Storm‚Äù by The Doors

For your eyez only | 2112 | Konstantine - Something Corporate ü´∂üèºü´∂üèºü´∂üèºü´∂üèº | Pretty much any Pink Floyd song. | Ball and Biscuit | Maybe it‚Äôs overrated but Taylor Swift - All to Well is really hit | All too well - Taylor Swift, the writing and story telling is perfect (I m not a fan) | Television - Marquee Moon | Because it gives me a chuckle every time I hear it and is not a serious song at all‚Ä¶. Pillow Talking by Lil Dicky. It‚Äôs like 11-12 minutes. And if you‚Äôve dated random people before or had ONS you will also have a chuckle. | November Rain by Guns and Roses | Limp Bizkit Everything

(on that note: [Periphery - Satellites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAXQxAkcL78)) | Stan - Eminem | ‚ÄúBohemian Rhapsody‚Äù by Queen is definitely worth every second. Its mix of rock and opera keeps it engaging from start to finish, and the sheer creativity makes it unforgettable. | All Too Well (10-minute version) by Taylor Swift | Taylor Swift, All Too Well | Last Kiss (Taylor‚Äôs Version) | definitely gotta say Bohemian Rhapsody... like that song is a whole opera in 6 minutes. can‚Äôt get enough of those vibes | American pie. It‚Äôs super long, but it‚Äôs also one of the only songs I can sing every single word to without music. | I'd do anything for love, but I won't do that by Meatloaf, a classic!! | Euphoria - Kendrick Lamar | Really confused why Michael Jackson's Earth song isn't here already. | Every Tool song. | Heal the World by Michael Jackson¬† | Will You Be There - Michael Jackson | windowlicker - aphex twin (6:06)

amazing song from an amazing album that I doubt a lot of people know. would recommend if you got 10 min to spare | ‚ÄúFrom the cradle to the grave‚Äù - Subhumans | Starship trooper/wurm,  by yes | Stairway was my first vote but let's bring him some Jazz/ BigBand with Sing Sing Sing by the Benny Goodman band    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRBboAZqQPA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRBboAZqQPA) | This.

https://youtu.be/inqC_yDCfc4?si=McPKj0_ABp16auL5 | Closet Chronicles by Kansas | GAUPA- Febersvan | Frost - Vertical Horizon | ITIIITIATIIHYLIHYL by Blackshape. Love every second of it | Any song on a Goose set. | Albuquerque by Weird Al. | Spirit crusher | Echoes by Pink Floyd | Toccata and Fugue in D Minor by Bach. Still my favorite song of all time. | Saint Saens' ""Organ Symphony"", particularly the finale. Be sure to set your speakers to 11. | Hallowed be thy name. | Avantasia - The Raven Child | Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen. It‚Äôs like a mini-opera packed into a song! Every section hits differently, and you just can‚Äôt help but sing along. | Just for the climax- Phil Collins | In the air

It's 16 minutes long but it is great. I say that as someone who usually hates long songs as well. | All By Myself - Eric Carmen.

The pop part is great, the dreamy guitar solo is great, the classical part is great: it's all great. | Untitled- knuckle puck

Never fails to get me with the slow guitar playing over ""I'll tell you everything is copacetic"" | Highway song by Blackfoot. The album version. | I was at a Ben Folds concert a few years ago, he did a version of ""Narcolepsy"" that was about 8-10 minutes long, and it absolutely floored me. | Shine on you crazy diamond by Pink Floyd = 20 minutes of euphoria | The Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota by Weird Al Yankovic | American Pie | This one! 

[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xz6OGVCdov8](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xz6OGVCdov8) | Wardruna - White Raven. | Scenes from an Italian Restaurant | Do You Feel Like We Do? - Peter Frampton | Knights of Cydonia by muse. 

No one‚Äôs gonna take me alive! | Bohemian Rhapsody.  No cap. | the party & the after party - the weeknd | Trapped in the Drive Thru (10 minutes).

I wonder how many people remember this one. | Led Zeppelin‚Äôs ‚ÄúStair Way To Heaven.‚Äù | Almost any Pink Floyd song (or album) | XNOR XNOR XNOR by Frums | All 25 minutes and 35 seconds of Sufjan Steven‚Äôs *Impossible Soul* | Quarantine by MuteMath.  The album Odd Soul in general is fantastic. | [Hocus Pocus by Focus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV0F_XiR48Q) | Starless by King Crimson, dogs by pink floyd, and heart of the sunrise by yes. | Dopesmoker by Sleep. | Bohemian Rhapsody.  6 minutes! | Maggot Brain by Funkadelic | Let It Happen - Tame Impala | let it happen - tame impala | November rain | Logic's Last Call | Candy Licker - Marvin Sease | Voiceless Screaming, by X Japan.

Not the best english lyrics, but when I was a teen, it fit the sad days rather well.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-YISMhMIuU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-YISMhMIuU) | Achilles Last Stand -Zeppelin | Washer by Slint | Runaway

And I always find  
And I always find something wrong | Deeper Well from Emmylou Harris and Spyboy Live. Whole album is great | The Decline by NoFx | The guitar solos (both of them) in Comfortably Numb. | In your eyes, live version from the secret world tour. Peter Gabriel. 

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=EgMCQizwEsw&si=DGc_fBquqYm240NO | My Dying Time by Led Zeppelin | L.M.L.Y.P. By ween | American Pie by Don McLean | It‚Äôs not exactly what you asked, but musicals fill this niche for me. I put a musical on and enjoy the music and listen to the story play out. 

I would suggest Hamilton or The Book of Mormon | ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù by Dave Grohl | ‚ÄúShine on you Crazy Diamond‚Äù by Pink Floyd | Tool - vicarious | Scenes From an Italian Restaurant by Billy Joel | ‚ÄúBlackstar‚Äù David Bowie and ‚ÄúMurder Most Foul‚Äù Bob Dylan. Truly dark pieces of art. | Temple of Syrinx, more worth it than any long LZ song and I am a huge LZ fan | India/Mountain Time by Joe Bonamassa. Particularly the live version from Live From Nowhere In Particular. | Take control by the old gods of Asgard | Death of death by Iron Maiden | I really love Coma by Guns N' Roses. All their long songs really, Estranged, Prostitute, and of course November Rain | Knights of Cydonia by Muse

Honorable mention goes to Krwlng by Linkin Park because it‚Äôs 5 and a half minutes. Every once in a while that song just hits me right | In The Court Of The Crimson King | I really like We Love You by Avenged Sevenfold | Pain Remains (Pt 1, 2 and 3) by Lorna Shore.  If you don't know about Extreme Metal, then listen to the first 30 seconds of Pt 2.  It's not for everyone.  The music video is epic (but sad) as well. | ""On the Painted Dessert"" Boom Boom Satellites. | Warsaw by Them Crooked Vultures | Stairway to Heaven | Knocked up by kings of Leon | JMSN - Love 2 U

If you've never heard it before, put on some good headphones turn off the lights, lie on the floor and [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuyvLzcnSeI). | Dire Straits - Sultans Of Swings [live](https://youtu.be/eqxpQA5etd4?si=1knAHxN22jycaxfD) version. | Bummer by Harry Chapin

In fact, most Harry Chapin songs would qualify. | The End by The Doors. | Pink Floyd | Bach-busoni: chaconne in D minor (piano) | Drive Home by Steven Wilson | I like Girl Talk, if he counts. | Hope - Fat Freddy‚Äôs Drop | In the light by Led Zeppelin. They got a shit ton though. Kashmir, Rain Song etc. | Separating the art from the artist, there are some long songs on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy that absolutely crush every second:

Monster

Runaway

Blame Game

That whole album front to back is a great way to spend an hour | Rose of Pain | Goodbye Sky Harbor - Jimmy Eat World 

Instrumental for most of it but beautiful to me nonetheless | Symphony no 3 - Henryk G√≥recki, thank me later | Art of Life by X Japan | -[Touch Me I'm Going To Scream, Pt. 2 by My Morning Jacket](https://open.spotify.com/track/5x4Tv2PICzkwkixYuSmbYX?si=C-rybz_PT9uOadLERb_4Iw)

-[In the Company of Wolves by Incubus](https://open.spotify.com/track/2XCCNN8Z30n0DXsV2vZR8c?si=jRA5GgKUR7SOmwfXCsdNPA)


All quite different but absolute gems. I never get bored listening to these like some long songs. üòä | Every song from Pink Floyd | Let it Be - The Beatles 

One i didn't see here. Iirc it's the song that made other longer songs play worthy on the radio. | ""Get Ready"" by Rare Earth | Al Stewart -  Roads to Moscow | John butler with ocean.. 12 minutes of an epic guitar solo play.. | Bohemian Rhapsody | ‚ÄúMogwai Fear Satan‚Äù - Mogwai
It‚Äôs just a bit over 16 minutes and worth every single minute. | Last thoughts on Woody Guthrie. - Bob Dylan | Rhapsody in Blue | Siberian breaks by mgmt | Deathbed 

Or

One bourbon, one beer, one whisky or whatever that song is called. | Beautiful from Heathers the Musical slaps | Blues pt 2 - Blood, Sweat, and Tears | Hallowed Be Thy Name - Iron Maiden | The Score Evolved: Reel 1 (Diary) by Angels and Airwaves | The Wheel and the Maypole by XTC. | Innerbloom - Rufus du sol. Can‚Äôt believe no one‚Äôs said it yet | An example must be made by Deterioration¬† | The decline nofx | In My Darkest Hour - Megadeth | Art of Noise~Moments in Love | pyramids by frank ocean | Innerbloom - Rufus de sol | Sacred Worlds by Blind Guardian. Symphonic Metal üëçüèª | ""Foggy Dew"" --The Chieftans and Sinead O'Connor.  The live studio recording was done in one take and it's the most haunting thing you'll ever hear. | ""O Superman"" by Laurie Anderson | Strobe - Deadmau5 | Prophets song by Queen | Albuquerque - Weird Al | Let it happen tame impala | Jane Doe by Converge | ""Dream Oddessy"" by Mono. The lulling and lethargic tempo pulls me into the memories of the past for just a brief couple minutes... Love you grandma. | Argentina - Tokyo Police Club

Great song all round, *and* they usually play it at their live shows | [The Camera Eye - Rush](https://youtu.be/atdNxWnrbNo?si=jFEDL0pftlMoE9Z7) | I really like the lofi song Resurrections by Lena Raine (It‚Äôs 9:38 but I love it) | Pretty sure no one have covered this yet
[Aegleseeker(‚ÄúAfterworld‚Äù Full ver.)](https://youtu.be/x7BJ5ZXuYsk?si=xqUxmO-Rg5WmGx6z) | Hocus Pocus by Focus | ""One Long Day"" by Cold Chisel, 7 minutes 23 seconds. | Iron Maiden - *Rime of the Ancient Mariner* | Kathy's Song, by Simon and Garfunkel | Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts | [Here's My Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_XIjiV_Lxc) by Crowder | Pneumonia by Me Like Bees
Trapeze Swinger by Iron and Wine
Come on Feel the Illinoise by Sufjan Stevens | Russian Christmas Music | Someone mentioned American Pie but I used to do a cover of Vincent (both Don McLean) when I did cabaret and that is one of the best glorious sad songs I've ever had the pleasure to hear and sing. | In The Woods - Omnio, Pre, Bardo, Post. It's one song in three parts. | If you like piano and space rock, New Born by Muse.

Citizen Erased in the same album is really good too. | Because I'm an absolutely insane weirdo: Insane Clown Posse's ""Real Underground Baby"". Comes in at 17 minutes.


Also Clika One's ""Hide Da Pain"" coming in at 11 minutes | Ammonia Avenue by Alan Parsons Project | Can‚Äôt you hear me knocking by the stones. | When The Music‚Äôs Over - The Doors

Just delicious.. | Free Bird.¬† | Pink Floyd's Echoes. And Sheep. | Pink Floyd - High Hopes | Both Sibelius and Mendelssohn Violin concerti‚Ä¶.both are around 30 minutes in length. | If you like rap.  Jayz ‚Äúpoppin tags‚Äù | YEM phish | Sing about me, I‚Äôm dying of thirst by Kendrick Lamar. 12 minutes of the most in depth lyricism you‚Äôve ever listened to. Incredibly sad. 

In my opinion, it‚Äôs the best song of all time through every genre. I could write an essay on it easily, but I‚Äôll spare you the details and let you find them yourself. | Alice‚Äôs Restaurant | Echoes is a masterpiece. | Spitting Venom by Modest Mouse | ""Shhh""/""Peaceful"" and ""In a Silent Way""/""It's About That Time"" by Miles Davis. | Runaway by kanye | One probably very people have heard, but New Day by Karnivool | Long Distance Calling: Immunity | [The Day That Never Comes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkNfNR1WYMY) - Metallica | Tears for Fears has a song on their ‚ÄúSeeds of Love‚Äù album called ‚ÄúBadman‚Äôs Song.‚Äù Jazz, gospel, rock, and Oleta Adams ‚Äî nice. | Adore by Prince.  off of Sign O the Times. absolutely says what every man has been trying to say to every beautiful woman in the history of the universe,  The MFing UNIVERSE.  I can't stand it. where's my babygirl at? | Walk Like Thunder by Kimya Dawson for an offbeat answer. Be warned, it‚Äôs sad as hell. But in a ‚Äúhere‚Äôs how I‚Äôm dealing with it‚Äù kind of way. | 10hr video of Nyancat repeated. | The Crowing by Coheed and Cambria | [Father John Misty ‚Äî Pure Comedy](https://youtu.be/wKrSYgirAhc?si=6Ozqw3utOcPSphbg) | The Next Ten Minutes- from The Last Five Years | High Hopes - Pink Floyd | No Quarter-Led Zeppelin | Albuquerque or trapped in the drive thru by weird al yankovic. Not a minute wasted on either track | There have been some fantastic ones people have listed already, but I‚Äôm surprised nobody‚Äôs said:

21st Century Schizoid Man by King Crimson.

Also, while it‚Äôs less known: Any of Galneryus‚Äô longer stuff, particularly Angel of Salvation, The Force of Courage, and Bravehearts. It‚Äôs all such amazing music. | Biko - Peter Gabriel | In My World - The Moody Blues | Locomotive by Guns and Roses. The piano in the outro is insane. | Alleluia by Eric Whitacre | Alice's Restaraunt by Arlo Guthrie is a ride from start to finish. Drugs are bad, mmmkay? | Hotel California 
Sweet Child O Mine 
Stan | Loving County - Charlie Robison | Scarlet > Fire from Cornell 77 | Found God In A Tomato - Psychedelic Porn Crumpets | Montparnasse by Floating Points | red sex - vessel | Sign of the Cross - Iron Maiden | This might be my inner nerd coming through, but ""Keep Me Sane"" and ""Sicarius"" (both by Lyv) are both really good. | Iron Lung - King Gizz | One by Metallica.
Riders on the Storm by The Doors. | 2112 | Mirror Reaper by Bell Witch | Free bird - Lynyrd Skynyrd | Sons of Winter and Stars - Wintersun | Ghost love score by nightwish | Slint good morning captain | Achilles Last Stand by Led Zeppelin. 

10 minutes of absolute controlled insanity by the band. 

John Bonham‚Äôs drumming is absolutely bonkers. He makes that kit sound like a bunch of finessed cannons on that track and he fires multiple broadsides. Just when you think he can‚Äôt top his last broadside, he hits you with another one‚Ä¶only more powerful than the last. Some of his best work is on this song. 

Jimmy Page plays something like 7 different guitar parts on the song. 

Robert Plant was singing from a wheelchair due to an accident. 

John Paul Jones played an 8-string bass and rocks one of his best bass lines. 

Led Zeppelin is one of the best musical acts of all-time, but if you want to hear them firing on all cylinders for 10 solid minutes, give that track a listen. 

I read somewhere that Plant himself admitted that it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot a track you want to be left alone in a room with.‚Äù | Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts ~~Bob Dylan | Knights of Shame by AWOLNATION | ""Magic box"" by Genesis. Don't let the band put you off, this is a journey of a song which never let's you know what's going to happen next. Don't do drugs but if you do, pop this tune on. | Tunnel of Love - Dire Straits | American Pie by Don McLean | Bolero | November rain | The majority of Bob Dylan‚Äôs songs over 6+. Probably the most consistent in quality and quantity in regards to song length. Can make the case for some jazz or prog music perhaps, but as far as being able to hold your attention with a simple arrangement of words and music, Dylan‚Äôs an undisputed champion. | Hi REN, by REN is amazing to me. But you have to watch the music video for it. | Twilight Zone - Golden Earring | Radar Love | American Pie by Don McLean. | Apex Twin - Windowlicker 

But only if you have robot ears. | IS THIS THE REAL LIFE | Nights - Frank Ocean | Phish | Guinnevere - Miles Davis | Mirror Of Souls - Theocracy | Rosetta Stoned - Tool | Oc√©an, John Butler | **2112** - Rush.  
**Rime of the Ancient Mariner** - Iron Maiden. | Stairway | Green Day - Jesus of Suburbia | Weird Al. Albuquerque. | Innerbloom-Rufus Du Sol | I will possess your heart by deathcab for cutie | Pneuma | Hi Ren by Ren 
Money Game Part 3 by Ren

I got a few others but those are my two most recent favs | Maggot brain!!! | Don't remember the lenght, but Free Bird

Esit: just checked it's 9 minutes long | Hotel California | Waste of paint- bright eyes | A very wide selection of Led Zeppelin songs

My personal favorite being Kashmir | Not six minutes but almost 6 minutes: colm mcguinness‚Äôs cover of bohemian rhapsody | Siberian breaks 12 minutes of a masterpiece | Captain Morgan's Revenge - Alestorm | Green Grass and high tides.

But maybe that's because I can still see the Rock Band track when I listen to it and  close my eyes | Spitting Venom - Modest Mouse.  
Rasputin - Boney M. | pyramids - Frank Ocean | Phantom of the Opera - Iron Maiden | Acid Bath - The Blue | The Teacher - Foo Fighters | The Rain formerly Known As Purple - Chris Christodoulou | Runaway Kanye | Free bird | Life is Sweet (Daft Punk Remix) by The Chemical Brothers | Pink Floyd didn't write songs, they wrote albums. Queue the whole album, slip on the headphones, and turn off the lights. (Cannabis optional.) | DM - Painted in Exile

Dogs - Pink Floyd | Stairway to heaven | Covered in Rain - John Mayer | Knights of Cydonia by Muse | I Appear Missing by Queens of the Stone Age


The album version is 6:00 but the live version goes on for several more minutes and is worth every second live. | [When My Train Pulls In - Gary Clark Jr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFndWoAAi1k)

I'm assuming the repeating background guitar riff is a kind of musical onomatopoeia for a train. | Pyramids frank ocean | Dragonforce - Through fire and flames | **Shine On You Crazy Diamond** by Pink Floyd. It's almost 26 minutes if you count all parts, but it‚Äôs such a journey. The way the song builds up, the haunting guitar, the synths... pure magic. Every second just pulls you deeper into the atmosphere. | A little piece of heaven | Rooster by Alice in Chains. 

Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden.  I'm not quite sure if this one is long enough, but it's close.

Friends in Low Places (The Long Version) by Garth Brooks

Albuquerque by Weird Al Yankovic.   Thank me later. | Jesus of Suburbia | Pyramids by Frank Ocean | Jungleland | Lateralus by Tool gets my vote as one of my top 5 favorite songs of all time and clocking in at about 9 minutes. | 2112, by Rush. | Runaway, Devil in a New Dress (its 5 minutes and 52 seconds fuck off), Saint Pablo, Ill Mind of Hopsin 8 | Sing About Me/I'm Dying of Thirst.

I vividly remember when that album came out and I loved it, but was intimidated by such a long song. I had a wake and bake and jumped in the shower, the song came on I said I'll turn it off when I lost interest. I literally stood there captivated for 12 minutes as I experienced the song for the first time. | Los Angeles-The Midnight | Deadmau5 - Strobe | Thunderstorm by Matthew Sweet | Like half the songs on Zeppelin 1 (but every song on that album is unskippable and FUCK YOU if you disagree) | Escape is at Hand for the Travelin‚Äô Man by The Tragically Hip | Pyramids - Frank Ocean | No Quarter - Led Zeppelin | All Too well (10 Minute version) | Strobe - Deadmau5 | okay this might be weird but the really long 8 minute version of I will possess your heart by death cab for cutie | The Odyssey by Symphony X. | O'Malleys Bar

Bill Withers) | How does it feel (untitled) by D‚ÄôAngelo. | Nina Simone - Sinnerman | My brother the Dragonslayer | I want to throw in a word for the finales of some of Gilbert and Sullivan's operas here.  The finale of act 2 of 'Princess Ida', the finale of act 1 of 'Patience', the finale of act 1 of 'The Pirates of Penzance' all spring to mind.  They're made up of shorter pieces of song, usually group numbers, which are all furthering the plot before the final act, so added up they go over 6 minutes, but individually are short.  The music of 'Princess Ida' in particular is underrated because the plot is quite archaic, and the show itself 3 acts long instead of the usual 2, but the finale of act 2 contains some of the opera's finest tunes.  And 'Patience' deserves a lot more praise as well, with the only solo for the tenor being in the finale of act 1. | Pigs (Three Different Ones) - Pink Floyd (Animals Album) | Perfect Circle/God Speed - Mac Miller | Adore by Prince | A Change of Seasons | 11:59 - the exploding boy | Kiss land by The Weeknd | Sweet Home Chicago - Blues Brothers | Bury the light | Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, Ashkenazy's version | euphoria by kendrick lamar.

Amazing instrumental song that might be from a video game? If it is or not, it's atmospheric, melancholy, and generally great for when you just need something in the background while focusing

This is the 3rd part of a much larger song as well.   It was split into 3 tracks for the album but is one long song.  It goes for about 19 minutes all up, without a dead/uninteresting moment the entire time.  They're not jam songs or super repetitive either (like most longer songs). | Forever - The Charlatans | Herald of Darkness - Old God's of Asgard | Daedalus by Thrice is one of the best songs ever written. | Cult of Luna & Julie Christmas - Cygnus.

It‚Äôs about 15mins.  Hell, even if we just took the last 7mins alone, it‚Äôd still be my answer. | pyramids by frank ocean | To me this local song is just perfect: Phoenix - Invoca»õie. Beware: it‚Äôs experimental progressive rock of the 70s. | Turn off the lights I‚Äôm watching back to the future pt2 | Dogs by Pink Floyd, just a tad bit over 16 minutes.

Long can be like 20-30 mins composition full of energy. | Funny things by RecD, Micheal Kovach and Lizzie Freeman | pay the man

But ""Take me back to Eden"" by Sleep Token is a fantastic song if you like rock | Strobe deadmau5 | I Appear Missing by QOTSA | Glitter in the Gutter by A Hori Buzz | Shine on you crazy diamond | Dance with the devil. | Leave by R.E.M. | Sympathy for the Devil, the full version of Jesus of Suburbia (considering how seminal that album was for me), just falls short on time (5:35) but but A Day in The Life by the Beatles.

- Free Bird by Lynyrd Skynyrd

Oh love songs? Thought you meant songs I love | Hold On by The Internet‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs such a sensual, soothing song |  The Clandestine Gate by Bell Witch | How to Disappear Completely by Radiohead

An Ocean Between the Waves - The War on Drugs.

Starless - King Crimson. | All Too Well (Taylor‚Äôs Version) 10 minute. You‚Äôre immersed and swirled into her poetry, it‚Äôs heartbreakingly beautiful. | Orion by Metallica | I Would Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That) by Meatloaf.

Erykah Badu - Green Eyes | Stairway to Heaven | With full knowledge that this may not be popular, ‚ÄúRunaway‚Äù by Kanye West. It is a masterpiece of audio production.

I have ADHD and make sure a song is less than 3 min before I save it to my library. Also, I tend to have songs stuck in my head and will play on repeat üîÇ up until I‚Äôm utterly tired of it until I move on to next song. My saved song length average is no longer than 3 min. | Alter Bridge - Fable of the Silent Son, Cry of Achilles, and Blackbird 

Metallica - One, ... And Justice For All, and Unforgiven 3 

Between the Buried and Me - Turn on the Darkness | Tobacco Road - Edgar Winter, Johnny Winter, Rick Derringer 17 minutes of awesome live performance 
Opens ones eyes/ears to Blues-Rock | Avenged Sevenfold - A Little Piece Of Heaven | Chameleon- Headhunters | Disintegration (and at least two other songs off the album of the same name) by the Cure

Then She Did (and probably Three Days) by Jane‚Äôs Addiction

And of the four songs from Side B of Dylan‚Äôs ‚ÄúBringing it All Back Home,‚Äù but especially ‚ÄúGates of Eden‚Äù

Visions of Johanna and Desolation Row, while we‚Äôre at it

The Great Curve by Talking Heads (Born Under Punches isn‚Äôt quite long enough)

Shine on You Crazy Diamond and anything with a one-word animal name by Pink Floyd (but Echoes wastes some of its runtime)

I Could Never Take The Place of Your Man, by Prince

Most of the songs on ‚ÄúThe Future‚Äù by Leonard Cohen, as well as First We Take Manhattan. I‚Äôll cheat a little and add a second to ‚ÄúTake This Waltz‚Äù

They stopped letting me pick songs on the jukebox | Halo On Fire by Metallica | Closer by Nine Inch Nails, it's wild to me that song was made in 1994, it seems so ahead of it's time but I wasn't even outta the balls yet so what do I know ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I really like how it always feels like it's moving forward, it doesn't dwell on any particular sound. Like you know extended mixes of club songs where they'll just have a dry drum loop and an airy synth looping for far too many bars, while you're waiting for the actual song to start 2 minutes in.

He's always changing or adding to the melodies/noise, allowing it to progress. Everything takes like exact amount of time it should and I love it for that. And haha funny fuck word | Holding Out for a Hero - Bonnie Tyler

I know it's just shy of 6mins but if you need an honorable mention.. | [This](https://youtu.be/71Gt46aX9Z4?si=aBJ4Noz4bAn84qMw) Enjoy!üòä NOW GO TO Sleep | Octavarium - Dream Theater | The medley on Red Rose Speedway by Paul McCartney/Wings | 7empest | Save Me by Avenged Sevenfold | Save me - Avenged Sevenfold

Money for Nothing by Dire Straits (ft Sting)

Kiss Land by The Weeknd

The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald by Gordon Lightfoot

Constellation Cradle by Vylet Pony | Hallogallo by Neu! | Bohemian rhapsody | Dear God by Avenged Sevenfold is a good one. Soothsayer (Dedication To Aunt Suzie) by Buckethead is a beautiful instrumental. Sing About Me, I‚Äôm Dying Of Thirst by Kendrick Lamar is an artistic masterpiece. And last but not least, American Pie by Don McLean is one of my absolute favorites | Probably not suited to most people here but almost every song of Fela Kuti, but especially: [Upside Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVfmU_tGGqY) , [Lady](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQSvb86a5cY) and [Shakara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvYxd35xFx8) | Under pressure - logic | Get away by ocean colour scene | Anything by TOOL | Free Bird | Euphoria - Kendrick Lamar | Rutti by slow dive | Heaven and Hell - Black Sabbath | The Mars Volta - Cassandra Gemini

(or a bunch of other long ones, all good) | The Live Versions of Take What You Want by ONE OK ROCK. | Rap god by Eminem | Kate Bush Hello Earth. One of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard | Most of the Tool songs. | Triple Dog Dare by Lucy Dacus | Nothing Is Something Worth Doing- Shpongle | Eternity's Breath Pt 1 & 2 - Mahavishnu Orchestra | Avenged Sevenfold - Blinded In Chains. | November Rain | Dream within a dream by Propaganda. | I Will Possess Your Heart by Death Cab | ""Three Days"" - Jane's Addiction | Song of the Highest Tower by Cut Worms. | Shine on you crazy diamond | ""Stairway to Heaven"" by Led Zeppelin is a classic that makes every minute count. Its blend of guitar solos, epic build-up, and powerful lyrics never gets old. | Shogun - Trivium | [mewithoutYou - Rainbow Signs](https://youtu.be/YR542DzB_yc?si=wogdGwGYTAGqE292) | Foreplay/Long Time - Boston | Dopesmoker , it‚Äôs a masterpiece of its genre | In the Court of the Crimson King | Prisoner 1 and 2- Lupe Fiasco

Pyramids- Frank Ocean 

Marathon- Heartless Bastards 

Stairway to Heaven - Led Zepplin

Edit: do music pieces like Vivaldi or Blue Danube count? Cuz then I have a whole other list for you | Pigs (Three Different Ones) or a few Grateful Dead songs actually slap hard like Ship of Fools imo is amazing | Rosetta Stoned - Tool
I, The Witchfinder - Eletric Wizard 
Dogs - Pink Floyd | The Acacia Strain - Tactical Nuke | Pyramids- frank ocean | Blackrose Immortal -Opeth | Knights of Cydonia by Muse | Iron Lung - King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard | The Truth Beneath the Rose by Within Temptation | Chopin Nocturne op. 48 no. 1 | Paradise by the dashboard light | This one might be a long shot, but I have to go with Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Iron Maiden, a great musical retelling of the poem of the same name. | Torrid Soul by HVOB. Headphones and dark room necessary! | Money Trees -Kendrick Lamar | Song for zula - phosphorescent | Squid-Narrator | Visions by Haken | Meatloaf: I would do anything for love | The Stooges - Ann (full version from repetition). It is quite a power!
If you like Russian rock music, I can advice The Civil Defence - Russian Field of Experiments. Listen with translating titles, lyrics have a lot of references and really make sence.
As for classic music, I prefer Symphony number nine of Antonin Dvorak | American Pie | Funkadelic- Maggot Brain

Metallica - Fade To Black

Mac Miller - Turkey Love | The Count of Tuscany - Dream Theater. That song gives me chills every time. | Periphery - Reptile. 16 minutes. | The eve of war by Jeff Wayne. 
I prefer the version with Liam Neeson | Where the hell are all the grateful dead recommendations?  New minglewood, Touch of grey, Hell in a bucket, althea... granted the length can vary wildly depending on when and how the versions were played but if you want long masterpieces they were the kings in my mind | To see more light by Colin Stetson | Mike Oldfield - Tubular Bells | Telegraph Road - Dire Straits | Jesus of suburbia and opus | The End by The Doors | In the garden of eden , iron butterfly | Sign of the times - Harry Styles, comes to my mind | Runaway - Kanye West | Feel So Good - Chuck Mangione | The Decline - NOFX | Demolition Lovers- My Chemical Romance | Bury the light | Atom heart mother by Pink Floyd | Dreams Sweet in Sea Major | you never know - immortal technique | Creeping Death | Tide of Tears by The Parlor Mob | Freebird - Lynyrd Skynyrd | Meatloaf: Paradise by the Dashboard Light. Rockin‚Äô and hilarious üòÇ | Can't hear me knocking - Rolling Stones | Lover man by Metallica | Free bird | Blame Game Kanye (7:49) | Pink Floyd‚Äôs Shine On You Crazy Diamond‚Äîevery second feels like a journey through sound and emotion. | Sowing The Seeds Of Love - Tears For Fears | MacArthur Park - 7 minutes 21 seconds of indecipherable madness, kitchen sink production and more overblown than 1989's Duran Duran on tour. Majestic. | Moonlight Sonata | The Smoke of Many Fires by Be'lakor | ÿßŸÜÿß ŸàŸÑŸäŸÑŸâ | All 4 songs in the album *Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven* by *Godspeed You! Black Emperor*

They're so long (20 mins each) | Is this the real life. | Blinded by the Light | The Decline by NoFx is 18:19 of damn good punk rock music and really poignant lyrics. | November Rain, by Guns ‚Äòn‚Äô Roses. | Keeper of the Seven Keys - Helloween

By Kendrick Lamar | Exodus by Bob Marley and the Wailers. 


The first time I ever heard this song I had literal goose pimples.    There was a lot going on in England at the time and the song represented so much to so many people.    There was a Back to Africa movement that applauded it for obvious reasons , but there was another section that didn‚Äôt take the song quite so literally.   They saw it as a call to return to some form of divine intervention to get things to improve.  

I remember having long conversations with both groups of people of all colors and religions and each had a similar chill when they heard this song as well.   The song and the album spoke to so many people on so many different levels. | Heaven - by Ato ft. Eden | Maggot Brain | Axel Rudi Pell Mystica | Bat Out of Hell by Meat Loaf | November Rain GNR | November Rain - GnR | American Pie by Don McLean and Jesus of Suburbia by Green day¬† | Symphony for the Devil | Jacob‚Äôs ladder by rush | Bohemian Rhapsody | Paradise by the Dash Board Light- Meatloaf

Money for Nothing

Runaway- Kanye West | Newborn - Muse | Sixteen - Rick Ross. Andre 3000‚Äôs verse is amazing | Frankenstein- Edgar Winter Group |   Fila Funk by Fila Brazilia (17mins) | Bohemian Rhapsody and Bat out of Hell

Also the Rock and Roll hall of fame for George Harrison version of While my Guitar gently weeps | Third Eye - Tool

tbh most Tool songs | Innagaddavida. | Under the pressure by the war on drugs | Peace Piece by Bill Evans | Sandrevan Lullaby by Rodriguez | Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen | Rapper's Delight | Out Of My Mind - John Mayer Trio. Even better if you can watch him play. | Dark Star by the Grateful Dead. It's awesome to play on a jukebox when nobody is playing any music. After 18 minutes, people are clamoring to play anything else. It also doesn't hurt that I like the Dead. | ###Free bird - Lynyrd Skynyrd
And also
###Hurricane - Bob Dylan | King for a day - Faith No More | Neverland by Infected Mushroom | TOOL. pretty much any of them, but i've been in love with this one    [Danny Carey | ""Pneuma"" by Tool (LIVE IN CONCERT) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FssULNGSZIA) | The Past Is a Grotesque Animal - Of Montreal | Telegraph Road - Dire Straits. | ‚ÄúStaying alive‚Äù by Cursive | Dicks automotive by the Rugburns | Wish you had made the criteria 05:55 so that I could have included the most successful long song of all time:  Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen. | Bohemian Rhapsody | Yes

Heart of the Sunrise | Alot by 21 Savage (YouTube version) | Telegraph Road by Dire Straits is an experience | Dream Teather - The Best of Times (13.07)
Dream Teather - The Count of Tuscany (19.17)
Dream Teather - The Spirit Carries On (6.38)

To be fair, everything they did is amazing. | Anniversary- Tony! Toni! Tone! | Bohemian Rhapsody | Weight of Love by The Black Keys | Still got the blues - Gary Moore....
That is just epicness | Nightwish - Greatest Show on Earth. At least i think that‚Äôs the one, they have a couple of longer ones | Awakening - Unleash the Archers | The Private Psychedelic Reel or The Sunshine Underground by The Chemical Brothers.

Best experienced while driving on a curvy or hilly road. Going West from Flagstaff Az is a good drice for them. | ‚ÄúAnd as we wind on down the road‚Ä¶‚Äù | Alice's Restaurant | Tarkus by ELP | Touch - Daft Punk | Neptune by foals | Australian Dream by The Pretty Littles | War Pigs by Black Sabbath, Lover You Should‚Äôve Come Over by Jeff Buckley | Hold On - The Internet

Feels like I'm floating wherever I listen to it üòá | Faroeste Caboclo by Legi√£o Urbana | Meatloaf | Blackstar by David Bowie. It changes you after a while. | Can‚Äôt believe I haven‚Äôt seen any Sleep Token.

Ascensionism and Take Me Back to Eden. easy | Echoes - pink floyd
Shine on you crazy diamond - pink floyd
Wet sand - RHCP | The decline - NoFX | Any electronic / ambient works by Aphex Twin or Nine Inch Nails. | Purple Rain-Prince!   (I think it‚Äôs 6 min) | Year of the Cat by Al Stewart (6:40 album version).  Never get tired of it. | Telegraph Road - Dire Straits | anything by type o | Hotel California | Mirrors - Justin Timberlake 
Pyramids - Frank ocean | Gravity (Live) by John Mayer | Strobe by deadmau5 | Aunt Suzie- Buckethead

So good | goodbye - sewerslvt | jesus of suburbia by Green Day <3 | Awaken by yes, one of the most angelic yes songs ever, the church organ is beautiful, Jon's singing is beautiful, what more can I say, the majority of Yes's discography is AWESOMEEE | Metallica's cover of Tuesday's Gone | Bohemian Rhapsody!! | Its Not The Same Anymore - Rex Orange County

stg this song helped me crawl out of my deepest depression | Rime of the ancient mariner - Iron Maiden Powerslave 13:28 | Master of Puppets | **Echoes by Pink Floyd** has some of the best guitar work in the history of rock music.

It's widely considered revolutionary in the development of the sub-genre of Progressive Rock. | Cry of Achilles- Altar bridge. Only over by 31 seconds but worth every bit. | Innerbloom - rufus du sol | Knights of Shame by Awolnation | Teeth Like God's Shoeshine by Modest Mouse (or any 6+ minute Modest Mouse song for that matter) | My Head Is A Jungle | Sultans of Swing by Dire Straits. That guitar solo at the end is FIRE | 6 Degrees of Inner Turbulence - Dream Theater. I think it's 42 minutes long | Le nozze di Figaro | They‚Äôre called Tool. | Not quite 6 minutes (5.45) but Isle of Flightless Birds by top. All time favourite | Prologue/crunchy Granola sweet. Neil Diamond. | Legion by TesseracT.  
  
Such impressive vocals front to back and you can hear the raw emotion in Daniel Tompkins' voice. This song has got range. They're a Prog Metal band with a Djenty sound. So if that's not your thing then it might not be for you. Legion sits just under 6mins but was my most listened to song in 2023 and probably will be again in 2024.  
  
If you like this song you should watch this awesome reaction/Vocal breakdown video I just found a few weeks ago that gave me a new appreciation for this song. If you're not super into reaction videos, this one is unique in that he actually has Daniel Tompkins on to talk about his vocal parts throughout the reaction and talks about the vocal parts with great detail throughout. You can tell the guy reacting really knows a lot about singing. Worth the watch in my opinion once you've given it a full listen for yourself first.

It‚Äôs an 8 minutes song with a long instrumental section, featured in Your Name (not my favourite movie unfortunately) for the climax | Sinnerman by Nina Simone | https://youtu.be/P8f-Qb-bwlU?si=a2A5df9zYsBf5HfQ | Ren - Hi Ren. A masterpiece | Jesus of Suburbia | Euphoria - Kendrick Lamar | Metallica - Orion | War Pigs. Supposedly it's almost 8 minutes long, but you could have fooled me. | The End - The Doors | Telegraph Road by Dire Straits | Decree of the Prosecutor from Turnabout: An Ace Attorney Musical. | Steroids. | Shogun - Trivium | Lots of great ones already listed so I‚Äôll add this one: Perfect World by Broken Bells. Song captures me from the beginning and it‚Äôs still one of my favorite songs ever. | I remember - deadmau5 | Atom heart mother. | America by Yes | Jesus of Suburbia | Let It Happen -Tame Impala | Telegraph Road - Dire Straits. | Free Bird by Lynyrd Skynyrd | - Lady With A Fan, by the Grateful Dead

I‚Äôve seen them live 3 times and not once have I seen this song. Bums me out every time | You Wish by Unida. Lovely ending guitar solo! | Strobe - deadmau5 | Deadmau5 - Strobe | Sleep Token The Summoning 6:34 | Dylan's "" Like a Rolling Stone"" is a perfect 6:00 in length for this criteria | Riders on the storm-the doors | MacArthur Park ;) | Do you feel like I do by Peter Frampton | Trapped in the Closet and it‚Äôs Parody, trapped in the Drivethrough.

Also, Albuquerque by weird Al. | The count of Tuscany by dream theater - it is IMMENSE | Stuck inside of mobile with the Memphis blues again | Flight of the Icarus by Iron Maiden.

https://youtu.be/2cZ_EFAmj08 | Hotel California -The Eagles | Desolation Row | American Pie, Don McLean. I‚Äôll never get tired of that song. | 2dabeat by Super Flu. Such a great techno track. Simple hypnotic beats introduced one at time, gradually adding more layers and filling out the sound, it all comes together and absolutely bops. One of my favorites. | Led Zeppelin, Dazed and Confused | Octavarium by Dream Theater. | I would do anything for love by meatloaf | In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3 by Coheed and Cambria | Free bird by Lynyrd Skynyrd.  13:44 | Strobe by Deadmaus! | A Little Piece of Heaven--Avenged Sevenfold | Dream a highway - Gillian Welch | The Mars Volta - Frances the Mute. Really, the entire Album is one long song. If that doesn't count, then the titular single that did not make it onto the Album (I will never forgive them for that). | Let it happen - Tame Impala | Lyfjaberg by Wardruna. Even if you can't understand the language (like me) it's still a gorgeous song. | Nothing Else Matters - that Guitar Solo is getting in your ear and will never leave you | Thick as a Brick | Almost all of Tool's back catalogue.

But Invincible especially just gets better every time. | In-a-gadda-da-diva | Lazy by Deep Purple.

It's groovy, it's very 70s, and it's a master-class in call and response. Listen to it with good headphones or a set of stereo speakers. Each instrument takes turns finishing each other's sentences, is one way to put it. | I love Rivers of Belief by Enigma | Purple rain 

Pink Floyd @ Pompei | The Odyssey by Symphony X. The song is a whole story with multiple different kind of sections and themes within the song, a great journey like the name suggests! | One by Metallica is My fav | The Battle of Hampton Roads - Titus Andronicus 

This song is the song I sing when I‚Äôm stressed out. It‚Äôs long, tells a great story and has a bagpipe solo. | It's not long enough but Weird Al The Saga Begins is phenomenal. | I‚Äôm biased but most Dream Theatre songs, Panic Attack for example | Liberation- Outkast | ‚ÄúSky Pilot‚Äù by The Animals | Moon by Kid Francescolli, when I hear it I instantly have flashes of my life and I get very nostalgic about my life. I want to listen to it in my last moments, I think it would be very reflective and peaceful end. | Arziyan from Delhi 6 | The Dark Eternal Night by Dream Theater | [Saryglarlar by Huun Huur Tu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSEXGNJs5o0) (8:18 long)

It's like giving your tired soul a massage. | in a gadda da vida by iron butterfly | Tool - Pneuma | Defiler by Stromae | Champagne Supernova - Oasis | That feels like a long list. Here are some of mine: 
Schism by elephant revival 
Stairway to heaven 
One by Metallica 
Master of puppets by Metallica | Does ""The Long One"" (Abbey Road B side) count? | Arkona-–ù–∞ –º–æ–µ–π –∑–µ–º–ª–µ (Na moey Zemle)-In my land
A song featuring six different vocalists from six different bands on the 2009 album ‚ÄúGoi, rode, goi !‚Äù A folk metal masterpiece.

Galdur-Lord of iron fortress, fron the 2016 album ‚ÄúAge of legends‚Äù epic dungeon synth.

Don McLean-American pie, another masterpiece of nostalgy and flame of youth.

Black sabbath-Heaven and Hell, when you talk about metal masterpiece, this one comes automatically

And there are so much more‚Ä¶ | The 7 out of 9 songs on Metallica's ""And Justice For All"". The other 2 are 5:45 and 5:13 so they too are longer than most songs. 

Other songs that make the cut: 

Orbital - The Box (Part 1)

Orbital - The Box (Part 2) | hospital for souls by Bring Me The Horizon | Freebird | Bohemian Rhapsody is an obvious one 

Jesus of Suburbia is a personal favorite

In keeping secrets of silent earth 3, you'll either love it or hate it | Free Bird | Born slippy | ATW10MVTVFTV | Let me type over five hundred heavy metal songs. | Matters of the Heart by Tracy Chapman. | Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding. | Herald of Darkness by the Old Gods of Asgard. Also available in 3, 9, 13, and 30 minutes | You want it darker (Solomon remix) | Ocean by John Butler

One of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. | 21st Century Schizoid Man by King Crimson | American Pie - Don McLean | All Nightmare Long by Metallica.

Bonus points for the music video being a decent zombie outbreak movie | Since I haven‚Äôt seen it for some mystifying reason, [21st Century Schizoid Man by King Crimson](https://youtu.be/7OvW8Z7kiws?si=pNqkPi1KCIp46Fzz) is a fuckin‚Äô *journey*. There‚Äôs like four different stages of this song, and they‚Äôre all badass. | In Your Room - Airiel | Ender - Finch | Free Bird, Innuendo.. | Overture by John Miles | Harrison‚Äôs Dream by Pater Graham. | Tool - The Pot | One, To Live is To Die and Suicide & Redemption, all by Metallica. | Bohemian Rhapsody being 5:55 is like a cruel joke on your part. | any Tool songs | In A Gadda Da Vida - album version | Strobe - deadmau5 | Every single Wintersun song :) | IRON BUTTERFLY  In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida | Insatiable - PRINCE | I like lots... but one I doubt I'll see listed here is Eurotrash Girl by Cracker. | Because I haven‚Äôt seen it and it doesn‚Äôt get the respect I think it deserves‚Ä¶. 

Blackbird - Alter Bridge 

Maybe one of my favorite songs lyrically, vocally, and musically in one 8 minute box. Criminally underrated and unknown. | Freebird by Lynard Skynard. That solo is killer! | Bohemian Rhapsody | Plenty to choose from, but let's go with:

Avantasia - Let the storm descend upon you | Champagne Supernova by Oasis | Caught Somewhere in Time by Iron Maiden | Fury of the Storm by Dragonforce | dire straits - sultans of swing alchemy live ver, just 10 mins of pure magic | Freebird, Can't you see, Great White Buffalo, Hibernation | Homecoming -Green Day | Hotel California | Blackbird by Alter Bridge | Transcendance - Santana. | A little piece of heaven by Avenged Sevenfold. 

It‚Äôs a bit of a ride | Space Truckin' (Made in Japan version), Deep Purple, almost 20 minutes of puro psychedelic prog rock gold | Permament holiday | Money for nothing - Dire Straits | Money for Nothing. | The World is a Ghetto by WAR | Mirror Reaper - Bell Witch | How has no one said through the fire and flames yet? | Gnr. Estranged. | Sheep by Pink Floyd. Amazing. | Money For Nothing - Dire Straits

Has to be the full version. Intro full volume. | Reflection, Tool | Children - Dream version, Robert Miles | Dogs - Pink Floyd | The only one remember is ""Light my fire"" - The Doors
Not a big fan, but it's the only few 6min+ I bear lol | The Ring of the Nibelung | Spinning in Daffodils - Them Crooked Vultures | The Odyssey by Symphony X. 24 minutes of pure art. | Alice's restaurant | In Da Gadda Da Vida by Iron Butterfly | Invincible, by Tool. | Nothing else matters or fade to black | Why is Bohemian Rhapsody not the Number 1 comment here?
Also Free Bird at close second. | Inamorata by Metallica 

I personally feel like most of their newer music is‚Ä¶ uninspired or bland might be the best way to describe it; most of it sounds the same. Inamorata is their longest song they‚Äôve released, and it‚Äôs on their newest album. I didn‚Äôt even realize it was over 11 minutes (11:10) the first few times I listened to it. Probably their best, or at least top 3, song this millennium. | Can someone make me a playlist of all these songs? | I would do anything for love - Meat Loaf | Suite madame blue by Styx | Freebird | Deep purple - Child in time

Love it. | Alice‚Äôs restaurant massacre by Arlo Guthrie Is worth all 18 minutes | From autumn to ashes - short stories with tragic endings | Starla smashing pumpkins | From The Edge Of The Deep Green Sea by The Cure | Hallelujah - Jeff Buckley | May I suggest ‚ÄòMountain‚Äô and their track ‚ÄòNantucket Sleigh-ride‚Äô. 13 minutes of guitar greatness!! | Lynyrd Skynyrd -Free Bird | [Gethsamane](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=O1ley5TlJCE) from Jesu Christ Superstar. There‚Äôre many versions performed by many singers, but I particularly like Drew Sarich‚Äôs performance, of which there are many versions as well. | Bohemian Rhapsody duh | Soothsayer by Buckethead | Bohemian Rhapsody | Warning by Black Sabbath | Invincible by Tool | One - Metallica | Most tool songs. I will fight anyone on this lmao | Any song by TOOLüòå | The Voyage by Timeless Miracle. | The Summoning - Sleep Token | strobe by deadmau5 | **Heart**'s live version of *Stairway To Heaven* is a must listen.

Bonus points - they played it live in front of Led Zeppelin who were getting awarded for their contributions to music. | Siberian Breaks, MGMT | ‚ÄúThe Private Psychedelic Reel‚Äù by The Chemical Brothers | ‚ÄúMaggot Brain‚Äù by Funkadelic. 

3 of the 4 songs on Todd Rundgren‚Äôs ‚ÄúUtopia‚Äù. 

‚ÄúEchoes‚Äù by Pink Floyd. | Master of Puppets | ""Jesus of Suburbia"" Green Day | Alice‚Äôs restaurant | Daft Punk - Too Long

  
Still too short to my taste :) | Metallica - One | Bob Dylan‚Äôs Tangled up in Blue | Patti Smith Land: Horses/Land of a Thousand Dances | Lost Cause (Full Session Unreleased) - Juice Wrld | ‚ÄúPictures of You‚Äù - The Cure | Euphoria | Dream Theater - Panic Attack | Jesus of Suburbia. 

Legendary piece of songwriting and performance. | Pretty much anything from r/toolband | Purple Rain by Prince, Voodoo Chile by Jimi Hendrix, Stairways to Heaven by Led Zeppelin, Free Bird by Lynyrd Skynyrd and 1983 by Hendrix | Out of My Mind - Live by John Mayer. Before hearing this performance I thought of John as just some other radio pop artist with sex appeal & a guitar. But the performance in this song showed me just how great of a guitarist/blues appreciation-er he is.

What's it about, you ask? Only a refugee escaping from an advanced race of aliens (led by President X-D) and coming to Earth to warn humanity. It doesn't have a good ending. | as a prog rock and metal head, i could list half of my spotify playlists right now | Bohemian Rhapsody | Insomnia original versin | The greatest show on earth by nightwish. 21 minutes pure gold | Alice‚Äôs Restaurant | La Villa Strangiato - Rush | Every time I put Rock Lobster by the B-52‚Äôs on in a crowded sports bar has been totally worth it. | Beach Life and Death | ""Aja"" by Steely Dan and ""Through the Fire and the Flames"" and ""Soldiers of the Wasteland"" by DragonForce | Konstantine.

Just over 10 minutes long | Oingo Boingo - Deadman's party | Paschendale by Iron Maiden.

One by Metallica.

Full Metal Jackoff by Jello Biafra | In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida by Iron Butterfly. Takes up an entire B side and has a 5 plus minute drum solo. Every second of that song either makes me feel happy or groovy. | Achilles come down - Gang of youths

This is Hardcore - Pulp | Bohemian Rhapsody | There are so many great ones but Strobe by deadmau5 and Pneuma by Tool are great. | Heron Blue | Pneuma  by Tool | [Don McLean American Pie](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Pie_(Lied)) | Rappers Delight | Take me Back to Eden or The Summoning by Sleep Token, these songs give me an out of body experience | Led Zeppelin - Kashmir | I know how to speak by Manchester Orchestra | One Sunday Morning by Wilco is a masterpiece of song building. 12 minutes of one riff and it just flies by. | Exist-Avenged sevenfold | Telegraph Road - Dire Straits. | Every Car Seat Headrest song | Nothing Else Matters - Metallica. | Total Eclipse of the Heart | [Ayreon - The Day That The World Breaks Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFuMKdrzPqU) is the opener from The Source album and basicly give you everything you need to expact from it with all Vocalists present without loosing he stile so its coherent to the end even with all the interlude's. | Vektor - Recharging the Void
It's metal, then for a while it's mellow and beatiful, then the most epic you'll ever hear. One of the very few songs that literally gave me chills | Slightly cheating, but the entire Abbey Road medley is amazing. | NOFX - The Decline

  
18 minutes of pure punkrock bliss | Eminem - Rap God

Not alot of hiphop comments, so here's one. 6:03 | November Rain - Guns'n'Roses | To Many Cooks in the Kitchen. | Burry the light and devil trigger | Marbles by the amazing devil | Wings for Marie Pt. 2 by Tool | Year of the Cat - Al Stewart | Jungleland | Unless, of course, somebody comes up with 5-Minute songs. Then you‚Äôre in trouble, huh? | ""Westbrook on a farm"" by lil Dicky


One of those songs where he tells a story. Less jokey but real good to listen to | I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God,.

I'm still a bit annoyed that Harry Shotta literally just wrote some mealy-mouthed quick talking nonsense to beat it's WPM when there was actual flow to Eminem's song. | Tool (all of it) | Hotel California, if it comes on the Radio or any other device, I have to listen to all of it | One - Metallica | American pie by Don Mc Lean | The three central songs on Pink Floyd's ""Animals"" album.

[Dogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QA30qkRYy8), [Pigs(Three different ones)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZM1WQKwpl0), and [Sheep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GE-sfEbJ7I); all 10+ minutes and are, taken each on their own or as a trio, masterpieces. The whole concept album is a little over 40 minutes long and should be essential listening for any music lover. | Bending hectic the smile | Something by Tool | Mural - Lupe Fiasco.

More than 8 mins of conscious rap with complex lyrical structure. Just genius | All Too Well 10m version ü•π | Konstantine | Mural by Lupe Fiasco | P.S.Y. by the Butthole Surfers. If you know, you know. | Jesus of Suburbia | The weekend- party and the after party | Shogun by trivium | American pie, Don McLean

That was nice of the most iconic songs of early rap!

https://youtu.be/rKTUAESacQM | Maggot Brain by Funkadelic | What about a 22 minute song? 

Visions by Haken, if you like prog metal/rock at all, you won't regret it | Chanson Noir by Harmonium¬† | Stairway to Heaven | Ghost Love Score by Nightwish 

It was the song that got me into metal, before that I mostly listened to techno/trance and was only ""wetting my feet"" with safe already-mainstream heavy metal or hard rock songs (Metallica, AC/DC) | Touch by Daft Punk | Little pi√®ce of heavenz | all to well 10 min ver - Taylor Swift or venice beach - Lana Del Rey | ITIIITIATIIHYLIHYL by BLACKSHAPE | Frank Ocean- Pyramids | ‚ÄúHi Ren‚Äù by Ren it‚Äôs around 9 minutes‚Ä¶. Fucking phenomenal artist and such a beautifully written song. The video is out of this world as well. I‚Äôm surprised as heck i don‚Äôt see it on here already. | Jesus of suburbia or runaway | Ocean -jbt | Tum Ek Gorakhdhanda Ho
Song by Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan - 30 mins

One of the most amazing pieces of songs, in the qawali genre!! | Disintegration - The Cure

A Forest is 5:55 but just add five seconds and sit in marvelled reflection. | One More Hour - Tame Impala 

7 minutes and I personally find zero points in the song where I‚Äôm knocked out of its immersion. | The A Side of Thick as a Brick by Jethro Tull. | Chinacat sunflower by the Greatful dead | Lesley- Dave, brilliant song and brilliant story explaining the life of a victim of abuse and a crappy boyfriend | In-a-Gadda-Da-Vida by Iron Butterfly

(Not Just) Knee Deep by George Clinton and Funkadelic | Anything by Godspeed You! Black Emperor | Herald of Darkness (Complete Edit). | Being a Punk fan myself, The Decline by NoFX, 18 minutes, no verses get repeated, and by the end of it you feel like you heard a few different songs.
There's also an orchestral version on YouTube, not bad. | I Walk Alone - Marijata

If you like reggae, funk, soul or garage rock you will probably like this song, it's the one song I wish I could go back and listen to for the first time again the most. My only complaint is I wish it was longer. Headphones or decent speakers are recommended.

https://youtu.be/KVfEEdspAQE?si=tNtHLyEuLH0CoBHL

https://open.spotify.com/track/6sVm6ik1mXyXlDFexORZpQ?si=1q73-MnqTomYxbf7DmGMPA | Talk Talk's Eden. | Every Godspeed song, almost. 

Especially Sleep. | The prophet's song -Queen. | The Memo - Father John Misty. 5min but an excellent commentary on society | ‚ÄòComfortably Numb‚Äô hands down. 

Pink Floyd are legends. David Gilmour and Roger Waters, along with Richard Wright and Nick Mason made phenomenal music.  The solos in Comfortably Numb are GOAT status. | American pie | Aqueous Transmission - Incubus | Money for nothing - dire straits | Paradise by the Dashboard Lights | Stagger Lee by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, TB Sheets by Van Morrison and Bending Hectic by The Smile | Virtue, by Overwerk. | No vocals in any of my recommend but: 

Paradis by Wintergatan 

Soothsayer by Buckethead

End of the Beginning by Jason Becker | Free bird. The longer the better. | 3030 by Deltron 3030 | The Perfect Kiss (single or substance version) by New Order | Bat out of hell - Meatloaf also Paradise by the dashboard light and I would do anything for love (but I won‚Äôt do that). Basically most of meatloaf. | Pneuma - TOOL | Wax Wings - Periphery¬† | Early Lana del Rey songs were a little rough but good GOD, *Cruel World* is an incredible song. | Terrapin Station Medley by The Grateful Dead | Runaway - Kanye | Hi Ren | Bury the Light | Paprika Plains by Joni Mitchell | stoned jesus - i am the mountain

at the end of it you really believe him when he tells you that he is the mountain | Seven angles. | Reptile by Periphery. It‚Äôs pushing almost 16 minutes. But for modern metal, you really can‚Äôt get any better. | Lingus - Snarky Puppy | Rhapsody of Fire - Queen of the Dark Horizons | There Might Be Coffee - Deadmau5 | ‚ÄòDemonsword‚Äô by ‚Äòthe quarry‚Äô üëçüèª | The empyrean | Central by John frusicante | Iron Maiden. Rime of the ancient mariner. ü§ò | Octavarium By Dream Theater. | Child in a time | There and back again  
Heroes of mighty magic  
Both by Twilight Force | Definitely one by matellica | Oranssi pazuzu - vasemman k√§den hierarkia | Bohemian Rhapsody by far | Station to Station - David Bowie | Tool, their whole catalog, but Lateralus is the special one everyone should experience. At loud volume, with very good headphones... A joint helps too | Every Mars Volta song that‚Äôs over 6 minutes. | Terrapin Station by Grateful Dead | The Decline by NOFX. Best 17 minutes of punk rock history. | Mistreated by Deep Purple | Seasons in the Abyss - Slayer | Aja | Lateralus - Tool | The Lark Ascending - Ralph Vaughan Williams | Alex Hutton Trio - JJ. Goes through so many phases, so rich. Imho, the only song that depicts modern ‚Äúrat race‚Äù life. | coloratura by coldplay | Comfortably Numb | Ren - Hi Ren 9 minutes and 21 seconds of amazing. | To Be Loved - Adele | almost any Tool song but Lateralus is a stand out for me. State of Mind's Running Time is another of my personal favorites | ross capicchioni by Joyner Lucas | Paradise by the dashboard light | Ren - Hi Ren 

Its a masterpiece
I had this song on repeat for a year | Tool - Pneuma | Dire Straits - Telegraph Road. | Microphones in 2020 by the microphones (45 minutes) yes the eight minutes of two chords being strummed are entirely neccessary | Opus - Eric Prydz | Duk Koo Kim by Sun Kil Moon | Time Pink Floyd. | Shine on You crazy Diamond | All Too Well 10 Minute Version | Jesus of Suburbia - Green Day | ‚ÄúEvie‚Äù by Stevie Wright. (frontman of the Easybeats).
Written by Harry Vanda and George Young and released as a single in 1974. It has been suggested that it is the first 11-minute song to chart at #1 anywhere in the world. | D'you know what I mean and All around the world both by Oasis | Ommadawn by Mike Oldfield | The classic, Stairway to Heaven | Thinking of a place by The war on drugs | Ain't no one likely to give this the time but ""ST.PLAGUE"" by Grim Salvo off their recent album is very strong and I find myself wanting more of it when it ends. 

For a nearly 7 minute song, even with a use of repetition it changes sound and mood throughout it so well that I easily find myself engaged the entire listen. It's a perfect ending song for the album, which I recommend just listening through in order every time. | Shogun by Trivium | Untitled #3 - Sigur Ros. | Svefn-G-Englar with Sigur R√≥s | American pie | Almost anything by Telepath | Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence by Dream Theater. 42 minutes that are worth listening to. | Led zeppelin has a few but my favourite has to be ‚ÄúSince I‚Äôve Been Loving You‚Äù | Runaway by Kanye | Everytime I Look at You - Hall & Oates | rosetta stoned - tool (11:11) | Jethro Tull: ""Thick as a Brick.""

43:42, and every second (even the time it took to flip the disc in 1972) perfection. | Every 6+ minutes songs by Tool. | Telegraph road  dire straits | Dazed and Confused - Led Zeppelin | The Decline -NOFX | Busta rhymes- flipmode meets Def squad¬† | ‚ÄúAlbuquerque‚Äù or ‚ÄúTrapped in the Drive-Thru‚Äù by Weird Al Yankovic. Both songs are around 10 minutes and they both bring me such joy with each listen. | Pnuma - Tool | Estranged | A lot of Frank Zappa songs. | Mogwai ""Take Me Somewhere Nice"" | Bohemian Rhapsody
Day the Music Died | Jesus of Suburbia | Sleep Token - Take Me Back To Eden | Greatest Show on Earth - Nightwish | Ren - Hi Ren | Torn - Creed | Idk how many listen to M83 but Lower Your Eyelids to Die With the Sun is fantastic | Citizen Erased - Muse | MacArthur Park by Richard Harris. | DJ Screw - June 27th | 2112 - Rush | Anything by Mozart or Bach | Comfortably numb | Miasma by Ghost. Especially the live version. What other song has a Satanic Antipope rise from the dead just to play a saxophone solo with a backing band of demons summoned from hell, before he dies again?

Yeah. Exactly.

[Live version here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J7XhedAA2E)  The pope turns up at around the 3:45 mark. | Innuendo by Queen | ariana - tony anderson | City of Stars- Logic | Spottieotiedopalicious by
OutKast | Silver Mt Zion - Blind Blind Blind | ""A Change of Seasons"" by Dream Theater at 23 minutes. | Deadmau5 strobe | Matty Groves by Fairport Convention | Advent One Winged Angel from Final Fantasy VII Advent Children, literally one of the best renditions of OWA. Absolutely peak.

Darkness of the Unknown from Kingdom Hearts II, most notably the original (aka vanilla) version. Definitely one of the best final boss themes out there in video games. The original one I consider to be the best, the 2.5 Remix version isn‚Äôt too shabby, but the original is just truly something else. | Xanthochroid - Toward Truth and Reconciliation,

√Üther Realm - Craft and the Creator


These are my favorites | a quick one before the eternal worm devours connecticut | Tool - Schism

Tool - Vicarious | Mg≈Ça - Age of Excuse VI | Green grass and high tides - the outlaws.  By far my favorite long song, coming in at a wopping almost 10 min long. 0 filler, no crazy long intro or outro, beautiful guitar, good lyrics, rhythm shifts, and variety in sound, an absolute jam fest throught.  Captivating song that you can listen to the full song without getting bored but it feels like a long song cuz it's like 3 normal songs in length. | Most tool songs. But Pneuma is amazing. Watch the live drum video if you wana feel a rush | Innerbloom - Rufus Du Sol | David Bowie - Station to Station | The poet and the pendulum | Hotel California - Eagles | Breathless by Shankar Mahadevan | VOH | 10,000 days (Wings pt. 2) - TOOL | Weight of Love by the Black Keys | Nowhere Fast, by Fire Inc. 6:04, from the Streets of Fire movie, soundtrack and Diane Lane the only good things in that film. | In da gadda da vida | Pike 65 by Buckethead

30 minutes of pure instrumental. He wrote it for his mom that succumbed to her battle with cancer over several years.

The climax is about 23-26 minutes in and it's well worth the ride.

Dance Yourself Clean - LCD Soundsystem | Evie - by Steve Wright. ( 1974). 

It's been suggested that this was the first 11 min rock song to chart at #1 anywhere in the world and honestly it holds up really well in my opinion. 

Sometimes called Evie parts 1, 2 & 3, because it was released on vinyl, part 1 on a side , 2 & 3 on b side.

Holy shit what a wonderous song, so many interpretations.

I took it as the muddled thoughts of a dementia patient, who in the middle of the song has their moment of clarity when they remember who they are, who they were, before the song devolves back to their jumbled mind.

My partner took it as the thoughts of someone trying to desperately make sense of their own impending death, the odd, out of sync saxaphone at the end reminding her of cardiac arrythmia.

No matter how you look at it, an amazing song. | Human Sadness by Julian Casablancas+The Voidz (11m) is to me what Bohemian Rhapsody is to white people | Rapper's Delight. Gets me jamming & snapping & dancing, but it's a long-ass song. | [Ott - The Queen of All Everything](https://youtu.be/HnhuZ_p-dbQ?si=mWCbYl6FV50gCMLM)

Glorious. | And then there was silence - Blind Guardian | Ocean - John Butler | ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Long Way There ‚Äúby the Little River Band. The full length version.

I don't know if this counts as it's technically 3 songs but you wouldn't know if you didn't know | Idk bout y‚Äôall but the 12 minute ‚ÄúSing about me, I‚Äôm dying of thirst‚Äù (SAMIDOT) by Kendrick is for the lost part unskippable | *Again* by Archive. They have a short 4-minute version for radio. You can find versions with 9, 12, and 16 minutes. Since I listened to the full version, everything else feels rushed and short. | Doesn‚Äôt quite hit 6 minutes but ‚ÄúDeath of The Robot With Human Hair‚Äù by Dance Gavin Dance.  Damn I love that song. | A long song a little over 6 mins that‚Äôs worth it especially when you‚Äôre feeling groovy or would like to uplift your mood is ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Stop Til You Get Enough‚Äù by Michael Jackson :) | [Like A Rolling Stone](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/may/13/bobdylan?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other) | Guns n Roses Estranged. | Echoes - Pink Floyd | Aphex Twin - Windowlicker | Hey Jude | Jambi | Everybody‚Äôs free (to wear sunscreen) | Notorious Thugs | Age of Man and Age of Machine by Greta Van Fleet | Threnody - Two Gallants | Whipping Post | # Fish - Clich√© | The rain song-Zeppelin | Liyoshona by Kwiish SA | homecoming by green day. fucking love that song. | Halo by Machine Head | Supertramp Fools Overture

Honestly this popped up on my yt recommended one time and I teared up and had goosebumps. Beautiful song. The message, the symbolysm, the buildup, the climax. Just wow, actual 10/10 play this at my funeral.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PoPv0Gj9_o | I would say Storm by Godspeed, You! Black Emperor

No other song really makes me feel like it does and  every section builds on itself and swells into some of the greatest music ever produced by man (imho). And the ending taking what was so grand and making it desolate and haunting, there‚Äôs truly not much music out there that can make me feel so much through the power of just music alone, no vocals. Absolutely stunning song on a perfect album. | honestly runnaway by kanye is pretty good imo | Free bird by lynyrd skynyrd | Echoes | That was a crazy game of Poker, O.A.R | Rock Lobster | pretty much every song from Jeff Wayne's War Of The Worlds, even better when it's listened to in it's entirety and not as individual songs. | Desolation Row by Bob Dylan & Meet Me At The Creek by Billy Strings | Jesus of Suburbia -Green Day | It's like you specifically made a question for Bohemian Rhapsody. | 2112 | The whole Pink Floyd live in Pompei album

I believe like every song though, there is a shorter version. I‚Äôm not sure what is cut out though.

Doing the rap is so fun | Blackstar by Bowie. His last great hurrah. | Achilles Come Down by Gang of Youths! *Such* an underrated song, I love it. | Avenged Sevenfold - A Little Piece Of Heaven

This will get soooo many downvotes, but the song is awesome, especially for people who enjoy drums. | The Battle of Epping Forest - Genesis | Solway Firth - Slipknot | Battle of Hampton Roads | Periphery - Reptile | last call or mortal man | Free bird, easy | Blue Line Swinger by Yo La Tengo. The most cathartic sounds I‚Äôve even known. | Midnight Rambler by The Rolling Stones | I see most comments being pop or rock.

I'll be an outlier and say ""Embrace of the Endless Ocean""

It tells a epic story of a freed slave trying to get back home but as he sails, the storm hits his boat and he capsizes on a strange land.

The aggression behind the lyrics ""The endless ocean swallows me, this will be my cold wet tomb"" just expresses so much sorrow. | Maggot Brain Funkadelic 

Not Just Knee deep Funkadelic | Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen. Every second of that 6-minute masterpiece is iconic. From the operatic section to the killer guitar solo, it‚Äôs like multiple songs packed into one, and not a moment is wasted. It‚Äôs a rollercoaster of emotions and genres, and by the time it‚Äôs over, you just want to hit repeat | Achilles last stand - led zeppelin | Temple of Love ('92) by Sisters of Mercy
And
Call Of Ktulu by Metallica 

Old school goth or old school thrash!
(yes, I'm an old, old-school, metalhead!) | Althea 2013 remastered- greatful dead | √Åra b√°tur by Sigur R√≥s | Sympathy For The Devil - Rolling Stones | Arriving somewhere but not here | Mew - Comforting Sounds.

One of my favourite memories is listening to this song while watching the sunrise with a bunch of school mates. | I won't let you go (Darlin') by Hedley | Every king gizzard and the lizard Wizard song, but The Dripping Tap, Hypertension, and Flamethrower are some really good contenders | Big booty mixes by two friends (all 25 of them so far) | Willie the Pimp by Frank Zappa featuring Captain Beefheart. It really showcases Frank‚Äôs ability on the guitar and just keeps building on itself. | Black No 1. | Run like an antelope, by phish | Yes - Close To The Edge | Ted Nugent: Stranglehold | Time | Any song by Rush.

Most of their Songs are 6+ min and imo the length of the Songs fits to the asthetic very well. 

Might be biased, i like Metal and long Songs anyhow:) | Wishbone Ash - The King will come | lost boy - jaden smith | [Maggot Brain By Funkadelic](https://open.spotify.com/track/5WJU527RQNyMLuKecjsL8V?si=LOVM_jw_Ro-n4rFRIXd-Dw) | Deadmau5 - strobe | Deadmau5 strobe, no doubt | Buckethead - Soothsayer | Dream sweet in sea major | Beethoven's 9th Symphony | Crow, Pt. 2 - Mount Eerie | Venice Bitch - Lana Del Rey | chaiyya chaiyya song from dil se movie | Genesis - The Lamia | Reptile by Periphery! | Highlander (the one) - Lost Horizon

They forgot about this song, but I didnt. I was there in the before times of the internet. | Bad guy-eminem | Papa was a Rolling Stone-Temptations | Free bird | O Superman by Laurie Anderson | Windowlicker
(especially for the thing that happens at 4:50) | ‚ÄúFrom the ashes of the fallen‚Äú by mercenary | Pink Floyd: Dogs, Comfortably Numb, Shine on Crazy Diamond

Lynard Skynard: Freebird

Led Zeppelin: Stairway to Heaven, Dazed and Confused, Since I‚Äôve Been Loving You

Eagles: Hotel California | All too well (10min version) | Child In Time - Deep Purple | I think the most overlooked Eagles song is *The Last Resort*. | The lady of shalott loreena mckennitt | It‚Äôs a generic answer but ‚ÄòFree Bird‚Äô. Every second is incredible | The decline NOFX it changes so much and really dosnt have a chorus (its also like 18 minutes long) | Rap God | Stranglehold by Ted Nugent. It's the only song by him I like, but I really love the groove it has. I always get this mental image of a church band playing while they pass the collection plate and every one dancing. Just a great bass and drum part¬† | Jambi | Tempest by Tool | Genesis - Firth of Fifth | Homecoming by Green Day | Somebody else by 1975 | Many of my countrymen will consider it a cheesy choice but Faroeste Caboclo by Legi√£o Urbana - it's basically the life story of a kid from a poor region in the country who people always said something was ""wrong"" with him who then moves to the capital, falls in with the wrong crowd and gets involved in a web of drug and arms trafficking, gangs, love and betrayal and then dies in a duel

Also for the people who are interested in history, there are passing mentions to relevant events and news of the time the history was set in, like terrorist attacks that were later revealed to have been staged by the military | My Favorite Things, John Coltrane version. This is a band absolutely firing on all cylinders. [https://youtu.be/ehYM\_cg2DHI?si=LPJxAbaQ3lr\_e-8\_](https://youtu.be/ehYM_cg2DHI?si=LPJxAbaQ3lr_e-8_) | Pneuma - Tool

Lasts almost 12 minutes, but it's so good! | The Decline | Albuquerque weird al | MX - Deftones. You have to sit for 30 minutes if you don't have Spotify premium.

There's also no reason for Rock Lobster to be like 6 minutes long, but it's so great | Arcade Fire - Reflektor | Machine Gun - Jimi Hendrix | Hey Jude. | [Hi Ren](https://youtu.be/s_nc1IVoMxc?si=kNEjXGqep8dAp8qT) | Black Mountain - Bright lights | Living Legends - After hours (extended euro mix) 

..

Song is magical. I can‚Äôt even describe it.

Real Hip Hop ! | Champagne Supernova | Dire straits - Sultans of Swing | Visions of Johanna by Bob Dylan | Beyond The Realms of Death by Judas Priest | the gael but only the parallel tracks version on the going home album from royal scots dragoon guard | The whole abbey road medley, if that counts. | Coloratura by Coldplay | Echoes by Pink Floyd. 

It's 21 minutes long but that's nothing on 2 tabs üòÇ | There are so many answers I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs already been mentioned but My Rajneesh by Sufjan Stevens is so so so beautiful | Layla by Cream | Starless and Lark's Tongue's in Aspic (all V of them) by King Crimson. Echoes and Dogs by Pink Floyd. Pharoah Dance, Bitches Brew, and Agharta by Miles Davis etc. | [Gates of Babylon](https://youtu.be/z03ZRYh4GKY?si=f15ZERxkIEl_mdCm) by Rainbow. Epic in every way, but at under 7 minutes not overly long or self indulgent. Every second progresses the song until that sweet, sweet ending. Utterly propulsive, and showcases some of Dio‚Äôs and Blackmore‚Äôs best work. | Nothing Else Matters | ""The Cleansing"" August Birns Red ft. Will Ramos of Lorna Shore | Venice Bitch by Lana Del Rey | Ferien in Algerien - Knorkator | ""Selkies: the endless obsession"" by between the buried and me | Disintegration by Jimmy Eat World | Evie pts I,II,III | In-A-Gadda-Da-Vita | Jesus of Suburbia | Virgo‚Äôs Groove by Beyonc√© | Pnuema by Tool | Celine Dion it‚Äôs all coming back to me now | Clenching the fists of dissent | 1) Handpan 
2) Studio Ghibli soundtracks | How Soon is Now, the Smiths | Free bird | thoroughfare by ethel cain | Wickerman - Pulp

Just amazing lyrics, which capture the gloomy bleakness of 80's Sheffield. All setting the stage for the poignant burst of optimism at the end | Telegraph Road | 21st Century Schizoid Man | Just a hair under 6 minutes at 5:54 but Bohemian Rhapsody needs to be on this list. | 4 your eyes only -jcole |   
[Long season - Fishmans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEGR_PHKK9g)

This live version is a truly transcendental experience. | Boston: Foreplay/Longtime, and curveball, Twilight Force: There and Back Again. | DM Dokuro - Still Here

9 minutes of incredible four-phase song. | NOFX the decline | Funkadelic - Maggot Brain | Innerbloom | American Pie..... | [O Superman by Laurie Anderson](https://youtu.be/Vkfpi2H8tOE) | Two very different songs but both have stream of consciousness type lyrics that draw you in and keep you there: 

Choctaw Bingo by James McMurtry. The Ray Wylie Hubbard version is also acceptable but I prefer the author's version and its more relaxed tempo. There was a *Slate* essay about the song penned near the end of the Bush II years nominating it (only kind of) tongue-in-cheek as our new national anthem, it really did capture the moment that well. 

Box of Rain by Grateful Dead doesn't quite qualify at 5:18 studio version but safe to say that nearly any live version does.  Not even sure what it means, but it all builds to the last two lines to devastating effect, at least to me. Never fails to make my heart ache and understand how brief our time really is here. | Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa live in Amsterdam - I'd Rather Go Blind 9:42 minutes | Hi Ren. No contest | La Ville Strandito by Rush. I know I misspelled that‚Ä¶.
The documentary about it had them practicing it for single take recording for months before they got it done. 
Not too many notes‚Ä¶. | Transatlanticsm | American Pie | Bohemiam Rhapsody + 5 seconds of literally anything | Freebird | November rain - guns n roses. Long version | Pneuma. And lots of others from TOOL | Give me Novocaine/She - Green Day | Welcome home | By Justice

Most people don't know the song, but will know several of the movements in it (mainly Make Me Smile, Colour My World, and Now More Than Ever).

Heck, a lot of early Chicago has great songs over 6 minutes. | A list of ones i like:
Achilles come down - gang of youths

ITLL Happen eventually | Little piece of heaven | Telegraph road by dire straits. 14mins of magic. | KGATLW songs and classical pieces. | Miracles, by Jefferson Starship | Suite ‚ÄúGenesis‚Äù by Godiego. It‚Äôs 20+ minutes and it‚Äôs like the entire song is a mini album inside of an album. | Crumbling castle by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, such an amazing song imo

Honourable mention for me is also Sultans of swing by Dire straits, it‚Äôs ~15 seconds too short to make the list but it‚Äôs a fantastic song that I have a great fondness for. | White Privilege II by Macklemore. A truly moving song that came out when BLM was all in the mainstream. Macklemore makes some truly moving music, even today. | Stranglehold-Ted Nugent

One of my fav songs by them!! Just over 9 minutes | Victim of Changes - Judas Priest | The War On Drugs - Thinking of a Place, the best song to do any sort of work to. | Black lake - Bj√∂rk | The Wind That Shapes The Land by Unleash The Archers | [Gorecki by Lamb](https://youtu.be/kbUfDXrWgbs?si=QF_H_7RlXX635vRj) is 6 minutes and 39 seconds and is only outdone by the 9 minute and 46 seconds remix by [Global communication](https://youtu.be/KBMaBYE-Awo?si=fOVD_SmKONUFwnfX) | The Decline by NOFX: 18 minutes of punk rock shredding, it perfectly rises and falls to high highs and low lows, one of my favorites! | It‚Äôs French but ""Notes pour trop tard"" of Orelsan. It‚Äôs like 8min song but so many lyrics in that one are so meaningful | Bohemian Rhapsody | Keane-everybody‚Äôs changing | Prayers for Rain - The Cure | Baker Street- Gerry Rafferty

It's basically his own interpretation of Maggot Brian by Funkadelic | Venice beach - Lana Del Rey | Tool - The Pot | I could list all of the progressive rock songs that meet this criteria, but we‚Äôd be here all night. | I have a playlist called Long Boys just for songs like thus. My favourites are - Black Swan by TWRP and The Dripping Tap by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard | Impossible Soul - Sufjan Stevens. Shit is 25 minutes. The Age of Adz is a divisive album of his but I think it's brilliant. | 2112 - Rush | You Enjoy Myself | Impossible soul - Sufjan Stevens | Ghost Love Score - Nightwish | Hallogallo by Neu!

Trans Europe Express by Kraftwerk (especially the Minimum Maximum concert version with the background video!)

It was done by a DJ and producer who at that time worked at the Fraunhofer institute for sound research, engineering and development.

His artist name was Oliver Prime, the track is Netherworld by L.S.G. (Oliver Lieb). The song is a technical masterpiece and exploring a wide range of sound, arrangement is supreme.

[Their Midnight Special performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzCn8rQvyOo) is the only time I've ever seen a musician directly ""play"" the sound board during a performance.

Honestly most of these band's songs are probably 6min+, it comes with the genre. And they're all great. | Not quite 6 mins but 5:47. Kings and Queens by 30 seconds to mars | O Children - nick cave and the bad seeds | Blackbird - Alter Bridge | Hurricane, Bob Dylan | One - Metallica | ‚ÄúLife‚Äôs Been Good‚Äù by Joe Walsh | Maybe this is just me, but Jesus of Suburbia by Green Day | American Pie, Stairway to Heaven & Boheim Rhapsody | Mirrors | Not scrolling to find it all the way at the bottom, but ""In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3"" by Coheed and Cambria | Damage Inc - Metallica | The Stone Roses - I Am The Resurrection | Queen of Dark Horizons, by Rhapsody (Of Fire). EPIC track, never fails to get me hyped. | Desolation Row - Bob Dylan. Great story about this song‚Ä¶

Recorded live on the 2nd take with Nashville musicians who stumbled into his session in NYC. He was so impressed with their skills, he recorded his next few albums in Nashville. This started a trend of many rock and folk musicians recording in Nashville and rock and country music blended a little after this. | Papa was a rolling stone- the temptations | [Hazy - Universe](https://youtu.be/Dhw-hP2MPw4) | Mirrors by Justin Timberlake | Telegraph Road by Dire Straits | Periphery -Reptile | Machine Gun 'Live' - Jimi Hendrix | Seek and Destroy - Metallica | Hotel California | Champagne supernova by oasis | Angry Eyes - Loggins and Messina | Urban Assault Vehicle - limp Bizkit | Ride - Leave Them All Behind | Wings for Marie pt 1 and 2. A song that keeps me crying with anger almost every time. Tool are on another level of lyricism and melodity. I like songs like that. Same with Slipknot's songs. Even if they sound hard/screamo, they are melodic | It's All Coming Back to Me Now - Celine Dion | Meatloaf- Paradise by the Dashboard Light

And also most live Grateful Dead | Guns N' Roses - November Rain | Rapper's Delight | Pictures of You by The Cure | Foreplay/Long time - Boston | Bury the Light by Casey Edwards (Part of the Devil May Cry 5 soundtrack) - the only 9 minute song I‚Äôd ever listen to on repeat | Achilles Come Down | Temptations,¬† Papa Was A Rolling Stone | ‚ÄúComforting Sounds‚Äù by Mew.

Happy Feelings ~ Maze
Holding Onto You ~ Sananda Mattea | Solar Fields - The Missing | Rush's Xanadu, | Freebird | Euphoria by Kendrick Lamar

Anything by Fela Kuti | Pneuma by Tool | Pyramids | Shine on you crazy diamond | ‚ÄúFuneral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding‚Äù by Elton John | Bury the light | I can‚Äôt really choose between Foals Spanish Sahara or Sonic Youth The Diamond Sea, both epic and life changing | Alice‚Äôs Restaurant Massacree by Arlo Guthrie | In The Garden of Eden, a rock and/or roll song by I Ron Butterfly | Jungleland - Bruce Springsteen | Free Bird | Over 12 years ago, I made a list of full-length albums that were only a single track, which is now well over 500 entries, and a lot more I have not had the time to add. You could probably pick any one out of the top 100 and it'd be well worth a listen. [https://rateyourmusic.com/list/renkls/an-extensive-list-of-single-track-albums/](https://rateyourmusic.com/list/renkls/an-extensive-list-of-single-track-albums/) | Friends of Mr Cairo | Free bird | Strobe - Deadmau5 | Have you heard of a songwriter called Jim Steinman? His songs tend to take an ""if less is more, more must be most"" approach.

Bat Out of Hell, I'd Do Anything for Love (but I won't do the last things in the verses or the stuff mentioned in the duet portion that starts 9 minutes in), Total Eclipse of the Heart, Holding Out for a Hero (depending on the version), It's All Coming Back To Me Now...

He writes long songs but they're great. | As a Dream Theater fan, I will abstain from the answer. | I‚Äôm a big fan of Crush by Dave Matthews Band.  The full version is 8 minutes and it has just a good, smooth vibe.

And it is indeed Crush, not a typo.  Crash into me is a different song. | November Rain, Guns n Roses
Such a slow build to an iconic guitar solo. | Wakin on a Pretty Day - Kurt Vile | Edit the sad parts by Modest Mouse | Congratulations - Jimmy eat world | Guys please stop commenting great songs! Now I already have a waiting list of more than 2 days. I don't have enough time to listen to all of them | All Too Well 10min version - Taylor Swift | Master of Puppets - Metallica  
TY Stranger Things to introduce me to it. | 90210 by Travis Scott | Breaking out and Keep quiet by The Protomen | Hurricane - Bob dylan | Starla by the smashing pumpkins | Space Lion - Yoko Kanno - Cowboy Bepop soundtrack. I don't hand out ""masterpiece"" often, but this song certainly deserves it.

Rime of the Ancient Mariner - Iron Maiden - listen to both the album version and the Live After Death version to determine your favorite, should you enjoy the 13+ minute song.

Fly to the Rainbow - Scorpions - this before they hit it big in the US. Absolutely must be heard with headphones to be appreciated for its audio acoustics.

Orbital - The Brown Album - note: to fully enjoy the album as intended, look for the hour+ long version online as this removes the breaks between the broken songs which ruin it as found on every streaming platform out there. Why this album was broken down to individual track is unknown but this is not how it plays on the CD, hence find the 1+ hour version online. Oh, and if you're not a fan of techno or electronic music, this may not be for you.

Confusion - New Order - it's better known as the rave song in the movie Blade.

Sympathy for the Devil - Rolling Stones - classics never get old and this one still holds up today.

Blinded by the Light - Mannfred Mann's Earth Band - another classic. You're likely to recognize it immediately when it starts.

Mama - Genesis - definitely not a radio airplay song, but from their self titled album. One of my favorites from the group.

And finally rounding out this definitely-limited list is In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida - Iron Butterfly -  17 minutes of ear ecstasy, and if you have Mary Jane over as a guest, well, it's definitely made for the both of you.

Enjoy the songs you'll add to your playlists. :) | Oh boy r/toolband | Runaway- By he who shall not be named | Dopesmoker - Sleep | Thick as a brick!! | ok this one is just 5 minutes, but def I Don't Want to Miss a Thing - Aerosmith | Close to the edge by Yes | Invalid Litter Dept | Transatlanticism | American Pie by Don McLean | Layla by Eric Clapton | Jesus of Suburbia, by Greenday | Scenes from an Italian restaurant (as a bonus I'm listening to Giorgio by moroder as I'm writing this) | The Rain Song - Led Zeppelin

Some of these other songs are classics but there is something about this song that my adhd brain just can't pass once it starts | Unnatural selection by muse | Dopesmoker by Sleep. | Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Iron Maiden | Bat out of hell is a doozy at 8 or 9 minutes | Well, The Greatest Show by Nightwish is worth every freaking second but it's a little longer than 6 mins. | Betrayed by a7x | ""Sing About Me/Dying of Thirst"" - Kendrick Lamar | I'm late to the conversation but--surprise to not see Free Bird by Lynyrd Skynyrd and Green Grass and High Tides by The Outlaws | All My Friends - LCD Soundsystem | Objects in the Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer Than They Are by Meat Loaf (music and lyrics by Jim Steinman)

Ten minute song. Incredible. | Foreplay/Long Time | If you like semi-pretentious 20+ minutes songs by chronically ill composers, with a women doing a heartbreaking spoken word piece as the vocals‚Ä¶check out I Trawl The Megahertz by Paddy McAloon. I‚Äôm not usually into that sort of thing, but I heard it once years ago and now it‚Äôs one of my all-time favorite pieces of art. Stumbled on it for the first time within the month after my grandmother died in my arms, and it hit like a ton of bricks considering the song is from the POV of an old woman telling herself the story of her own life as she lays dying.¬†

Edit: Just realised that song is much shorter than I remembered, sorry! | Biffy Clyro - Cop Syrup ü§ò | The Decline by NOFX

I got to hear it live a couple of weeks ago, and it was everything I hoped for. Also impressed that in 18 minutes Fat Mike only fucked up once | Shine on you crazy diamond by pink floyd | ""Moya"" | Green Grass and High Tides. Great song but you need to focus to enjoy it and need a break afterwards. The song is a tribute to all the best songs of the time. | Papa was a Rolling Stone. | Working man by Rush | november rain | Innuendo of Freddy mercury that it‚Äôs his last album | Night Verses - Phoenix IV: Levitation | Reflektor - Arcade Fire | The Beauty of the Beast by Nightwish | Hi Ren | ""Change of seasons"" Dream theatre | Carpop by daydream twins | Last Chance - Shooting Star | Echoes by Pink Floyd | Guns N‚Äô Roses - Coma | ‚ÄúHandshake Drugs‚Äù‚Äî Wilco | Call of Cthulhu | The Prophets Song - Queen | Ghost Love Score - Nightwish (Especially the live version from Wakken open air concert 2013)

Simply perfect | Fela Kuti - Expensive Shit | The Rain Formerly Known as Purple | Off the top of my head - 


Faithless - Insomnia
Marek Hammen - Gemini

LSB - Sketch for my Sweetheart 
High Contrast - Lovesick

Ramin Djawadi - The Night King

Led Zeppelin - Stairway to Heaven
Guns n Roses - November Rain | Titus Andronicus - The Battle of Hampton Roads | Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Pink Floyd. Worth every second. | Time by Pink Floyd, album version | Shine on you crazy diamond üíé | Albuquerque - wierd al | Videogame music is like that, but usually it's because you get attached to the song | Mercyful Fate by Metallica. A whopping 11 min | Pain remains part123 lorna shore mmmmmmm | Innerbloom - Rufus Du Sol | Hi Ren by Ren. It's a rabbit hole though. You've been warned. | Nights in White Satin by The Moody Blues.

I didn‚Äôt get the context of the song. üòÇ | Black Sands - Bonobo | I'm such a fan of Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen that I'll stop and sing it near every time it plays, including at the store. | Stranglehold - Ted Nugent | Evie by Stevie Wright | King of long hip hop songs is Joe budden! | Songs in coke studio Pakistan and Balaghal Ulabi by Ali Zafar. 
P.S I'm not Pakistani lol | Mah‚Äôs joint - Jon Bellion | Not sure if it's quite 6 minutes but Say hello to heaven by Temple of the Dog. | Three Days by Jane's Addiction is an absolute banger. | It's technically two songs, but they're to be played as one.

""J√§√§st√§ syntynyt/Varjojen virta"" and ""Tuleen ajettu maa"" by Moonsorrow. 56 minutes and 29 seconds of awesomeness.

Another would be ""In the Shadow of our Pale Companion"" by Agalloch. 14 minutes and 45 seconds. | Anesthesia by Porcupine Tree | Thinking of a Place - The War on Drugs | Free Bird by Lynyrd Skynyrd | Fear of the dark - Iron maiden | It‚Äôs a meme, but ‚ÄúFreebird‚Äù is legit a great classic rock and especially Southern rock song. | Nightwish has a fair few.. Top of head is Greatest Show On Earth and Ghost Love Score | Change by Oingo Boingo. | All too well by Taylor swift (10 min version) | Im so fresh you can suck my nuts | Venice Bitch | YOB, Catharsis. | Soothsayer | In no particular order:

1. Tubular Bells
2. Stairway to Heaven (Led Zeppelin)
3. Bohemian Rhapsody (ok 5:55 so sue me üòÖ) | Pneuma | Exist by Avenged Sevenfold. 15 minutes of pure instrumental flexing that somehow gives a moving and quite chilling tale/warning to humanity. | Pneuma - Tool 
Perfect build up and the most immaculate guitar tone, amazing drums | Paradise by the dashboard lights | Allman brothers ‚ÄúLive at Fillmore East‚Äù

Just about every song on that album is over 6 minutes and that album is perfection. | Kraftwerk - Autobahn. | There are a bunch from homestuck, but I would say Cascade. That is cheating a little bit since it's technically 3 songs combined though. | ‚ÄúI Dream A Highway‚Äù Gillian Welsh | Stairway to Heaven | The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald | The Call of Ktulu | Bell Witch - Mirror Reaper | Land of make believe by Chuck mangione. I think it‚Äôs brilliant. | The Mars Volta- Cassandra Gemini | Sick Sad Little World by Incubus | New order blue Monday | Not considering genre:

Last Night on Earth - FreqGen Remix by Celldweller and FreqGen

Dissolved Girl by Massive Attack (used in the wake up, Neo scene from The Matrix, for reference)

Take Control by Old Gods of Asgard (Yes, the very same you are thinking they are. They also go by Poets of The Fall for their music outside of the lore of Control/Alan Wake. Really good group, highly recommended).

Sing About Me, I‚Äôm dying of thirst - Kendrick Lamar

It is one of their most instrumental songs and the lyrics are just the telling of a story. | Fade to black - Metallica | Terrapin Station- grateful dead | The majority of Joanna Newsom songs | Pyramids by Frank Ocean | Wind guide you - Jeremy Soule

Maybe this doesn't fit in the traditional answer for this question, but that song is a masterpiece that still gives me goosebumps every time. The buildup is amazing. | Let it happen - tame Impala¬† | Change by Karnivool | DJ Shadow - Blood on the motorway | [Opus - Eric Prydz](https://youtu.be/gt1pKrwxAJU?si=8ijYU6_CDFpyOLfr)

They have quite a few 13-15 minute songs all worth every minute. | Stimela (the train song) by Hugh Masekela | Take Me Back to Eden - Sleep Token | Ball & A Biscuit by the White Stripes | Holy Wars‚Ä¶ The Punishment Due by Megadeth | Freebird | Voodo Chile - Jimmy Hendrix | Woe to ye, the people of order | Hey Jude by The Beatles | The New World Symphony by Dvorak. | Free Bird | Cherry - Ratatat | Green Grass and High Tides | Bohemian rhapsody | Dance with the devil - immortal technique | Any 10+ minute song from Nightwish is a masterpiece. | Heavy Horses by Jethro Tull | Concrete Angel (Original Mix) - Gareth Emery ft. Cristina Novelli | The greatest show on earth, Nightwish. 

Maybe not every minute, outro is a bit long. But you can also just cut it off at that point without losing anything imo | I was waiting for someone to say this‚Ä¶

But... my God... if you're unfamiliar with the movie and true story it's based on, don't worry, the song stands on its own. ""Gortoz A Ran"", Denez Prigent and Lisa Gerrard.

 Just close your eyes and enjoy the ride. The song is beautiful,  sad and haunting all at once.... it brings you up then lowers you emotionally to the brink of tears through something unexplainable,  but it's there. I've broken down to this song once or twice.  

https://youtu.be/dwRjaaU3Fhg?si=EE9Peqh0bXlgG08x | Venice Bitch - Lana del Rey | The Weight of Dreams - Greta Van Fleet | wild horses | All Too Well (Taylor‚Äôs Version) (10 minute version) | Alice‚Äôs Restaurant.  Story ends thinking it is about Alice and her restaurant if you don‚Äôt listen all the way through | At 5:50 I really enjoy The Mars Volta‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Widow‚Äù | 6 minutes is not long. You need to expand your horizons. I regularly listen to metal songs over 10 minutes in length. Take Wintersun's Way Of The Fire just as one shining example. | A couple more modern selections: 


Ween - Woman And Man 

My Morning Jacket - Touch Me I'm Going To Scream pt 2 

Destroyer - Kaputt 

Jeff Rosenstock - Bang on the Door - June 21st  (this is a medley of like 5 songs but it kinda stands as one song and is one of the best things ever. Near the end of the ""Worry"" album) | From Dave Matthews Band:

The Stone

The Dreaming Tree

Crush

The Last Stop | Jump to it- aretha franklin 
& outstanding- gap band | Feels so Good, Chuck Mangione | sludge factory - Alice In Chains | November rain. 
Rap God | Konstantine by Something Corporate | Trapped in the drivethrough | November Rain- Guns N Roses

Layla- Derek & The Dominos | Shine on you crazy Diamond | No One Will Save You by Aviators | Pillow talking by Lil Dicky is good for a laugh everytime. | Easily Embarrassed - Reincarnation.

Strike that, most of their songs are perfection. | The Doors - Light My Fire | Deacon Blues | Harry Chapin had a bunch of 6+ minute songs that were great stories: Taxi, Sequel, Sniper, A Better Place to Be, Mr. Tanner (slightly less than six minutes but still great). | Pretty sad that 6+ minutes is considered a ‚Äúlong song‚Äù. I‚Äôll say Daphnis and Chloe by Ravel | Two men in love by The Irrepressibles | Stormy Monday - Allman Brothers Live at the Filmore East | Away from the Mire - Billy Strings | Great White Buffalo by Ted Nugent | The place where he inserted the blade - black country new road | Much of Iron Maiden but let's go with Alexander the Great. | COMFORTABLY NUMB LIVE !!!üíØ | In keeping Secrets of Silent Earth:3 - Coheed and Cambria 

8 mins 12 seconds | Innerbloom by R√ºf√ºs Du Sol | Paradise by the dashboard light | ‚ÄúAmen Omen‚Äù by Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals, especially the Live at the Hollywood Bowl version. | The Highwayman by Phil Ochs. That one really gets me.

https://youtu.be/A9fWjzYiRUE?si=t-TjulpEhWYpKPXX | One for the Road - Sturgill Simpson. 

King of Oklahoma - Jason Isbell & The 400 Unit the live version from Live From The Ryman Vol. 2

Those are my two most recent additions to that list | Drifting Back by Neil Young (28 plus min.) | Bury The Light.

Its a theme song for a villian and probably a modern day classic in terms of how big and important that is for a characters arc. Vergil earned that one. The componist wanted to give just 6 minutes but as a fan squeezed out 3 more. 9 minutes of pure epicness. 

It deserves to be mentioned. | Bury The Light.

Pentagrams - Smashing Pumpkins

Jaguar God by Mastodon | 

[linkwood- Love Lost](https://youtu.be/EpoXqIRS8Ts?si=80tleVLaAtDXeiTh) | This may be a controversial choice, but I'd say ""The Eve of the War"" from Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds concept album from 1978. It feels like parody now but if you give in to the earnestness it's a real joyride. | The Decline by NOFX 

It's 18 minutes long but every second is fucking amazing. | (Disclaimer: these are metal :D)¬†¬†


Widower - Dillinger Escape Plan¬†


White Walls - Between the Buried and Me¬†

**All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor‚Äôs Version) [From The Vault] | Ghost Love Score by Nightwish. | I Appear Missing by Queens of the Stone Age. Favorite song of all time. Great story building, great imagery. Immaculate instrumentals and vocals | Red Barchetta - Rush

Adding to this, even though they aren‚Äôt quite 6 minutes: The Big Money by Rush clocking in at 5:36 and Subdivisions by Rush clocking in at 5:35.

As a little kid, I made him play it on repeat ALL the time. Anytime the drive was over 30 min 

I memorized every word (15 min song) and could sing it without any beat or lyrics. I know it still but I can‚Äôt do the verses in order | Impossible Soul - Sufjan Stevens. It's 25 minutes long and worth every second! | Something Corporate - Konstantine | Take Me Back To Eden- Sleep Token | Achilles Come Down

Its one of the best songs ive ever heard | Tangerine Dream - Phaedra

Yun Hi Chala Chal from Swades;

Aye Khuda from Murder 2;

In Dino from Life in a Metro;

Luka Chuppi from Rang De Basanti;

Abhi Mujh Mein Kahi from Agneepath;

Mard Maratha from Panipat;

Taal se Taal from Taal. | Free Bird - Lynryd Skynyrd

Highway Song - Blackfoot | venice bitch by lana is one of the songs of all time | The combined Jackson Browne song Loud Out-Stay. They're *technically* two separate songs, but I will argue all the way to my grave that it just needs to be one merged song. The end of Load Out and the beginning of Stay are so jarring without their companion songs. | DayDreamer - Traveling Light¬† | The Antikythera Mechanism by BT. I especially love it with nosie cancelling earbuds and looking up at the dark night  sky. | Take Me Back to Eden by Sleep Token | Concierto de Aranjuez - Jim Hall | Octavarium by Dream Theater
Count of Tuscany by Dream Theater
Cosmic Symphony by Flying Colors
Reptile by Periphery
War of Being by TesseracT | Street Hassle by Lou Reed | Angel of Salvation by Galneryus | Lateralus by Tool | Let it happen by Tame Impala | Italian Restaurant by Billy Joel. I love that song more than I can explain. | I‚Äôm Going Home - Ten Years After

also Internal Flight by Estas Tonne | Salt - RY X. Only - RY X. Falling Night - Nuit Ocean. 

They fall a little short on the 6 minute mark. BUT man what beautiful songs. Worth every second for sure. | Condition of the heart- prince | Dogs - Pink Floyd | Sentimental mood by steps ahead with Michael Brecker on EWI | stairway to heaven by led zeppelin | Heavyweight - infected mushroom | [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw3SdOFmubU) | Neverland by Marillion | Goin Down Slow by Boz Scaggs and Duane Allman. | Masterpiece - King's Singers. A must listen for anyone who loves acapella music. | Marquee moon by television | Honorable mentions to two that missed the mark by about 10 seconds short, Sunlit Souls‚Äô Desperados on the Run, and the goat Queen‚Äôs Bohemian Rhapsody. The winner for me is Non-Stop from Hamilton. | Bohemian Rhapsody | Pyramids Frank Ocean!!! | PYRAMIDS -Frank Ocean | Most of Opeth‚Äôs catalogue. | Mountain Jam, The Allman Bros. | Grace- Arturo Cardelus 
9:34 run time. No vocals. Just piano with philharmonic accompaniment. He also did the music for the Netflix biodrama for pope Francis. | Most of the songs by gang of youths. Achilles come down is one of the best ones | Dry the Rain by Beta Band | Rap God by Eminem | The Beatles - I Want You (She‚Äôs so Heavy). Despite the repetitive lyrics, Paul McCartney‚Äôs bass line is one of my favorites of all time. | Explosions In The Sky - Your Hand In Mine | Stan | Warsaw or the First Breath You Take After You Give Up by Them Crooked Vultures | NOFX The Decline. 18 minutes of awesome. | kiss from a rose | Calling occupation of interplanetary craft-klatu | Metallica - One and Master of Puppets | lover you should've come over üíöüíöüíö | ‚ÄúNo Stars‚Äù by Rebekah Del Rio ü•Ä

Both incredible stories that keep you interested for the entire song. | We Major | MacArthur Park. Some of those lyrics are goofy as hell but that song don‚Äôt stop. | New dark age - The Sound !!! | 10 Years Gone - Led Zeppelin | 2112 by Rush (although it's been split into different parts, it is technically all one song that's over 20 minutes long) | Oltremare by Ludovico Einaudi | Delta by Mumford and Sons | Astronomy - Blue √ñyster Cult | Ghost Love Score by Nightwish. https://youtu.be/JYjIlHWBAVo | Alice‚Äôs restaurant massacre

They closed a majority of their albums with some epic songs! | Don mclean- American Pie | Only in Dreams by Weezer and Feels So Good by Chuck Mangione | Purple Rain | Of Montreal - The Past is a Grotesque Animal

Hmmm. Actually there is one minute that's a bit samey. | November rain

I would do anything for love but I won‚Äôt do that | Space cadet by kyuss is pure desert rock | ‚ÄúTadow‚Äù by FKJ and Masego | Bat Out of Hell. and any YES song lol | Impossible Soul - Sufjan Stevens | Awolnation - Knights of Shame | The Decline by NOFX. It is the greatest punk song ever. It will never be topped. The lyrics are smart and poignant and the music is amazing. | Prog metal has entered the chat saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù. | So close no matter how far, couldn't be much more from the heart. | I Heard It Through The Grapevine - Creedence Clearwater Revival version. | Hurricane - Bob Dylan | One by Metallica | Kashmir by Led Zeppelin ftw! | it‚Äôs all coming back to me now | The Poet and the Pendulum by Nightwish | Ghost Love Score - Nightwish

Dancing Mad - Nobuo Uematsu (FFVI) | Cold Little Heart by Michael Kiwanuka | Slaves and bulldozers  by Soundgarden | Alice's Restaurant. | Love to love you baby by Donna summer | Pyramids Frank Ocean https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dMV31MWIjLE&pp=ygUUcHlyYW1pZHMgZnJhbmsgb2NlYW4%3D | F R E E B I R D | Any Pink Floyd song | Down by the River - Neil Young | Marquee Moon - Television | Short change hero by the heavy | The two that came instantly to my mind were The Mariner's Revenge Song by the Decemberists, and Short Stories with Tragic Endings by From Autumn to Ashes.

Mariner's Revenge Song still holds up and is a great time, especially the live performances.

Short Stories I'm not sure if I'd still be into without the nostalgia factor, but I love it. | Anything by Fela Kuti | Achilles come down | Space Wrangler - Widespread Panic | Yello - The Race (12‚Äù version).   13 mins of sonic awesomeness! | None. 

I believe all songs should be cut down to the actual song part.

I do not play any instrument, so I have no reason to pretend that all of the instrumentalist-masturbation-noise of solos sound good.

I get that person practiced a lot to play 1000 notes per minute on the guitar, but why would anyone listen to that? Are you imagining yourself playing 1000 notes per minute on the guitar? What is anyone enjoying when they hear that racket? Because I know you‚Äôre not enjoying that lovely tune, there is none. It‚Äôs no more a song than a wind-chime playing random notes. | In every dream home a heartache- Roxy music
Bella lugosi's dead- Bauhaus
The Rockefeller skank- Fatboy slim
Any song by Muete 
Lots of songs by Tool | If I could fly by Joe Satriani | Crazy diamond - pink floyd. Also every song on the Animals album by them as well. | Wings for Marie pt1 and Ten thousand days pt2 by Tool | JESUS OF SUBURBIAAAAA | ""Destiny"" - Journey 

Also, I realize that ""Feelin' That Way"" and ""Anytime"" are separate songs, but the radio station I listened to while growing up always played the live versions from ""Captured"" back to back and it seemed like one song. | Take Me Back To Eden - Sleep Token | Achilles Come Down | My Favorite Things - John Coltrane | Goodnight Saigon by Billy Joel | Stairway to Heaven ‚Äî Led Zepplin

If you haven't listened to it in a while, put on your best pair of headphones, close your eyes, and enjoy. | 13 Angels Sitting On My Broken Windowsill - BT | Sunchyme by Dario G | Not gonna be everyone's cup of tea, but I really enjoy ""I"" by Meshuggah | Dance with the devil - Immortal technique | Invincible - Tool | Rosetta Stoned by TOOL. An absolute masterpiece of a song, with such a litany of hidden themes crushed between insane guitar riffs and dirty, insanity fueled lyrics. Culminating in one of the best endings I've ever heard. I'm not big into hard rock or metal, but I've listened to that album and that song in particular countless times. 

The lead in song going into it adds a bit more context. If you wanna know what insanity probably feels like, go in blind, crank the volume to max, sit back, and enjoy the most trippy journey into the hells of the deep dark parts of the human mind | Periphery - omega | ‚ÄúSkull and Crossbones‚Äù by Wind Rose. | One more time, One more chance | A Little Piece Of Heaven- A7X | Short by a few seconds but Bohemian Rhapsody | Station to Station by David Bowie | Kashmir by Led Zep | Clubbed to Death | Only in Dreams by Weezer. The lyrics are short and the song slows down. Then, it builds back up and has an amazing guitar solo. One of my all time faves. | Liberation - OutKast | Airiel - 500 Deep | Coheed and Cambria - in keeping secrets of silent earth 3

Man your fuckin jackhammers‚Ä¶ | Ghost love score | Can't you see The Marshall Tucker band | The Unforgiven II by Metallica - a classic.

My personal favs:  
All Nightmare Long  
The Day That Never Comes

  
And of course hearing Shine On You Crazy Diamond for the first time is a truly lifechanging experience. | The Veldt - Deadmau5 | The count of Tuscany ~ dream theater

I probably listened to this song 50 times in 2022 when I found out about it. It's like 4 songs in one. | The count of Tuscany ~ dream theater

I probably listened to this song 50 times in 2022 when I found out about it. It's like 4 songs in one. | Let it Happen - Tame Impala, People only remeber the last 2 mins of the song but in all honesty the first 8 minutes are also very good and worth listening to as much as the last 2 minutes | Touch me I'm going to scream pt 2 - My Morning Jacket

In fact a lot of Tool‚Äôs catalogue consists of long tracks that are almost always worth it. | Jesus of suburbia by Green Day | Memorial by Susanne Sundf√∏r ‚ú® | Hurricane by Bob Dylan, it's basically a true crime podcast but as an 8.5 minute song. It raised funds and awareness that eventually contributed to the overturning of a wrongful conviction.

So, a lot like the Serial podcast, but from the 70s. | ""Spirit Ceusher"" by Death - r.i.p.

Highly recommend with headphones, earbuds or a good stereo speakers. | Thinking of a place - The war on drugs | Familiarity by The Punch Brothers

It‚Äôs some of the best instrumentals I have ever heard. | Eagles - The Last Resort | Death is the Road to Awe - Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet

Pet Shop Boys - Left To My Own Devices

Edit: the somg I'm thinking of is,  Through the fire and the flames. | ATWTMV | Dogs pink floyd | The Decline - NOFX | Take Me Back to Eden by Sleep Token | Blackbird - Alter Bridge

It‚Äôs a slow burn but a truly excellent 9m24s song. | Jesus of Suburbia by Green Day | ""The Lost Rapper Experience"" by KXNG Crooked | I used to love The Box, by Orbital like in the 90's. It doesn't have the same serotonin affect because I've listened to it too many times unfortunately. | Kashmir by Led Zeppelin

All Coming Back to Me Now by Celine Dion

Paradise by the Dashboard Lights by Meatloaf

My music taste is eclectic | The Laat Baron - mastodon | Tool.

So many other incredible Baroque/Classical pieces are over 6 minutes...

Technically 5:59, but with every second. | Greatest Show on Earth by Nightwish. It's 24 minutes, but worth every single second.

Albuquerque - Weird Al Yankovic | ‚ÄúChorus of the Hebrew Slaves‚Äù any version. | Papa Was a Rolling Stone. | Achilles Come Down by Gang of Youths was my most listened to song on Spotify a few years back.

Chills | Free Bird | Stone Roses - I am the resurrection | Dashboard Lights | Anniversary - Tony, Toni, Ton√© | Shine on You Crazy Diamond by Pink Floyd | Perennial Quest by Death or Floods by Pantera.

I know it‚Äôs technically broken up into smaller pieces in the actual score, but it‚Äôs often performed in one continuous piece over 6 mins. It‚Äôs quite the journey for me. | Lybernum Wits End Liberation Fly by Moss Icon

An older emo song from the proto ages of the genre when it was just starting to form from the ends of the more hardcore punk movements (recorded in 1988, way before its time). Starts slow, but gradually picks up until you're basically listening to screamed esoteric apocalypse preaching. Very good song for catharsis. If you like it, I recommend listening to the rest of the album by the same name. Truly one of those albums and bands that were just doing their thing too early to be properly paid attention.

Side notes: I scrolled for a long time specifically looking for someone else recommending this song and was surprised it hadn't come up while other songs did. I saw Black No. 1 by Type O Negative and Strobe by Deadmau5 multiple times each, and, while I do love both songs, they also both have solid radio edits that I'd argue do some well-needed trimming of chaff. Anyway, I also saw Marquee Moon by Television pop up a couple of times and I absolutely agree. That song is amazing, and I fully recommend everyone dig into Television's discography. The band helped set the foundation that New York punk and experimental rock built off of, and you can really tell. | Funeral for a friend - Love lies bleeding | The pot by TOOL | Paradise by the Dashboard Lights - Meatloaf | blue monday - new order | Everyone's throwing out legendary classics which absolutely no complaints about. But something newer would be Sleep Tokens - The Summoning. | If you like slow songs ‚ÄúA House In Nebraska‚Äù by Ethel Cain | every song from racionais mcs | Alice‚Äôs Restaurant. | The decline NOFX | Bohemian Rhapsody | Ghost Love Score by Nightwish.

The version I recommend is a love performance at the Wacken Music festival. Listen to the whole thing, the climax is something else.

I can't believe I didn't find this comment here yet. | Justice for Saint Mary, by Diablo Swing Orchestra. | The Dripping Tap by King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard | The biggest miss I see on this list so far is the most obvious one. Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen | achilles come down by gang of youths | Bauhaus ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" | Fearless - Pink Floyd | Autobahn by Kraftwerk | The Mars Volta ""L'via L'viaquez"" | All Too Well (10 Minute Version) - Taylor Swift

There's other bands that do great long songs, but imo nothing comes close to Yes (Other than maybe Genesis) | Tiny Dancer- Elton John | Amazing part 3 - Dave East | Ren - Hi ren

This is more of an art piece and you need to see the video to really get the full experience. It's 9 minutes long and it doesn't feel like it. I've lost count of how many times I have watched it.

Invalid Litter Dept - At The Drive-in (people don't talk about this song enough, it's so good) | Jesus of suburbia - Green Day | Thanks for sharing! üåü | I suspect this won't get too much attention but I've always been fond of Pet Shop Boys, Always on my Mind from the Introspective album.

Its a 14 minute masterpiece in my opinion, not only is the story the song tells good, but the 4 minute instrumental part  really adds to it being a great song.

Dire Straits-Romeo and Juliet. Its exactly 6 minutes and also delivers a great love story.

Dire Straits-Brothers in Arms. The spotify version is 7 minutes and its one of the best anti war songs i heard so far.

7:17 of Nena at her finest. | [Whirring - Joy Formidable](https://youtu.be/RGTcNNVufmg?si=2j--1FhbMPmgc2nN)

The song reflects themes of inner turmoil, isolation, and difficulty in communicating one's true emotions. Rhiannon comes across as experiencing deep, personal feelings that others cannot fully understand or perceive, creating a sense of disconnect. Despite efforts to express these feelings, they ""fall short,"" indicating frustration with the limitations of communication.

Additionally, the presence of the ""invisible friend"" points to an internal struggle, possibly symbolizing anxiety, loneliness, or a mental state that disrupts peace and sleep. The song portrays a sense of frustration with both external relationships and internal battles, with feelings of isolation and misunderstood emotions.

And then the outro hits, wavering in melancholy, but over the course of three minutes, it triumphantly ends the song in abject joy. You can't help but feel emotions. It's absolutely my favorite piece of shoegaze sonic wall of sound. | Both Transatlanticism and the non-radio version of I will possess your heart by Death Cab for Cutie. Absolute bangers | All too well 10 minute version, Taylor Swift | Lyin‚Äô Eyes (album version) - Eagles | Metallica - Orion.

At the End of the Day - Spock's Beard | Me and your mama by childish gambino. So good i love it. Its like a modern bohemian rhapsody to me with the tempo and genre changes | Fool's Overture by Supertramp. Absolute banger and seems to be largely forgotten | Dream Sweet in Sea Major by Miracle Music

Not your most conventional song, but I think it's wonderful. | Dick Around by Sparks. So many genres wrapped into one song | The Last Baron by Mastodon | The Raindrop That Fell To The Sky - Chris Christodoulou

From the Risk of Rain 2 Soundtrack. If you're unaware, the entire soundtrack slaps and is 100% worth a listen.

This track especially is among my favorites from the game. Musically interesting from a compositional perspective, if you're into that sort of stuff, but mostly it just grooves unbelievably hard, and especially the breakdown halfway through the track is just some of the best music I've ever listened to. | Riders On Storm - The Doors - 7:14 | And Plague Flowers the Kaleidoscope

Absolutely beautiful. | November Rain | Wet Hands by c418. | 2112 by Rush. About 20 minutes long.

Just under 6 minutes but incredible. | Sing About Me, I‚Äôm Dying of Thirst by Kendrick Lamar | Life‚Äôs Been Good - Joe Walsh

Don‚Äôt care if its 5 seconds short. | You guys ever heard ‚ÄúSweet Sticky Thing‚Äù by the Ohio Players? | ‚ÄúThe Impossible Duet‚Äù played by Wells Cunningham on YouTube.

When this song comes on, no matter what I'm doing I just stop and listen.  I'm there in that cab and I will never be anywhere else.  Amazing man.  As extra credit, ""Sequel"" (aka Taxi Part 2) is almost as good.  Played together you have 13 minutes of exceptional storytelling. | Deep Purple - Child In Time | Where the fuck is Freebird? | Every Tool song over 6mins | You could go a bunch of songs on deloused that fit this category but it has to be take the veil cerpin tax by mars volta | American Pie | I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre evil too -pinochio p | Endwalker - Footfalls | Dentist session, always remember every minute | Elton John - Song For Guy | Shine on you crazy diamond | I just know I‚Äôll be downvoted because of who the singer is but:

Just a stunning bit of instrumental guitar music that he performs differently almost every time | When the Wild Wind Blows - Iron Maiden | *Impossible Soul*  -Sufjan Stevens | Freebird | Bohemian Rhapsody | **EUPHORIA BY KENDRICK LAMAR** | Manowar - Achilles, agony and ecstacy in eight parts. | NOFX - The Decline | Mirrors - justin timberlake | Shpongle: Nothing is Something Worth Doing | Pink Floyd - Dogs. | Call of Cthulhu-Metallica | One by Metallica | When I Get Back From New York(both versions) - OPN

Legit has kept me from following through on bad thoughts (which was the writer's original intention for themselves as well). | Jesus of Suburbia | Scarecrow - Avantasia | The Dance of Eternity | A more obscure one: Yndi Halda - Dash and blast.

It goes from ambient-like post rock to an energetic and goosebumps-worthy climax.

Maybe not worth every minute, but there are a lot of minutes :) | Soothsayer by buckethead. Rhyme of the ancient mariner and Alexander the Great by Iron Maiden. Master of puppets and disposable heroes by Metallica. Shine on you crazy diamond all parts and dogs by Pink Floyd. Roundabout by yes. War pigs by Black Sabbath. Ball and a biscuit white stripes. Rinse the raindrops Paul McCartney. Dazed and comfused, stairway to heaven , Achilles last stand by Led Zeppelin. Swim to the moon between the buried and me. I won‚Äôt see you tonight part 1, clairvoyant disease and all things must end by avenged sevenfold. I have more if you want. Lmfao | Starless | What an insane question. There are literally hundreds (no doubt thousands) of amazing songs over 6 minutes depending on your tastes. Give me almost anything off Opeth's first 8 albums and it will be well over 6 minutes and mind-blowingly great for the entire duration. And that's just one band | Bat out of hell ‚Äî meatloaf | Brand New - Limousine

Don McLean - American Pie | November Rain | American Pie by Don McLean | November Rain. | November Rain and Don‚Äôt Cry by Guns N Roses | Heard this song a few weeks ago called Hi Ren that was like 9 minutes along that I liked enough to listen to a few times | Michael Kiwanuka - Cold Little Heart

PS I know it‚Äôs 5:55 not 6+ but who cares close enough | Sweet sounds of heaven, by the one and only Lady Gaga, The Rolling Stones, and Stevie Wonder. 

Listen to the studio version, and then listen to the shortened edit. 

It has to be the best song I‚Äôve heard in the past decade. | The Chair -Orbital¬† | Trapped in the drive-thru | Take Me Back To Eden - Sleep Token. 

They have quite a few 6min plus songs, all are amazing. | I‚Äôd do anything for love (but I won‚Äôt do that) - Meatloaf. 

And the music video is amazing | Omg. This thread is a playlist!   So many good selections.  ‚ù§Ô∏è | Ooh La La La by Teena Marie. The 12‚Äù version is just over 6 minutes. I preform it for my nephew with dancing and singing while he eats. Better than watching Gracie‚Äôs Corner | Bury the Light, by Casey Edwards and Victor Borba. 9 minute long song and I could listen to every second of it on repeat. | Ren - Hi Ren | Clear Skies by DJ Die | the original version of ‚ÄúHoliday‚Äù - Madonna. on streaming they (incorrectly) have the shorter Immaculate Collection edit on her debut album, but it can be found on Celebration, her 2009 greatest hits album. | Hi Ren by Ren.

Truly a piece of art ü´∂ | Mine by Beyonc√© and Chihiro üòì | Comforting Sounds by Mew | Venice Bitch - Lana Del Rey
Pyramids - Frank Ocean 
Thoroughfare - Ethel Cain 

Basic tastes but god I just love them so much | [Camel  - Rajaz](https://youtu.be/S8n3usXreL0?si=CBDvw3FaQG2pya8g) | Watermelon man - Herbie hancock | [Hi Ren (Ren)](https://youtu.be/s_nc1IVoMxc?si=cqxs9ycOmkOzbIwj) | Jacob's Ladder by Rush | So I just realized I've never heard the full 18 minute version (because I didn't know about it), but I really love the 7:20 version of Cat Stevens' Foreigner Suite. It's the ultimate breakup song to me, in that it starts slow and sad, and then gradually picks itself up, and speeds up with time, perspective, and gratitude for his ex.

IYKYK | All too well (10 min version) by Taylor Swift or American Pie by John McClean | Jimmy Eat World - Goodbye Sky Harbor

Taylor Swift - All Too Well

These are the two that immediately came to mind for me. | All too well 10 minute version | Meet the new boss, same as the old boss | #yyyyyyyYYYEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHH | That scream is possibly the best in all of rock and roll. It‚Äôs my favorite anyway. | Moon the Loon. Mad perfection. | I picked it once and refuse to make that mistake again a second time. | Great choice! I love that song. | Followed by Who Are You | It must be early because I thought there was a cool band I'd never heard of called ""Nobody's said"" | That scream just isn't the same without David Caruso dryly delivering a morbid dad joke first. | Live is so awesome‚Ä¶

https://youtu.be/g1NNw3nachw?si=BZkPplm10NElSPSp | Yes yes yes. | Agree and also wanted to say Oh Baby but turns out it‚Äôs a few seconds short of 6 minutes | I believe in All My Friends supremacy | 45:33 - LCD Soundsytem | I didn‚Äôt even realize this was a 6+ minute song but it‚Äôs a never skip for me | I was going to write this if you didn‚Äôt; this song is such a jam and doesn‚Äôt even feel long | for me, you wanted a hit | This is a good one. Love the initially slow but eventually fast tempo | Yes!!! On a recent wedding RSVP card they asked ‚Äúwhat song will guarantee you get up and dance‚Äù and this was my answer | Their live version of Yeah is 12 minutes and so good | If you can't stand the first half of the song you don't deserve the second half of the song | Great morning drive song¬† | Bwonkkk, bwonk bwenk Bwonkk | The live recording gives me chills | This was my high school newspaper song. We‚Äôd play it every Friday to bring in the weekend, over ten years ago now. Never fails to make me feel all the things somehow | I prefer a live version for the better vocals on the second half. I feel James was a little subdued and experimental on the album version. Also the trio from electric lady of tonight, home, and I want your love blends beautifully into one continuous song. Us v them live is another 6+ banger. Get innocuous too | The muppets version in London is pretty sweet | One of the best album openers of all time. | ‚ÄúMother earth‚Äôs pregnant for the third time‚Ä¶ and yall have knocked her up! I have tasted the maggots in the minds of men, and was not offended. For I knew I had to rise above it all, or drown in my own shit.‚Äù | Probably one of the best guitar solo of Rock history, written by a funk band. What a twist | Good thoughts, bad thoughts is another great song by them. I'll never forget listening to it for the first time and being blown away by the never ending guitar solo and then the lyrics hit and blew my mind even further. May have been some psychedelics involved. | Came here to drop this one. Such a trip | 'I'll Stay' is another amazing 6+ minute song of theirs. | Obligatory Before the Beginning by John Frusciante is a homage to this song and will absolutely send you to the fourth dimension | Holy shit I was just about to comment on this. Such a deep cut! | I also came in to mention some George Clinton bands!


Not Just Knee Deep LP

Atomic Dog LP | yes! without a doubt. plus, the entire album is ‚Äúno skips‚Äùfor me. & the album cover is one of my favs. | Such an epic song. I came to post this, happy more people can appreciate this. | That is one awesome song. | Thank you for typing this so I didn't have to | Was coming here to add this | Few songs can make my heart ache like this one. | Also Maggot Dream by Deth Cube K | Soooooooo good | 100% 
Came here to say the same but realised I‚Äôm
Not special and surely someone has done this before me üòÖ | First time I listened to this high was like a brain massage ü§§ | Love this song | This is the correct answer | I've loved this song and album forever and have only heard people talking about it in the last few years. | Kinda shit little edge lords listen too or trippy hippies. | Fuck I forgot. This song is incredible | This song and Karma Police single-handedly changed my taste in music. | Very surprised I had to scroll this much for this one 

OK computer is just a general masterpiece tbh | I may be paranoid, but not an android. | Was literally going to post this and this is the first comment that showed up. 

Really the entire OK Computer album is worth listening to. | How to Disappear also | I‚Äôm gonna piggyback on here and suggest the 8-minute masterpiece that‚Äôs Bending Hectic by The Smile. Thom York is a genius and a treasure. I highly recommend closing your eyes and wearing good headphones and giving it your complete attention. | It's really well crafted - its format is like a piece of classical music (I can't remember which type in particular - it's been a long time since I had any music lessons). It's a really great song. | First thought in my head too. | Yess thank you! | lol I misread the original post as ‚Äúlove song‚Äù instead of ‚Äúlong song‚Äù and was genuinely puzzled as to how the hell Paranoid Android could be considered a love song | Beat me to it | Noordpool Orchestra covered this entire album with a full jazz orchestra. It's a really interesting take on the music. | Huh. I‚Äôve listened to that song about a million times since OK Computer came out and it never dawned on me that it‚Äôs over six minutes long. | From a Radiohead fan, this is their most overrated song. | reall | Literally, this song plus Karma Police were the beginning to new types of sounds, felt like I was adulting and open to new things | So much this | Off with his head, man | Do yourself a favour and listen to Tripod's cover on YouTube. On par with Radiohead's version. | Tripods https://youtu.be/_xOhTuPTmnI?si=vHwmm1kVDD2iXoNw | This is one of my [Desert Island Discs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Island_Discs) songs for when I inevitably get invited on the show. | Punch brothers version | I really dislike Radiohead. | Unpopular opinion: the Weezer version is also acceptable. | I once heard a story of a radio station DJ who one morning started playing Blinded By The Light (the Manfred Mann version) over and over. People were calling in like crazy; some to see if it was intentional, some to complain, and the best ones were calling in to request it.

This just made me think of that and now I wish I could find the story somewhere, but google is failing me. | This [nearly 20 minute version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTW-9gzbvCQ) which includes interviews with the band on how they made the song is my favourite version.
The bit with Stephen Morris talking about his drum machine, ""Imagine a little fella with 8 arms in there playing all these things, 8 arms he's got, yeah, amazing innit?"", makes me smile every time. | Thank you the wedding singer to introduce me to this gem and on the way to new order and legendary Joy division | The bass bit during the last minute is so good, feels best when you get there patiently from start to end. | Blue Monday is always a yes. | I love that song. It has such an infectious beat! | I love Blue Monday! | You may be interested in a 99% Invisible episode about this song and its physical media | Off topic, but there's a cool version on YouTube by Orkestra Obsolete. It's entirely played with instruments that were available in the very early 20th century, making creative choices for replacing synths and electronic instruments. | Bleak by Opeth | Much as I like Blue Monday, you gotta admit it's a 4 minute song crammed into 7 minutes. | This is a connoisseur‚Äôs choice

I wish I could forget this song so I could hear it again for the first time. I was completely blown away. | That sequence in the Thomas Crowne remake was where I first heard it. | this was the first song I downloaded from limewire when I heard it in Cellular!!! great song!! | This song will ALWAYS remind me of Moriarty's trial in BBC Sherlock

The same way that D√≥nde est√°s Yolanda will always make me think about Sherlock getting decked by John multiple times in various restaurants after faking his death. | Also the felix da housecat remix too | PREACH üôå | An amazing song, Nina Simone, what a voice | I prefer Mississippi Goddam. | I have it saved in my phone library so hear it all the time and NEVER realized how long it was until you mentioned it. I had to go check! | Strong Songs podcast has a great episode unpacking this song | For those who like the marching arts, Mandarins Drum and Bugle Corps performed an amazing show built around this song in 2023.

https://youtu.be/JRkn1MC2FMs?si=VjmYHmr2CS3Hw2D7 | I have 3 studio and 1 live record by Nina Simone. Sinnerman alone is the reason I need one more!

Back to the question:

Many Iron Maiden songsü§ò | Love this one. When I worked at a coffee shop, this was a favorite on the coffee-themed playlist because it sounds like she is singing, *‚ÄúOH, Cinnamon‚Ä¶‚Äù* | This is still on my incredibly outdated MP3 player. | Check out the version Goose does. Incredible | This was an amazing song! | Thank you for this. Holy shit. That was transcendent. Good god | This is one of my top five favorite songs ever | Woah damn....that gave me chills. Thank you. | Riding your co-tail to mention 

The Jackson 5 - I am love | I always almost only see rock on these forums, this is nice | Thanks | Goose covers this, it fucks so hard. Worth a listen. | check out the cover by Goose.

live: 
https://goosetheband.bandcamp.com/album/2024-09-07-spac-saratoga-springs-ny | more like Sinnerman by the Manderins 2023 | Came here to say this! | Wow. Just listened to this. Thank you. | That‚Äôs a great one! I like other versions of that song (like the one the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater uses), but Simone‚Äôs version has an amazing depth and sense of urgency to it. | Heard it on scrubs loved it ever since | In school, our chorus sang a choral version of this song and we won every award. | Didn't even notice this song is so long, even though I listen to it regularly, must be good then. | Yeahhhhhh, so good ü§üüèº | Pretty repetitive actually.  Meh. | Dammit this comment gave me goose bumps. Fine for most people but my arm hair is like 2.5 inches long so I scare people when I get them. | Overrated. But definitely expertly crafted. It‚Äôs pretty similar to a few twenty one pilots songs in terms of how the expertise is applied | Incredibly hard disagree. I'm having a hard time imagining how anyone could possibly think that song should last anywhere as long as it does.

The cut down version used in The Thomas Crown Affair? Fantastic. My family picked up the original on the strength of that alone. Then we played it for the first time...and never again because we couldn't stand it. Bloated, overly indulgent, and should have clocked in at under 4:00. | Jesus of course the top comment would be goatvoice lady i hate reddit | Man. I was at the 2005 Picaresque tour at the Roseland Theater when they performed this live with the giant whale puppets running through the crowd, all of us screaming, swaying with the last three minutes of accordion waltz‚Ä¶the one that was in their documentary. 

I was barely fifteen years old. I saw my teenage self a few times in the crowd in that documentary and had no idea that it was even being filmed that night but holy shit, seeing the pure unbridled joy on my face at that show - only my second unchaperoned show - fifteen years later brought tears to my eyes. 

What a show. It definitely set my precedent for the concert dork I continue to be today.

Thank you for the good memory lane trip, friend. | ‚ÄúBut oh what providence. What divine intelligence
That you should survive as well as me‚Äù

Chills, every.single.time! | Also _The Island: Come And See / The Landlord's Daughter / You'll Not Feel The Drowning_ from _The Crane Wife_. It's a track I never paid much attention to until I saw it live, and it blew me away. | Also the crane wife (1,2&3), if the whole thing counts as one song | Never heard this song before, so thought I'd give it a listen. Wow, what a wild ride start to finish. <3 | Thank you kind redditor for opening my eyes to a band I had never heard of. | Solid choice. I do love that one | Every one of the longer decemberists songs | A Decemberists song without at least 3 deaths is considered a dull affair. | Wow a deep cut, i havent thought of this in years...thanks for the reminder! | Find him, 
bind him
Tie him to a pole 
and break His fingers to splinters
Drag him to a hole
Until he wakes up naked
Clawing at the ceiling of his grave | This is the one I sing hiking when I'm bearanoid. |  The Mariners Revenge Song is a solid choice. The storytelling in it is next level, and I love how it builds up the intensity throughout. Plus, it has that perfect mix of folk and rock vibes that makes it pretty timeless. | That song would make a hell of a movie | came here to say this | Great song! Wish I could find more stuff in the vein of this! | Holy shit, I had never heard this song until recently and had no idea the name nor band. Thank you so much for posting this! | YES! | Holy shit that song is 8 minutes long? I never even noticed | I have listened to this song multiple times a day for YEARS. It's so good. Drove my friends insane. | I would have never guessed to see this song here, especially so high up. | My late partner loved that song! I‚Äôve forgotten all about the decemberists since he passed. Thanks for the reminder to go play some of their songs | I was going to be so upset if someone didn‚Äôt comment this song. The Decemberists are so many other things, but this is their song I always think of first as their crown achievement. | Fantastic song!   See also: The Crane Wife.  I‚Äôll admit that I haven‚Äôt listened to (or thought of) The Decemberists in years.  I‚Äôm going to dig out Picaresque now!  Thanks! | That album is how I got my first ever girlfriend. 

She went to another school, came to a dance with some guy who didn't want to dance and got mad that I asked her to dance and ""refused"" for her. - got her number anyway and she came over the next week to listen and discuss the album on my couch. We were both so awkward but it was fun. | Love the Decembrist‚Äôs grew up wit them | Probably wasn‚Äôt a great song for my dad to show me when I was like 10 but my god if it‚Äôs not a fantastic song. Very jealous my dad‚Äôs seen them live a few times with my brother from his stories of how they perform this with the audience interaction and everything. | Yes!!! Every karaoke night with my friends ends with us all singing this together | Saw them about a month ago, probably one of the best shows I‚Äôve seen in my life.  Honourable mention to Joan in the garden which clocks in at just under 20min, they played that as the encore and it was amazing! | I don't care if I get down voted. Two of my closest friends who are hipsters used to play that song everytime we used to get stoned. It drove me crazy how often they played it. Relentless. I was hoping to forget that song.... | Honestly just name any Pink Floyd song over 7 minutes and you‚Äôre good. All of animals. Welcome to the machine. Echoes. TIME! | I would counter with the Pulse live version being my favourite 

https://youtu.be/vi7cuAjArRs?si=MNa9fwh5TuX5HaAD | Shine on parts 1-5. | Also Shine on you crazy diamond | Shine On You Crazy Diamond was the first thing I thought of. | Try the version from Pulse. The best version I've ever heard. | Yes, it is | I am more like a pulse fan | I adore Comfortably Numb from the PULSE album. | One of the greatest guitar solos. Epic. | Echoes Live at Pompeii. | Was going to say shine on you crazy diamond. Pink Floyd immediately came to my mind! | You just reminded me I need to watch Pompeii again, sheer brilliance. | I especially like the version from the Pulse album, actually! | Came here to say comfortably numb | Cake here to say this | Not 6 minutes, but Majestic by Wax Fang is amazing. Anyone who enjoys Pink Floyd should listen to their album The Astronaut from start to finish.  It's an amazing ride. | Good friend of mine wanted this at his funeral | Good song, but he spells Gilmore weird. | It‚Äôs strange how far I had to scroll to find a Pink Floyd song on the list | I might just cry! üò≠ü§åüôå | Shine on you crazy diamond | Have you heard the version with Van Morrison singing?  Gives me goosebumps every time. For your ear hole pleasure

[https://youtu.be/wpFo_E9Fq2k?si=ABscqc7MpixmtBW5](https://youtu.be/wpFo_E9Fq2k?si=ABscqc7MpixmtBW5) | came here to say this! | Eddie Vedder version is peak | Thought this was Will Smith and Chris Rock? | Yes! | How about the version Dr. Evil sings about Mini Me!? | Gover Washington Jr.- Winelight | Good things might come to those who wait, but not for those who wait too late | Amazing song | Such a beautiful collaboration between two brilliant musicians. | Imma be honest, I enjoy the Joanna Wang version better. (I listened to her version first) | I love that song so much | Ten Years Gone | In my time of dying | When the Levee Breaks is my personal favorite | No Quarter | Absolutely. Led Zeppelin firing at full-power for a nonstop 10 minutes. | Bonham‚Äôs magnum opus | In my time of dying | Check out the live version from 1979 Knebworth

https://youtu.be/HHI4W0umQKs?si=nunC1SbZl1MRAMdt | Bonzo went crazy with that machine gun drumming | Did you see Samus66‚Äôs playing of that song on the YouTube Drumeo channel? Incredible take | FUCK. YES. 

One of Zeps most underrated songs, with about 30 different layered guitar tracks that took me my whole youth to learn. Ridiculously good piece if music, so happy to see it referenced in the wild. Banger and a half, and ill listen to all 10 minutes every time | The title reminds me of Achilles Come Down by Gang of Youths. 7:02 long, and worth every second. | Speaking of Achilles, I'd say Achilles Come Down, by Gang of Youths | Why did I have to scroll so far to find this one. IMO its better than Stairway. Brings me on a different journey each time. | Yes!  I was going to say the same.  I think Presence is a highly underrated album! | There is no shortage of awesome 6+minute Led Zeppelin songs | I had to scroll way too far for this | 5:46 | hell yeah! | It‚Äôs perfection | I came here to comment their Joshua Tree performance but that was not a ‚Äúsong‚Äù it was a timeless moment of emotions (and several songs) | Deeeerrrrooooooooooooop | Had to scroll down till I saw someone mention it | I fucking love this song, gonna spin it tonight and burn that dead wax when I pass out | It's the exact length of a journey I use to do at night and there is something magical listening to that in the dark and feeling like you're being transported to another realm. | See also;

Mirror Reaper - Bell Witch | I was going to post that | Fasten your seatbelt and engage the bong | Proceeds the Weedian; Nazareth | Or almost any Acid King song | This is the answer | Boring af | Man it's amazing how out of its time Knights of Cydonia was. Popular rock was all broody angsty post-grunge BS. Muse's music was moody, but poetically, and Matt Bellamy is a guitar god. The whole band had a level or raw virtuosity you just didn't often see in popular Rock much, and Knights of Cydonia was a rock opera out of the 70s.

I mean where else in the mid-2000's would you hear a rock song with the lines ""Come ride with me, through the veins of history..."", and then have a guy harmonizing on-pitch while he's absolutely shredding guitar. Bellamy PERFORMS with a guitar in a way we hadn't really seen popular acts doing in a long time. when Muse got big in the US.

AND THE DUDE ALSO SINGS LEAD! The thing I love to point out to people is how when the wailing guitar comes in on the second verse of the intro, [Matt Bellamy is VOCALIZING ALONG WITH IT](https://youtu.be/j8WP7aOD_9Q?t=106). I mean that high note, the way it echoes. That's nuts. The man has crazy power in his falsetto. It's way more apparent in live performances. But man the guy goes so hard. Matt Bellamy is that quiet, odd kid with weird hobbies who knows he can absolutely cook on a stage with an axe in his hands.

And you haven't experienced what Live Music is until you've watched Muse do Plug In Baby live in an arena. I'm lucky enough to have seen them twice and it blew me away both times.

Also shout out to Dom Howard and Chris Wolstenholme, who are both equally as good at their instruments as Bellamy, but Bellamy is SUCH a showman that they can go unnoticed. But they've worked together for 25 years now and any time they're in interviews they seem to all be genuinely friends still, and despite having a glam rocker image, Matt Bellamy is super down to earth. He is just somebody who comes alive on stage. | Great running song | Seconded. Fucking love Muse. | And it has the best music video ever made. | One of my all time favourite songs. I class it like bohemian rhapsody. Not that they sound the same, but they‚Äôre both epic long ballads. | Saw them live, this song kicked ass. | Absolutely | That whole album is fantastic, but that song is a masterpiece. And so fun to play on Guitar Hero. | Yes! Some of the live versions can be 8+ mins as well | I wonder how my guitar hero controller survived that - and also my fingertips. | Great song of one of the greatest bands of all time! | At last! Thank you. | REAL | Epic song! | This song is an epic | I was lucky enough to catch this song live when Frank played Jazz Fest like 10 or 11 years ago.  Top tier show wish he would have kept up playing live | Scrolling forever for this. Such a great song. | The comment section appears to be dominated by oldies songs | This is WAY too far down | I was going to say this!! | Man I was searching for this | This is it! üëèüèª | Here it is | Whip ain‚Äôt got no gas tank but it still got wood grain | Song still gives me chills every time I listen to it. God tier. | you the mvp | I have never heard of this person. I looked it up. It is indeed music. Fuck off and listen to the other answers. | Echoes by Pink Floyd | Sheep. That outro makes every second worth it. | Remember when you were young... you shone like the sun | Yes, worth every minute | Dogs - Pink Floyd | Good to see Floyd on top! to add to the list: Cmpfortably Numb, High Hopes, and Coming Back to Life | Dogs. | The live version from Pulse is unreal | Also _Interstellar Overdrive_. London version 16:49 (had to look it up). It's just incredible. | One Of These Days.... | All 9 parts put together. | Also high hopes on TDB. Saw the pink floyd exp at the keswick in PA and the cover of it was phenomenal | From part I to IX straight! | Crazy diamond????!!!! JoJo reference????!!!! | I don‚Äôt see many people appreciating its second part. I love it | Basically all the best Tool songs fit this. I like the absurdly long ones from Fear Inocolum personally. 7empest is a beast. | Personal fave is Parabol/Parabola | Pneuma for me is their masterpiece. It's an absolutely hypnotic, incredible song! | Rosetta Stoned is my personal favorite | Scrolled way too far to see this. Tool army has entered the chat. | Any song by Tool in general | Glad I didn‚Äôt have to scroll far to see this.  My vote would be for Jambi. | Piling on because nobody has mentioned Schism, Wings for Marie, or Vicarious yet! | I came here to say Push It or Third Eye | For your listening pleasure, allow me to present....Rosetta Stoned | That works as well | Fuck yes | Eulogy for me | Rosetta Stoned | Im here for almost their entire discography. They have so many 6+ minute songs that are *chefs kiss* | That and The Pot | This is my fav pick me up song ever | Tool üñ§ | I watched them live in Budapest this year. What a show! | Rosetta Stoned.

The buildup to the moment where the line ""Overwhelmed as one would be..."" starts gives me chills every time. The whole ending is surprisingly emotional. | Can‚Äôt believe I had to scroll this far to find this | D/R/T is where it‚Äôs at for meü§ò | I really assumed this would be TOOL - * for any sign that meets the requirements... Which is quite a lot of them | Oof. Should have checked if someone mentioned Took before I commented. Eulogy is my favorite song. My dad passed when I was 16 and I didn't really have a full understanding of the song then. I referenced it on his actual eulogy that I read. He would have gotten what I meant by it, I don't think anyone else in the church did. Lol | Came here for this!!! | TIL - The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald is over six minutes long.  I like the song, so it never felt like it was long. | I love Edmund Fitzgerald‚Äôs voice. | Hopping on to say, apropos of every time I hear Gordon Lightfoot mentioned, ""If you could Read my Mind"" is the most beautiful song ever written. And I a burly, bearded 45 year old man, tear up and think of my dad, every time it's played. | When the gales of November came early.  What a song. | Excellent, but for my money The Canadian Railroad Trilogy is even better. | I went to the memorial this summer! Beautiful museum! | I came here for this | Check out Tony Rice‚Äôs solo acoustic version. It‚Äôs haunting & still faithful to Gordon‚Äôs original vision. | So many good picks here | I *love* Edmund Fitzgerald‚Äòs voice! | Boy do I have a treat for you...

https://youtu.be/STqY0WxtXQ0 | Did that come before or after Christy moores back home in derry | Six-plus mintues, and consider there's no chorus repeating multiple times during the song. Imagine how much longer it might have been if Lightfoot had added a repetitive chorus. Wise decision, in my opinion, that he didn't. It would have interrupted the narrative ""story-telling"" aspect of the lyrics. Even McLean's American Pie had a chorus. | This is always a hilarious request on karaoke night. I've yet to find a DJ that actually has the song, but they've all appreciated the joke. | Most definitely. Especially if you lived in Southeast Michigan at the time of the sinking. What a powerful, haunting, soul tormenting song. | Lyrics are great, but would it have killed him to write a chorus? Even a bridge, so it's not the same melodic phrase over and over for 6+ minutes?? But I digress. | Yeah that whole album is amazing honestly. Yes is the perfect band. It‚Äôs like they realized they were incredible and decided not to furiously crawl up their own butts and die inside like so many prog bands did | Close to the Edge as well, both the song and album as a whole. | That, or Perpetual Change | To be continued | This song is so stupid good. | Is that a jojo reference | Also, the ladder | The Revealing Science of God by Yes. That one is about 20 minutes long. | I tried out to this song for drill team in 12th grade in 1974.  I made it along with 149 other girls. It is one of my all time favorites. | Give the Allegaeon cover a listen! They do it justice whilst still being original. | My favorite fact about Yes is that the Band still exists, with completely different members than when it started. Then most of the old members and the new members got together in the 90‚Äôs and made a 12 person album called Unity. | Heart of the sunrise, another favorite of mine. | Is that a JoJo reference? | Seen all good people by yes! One of my favorites. | It's cool | Fuckin love this song üò≠üò≠üò≠ | Best trip song, hands down. I have to be ready and make sure no one is around the way I dance furiously to this song. | I loathe the lyrics in that song. Find the singer's voice very jarring. If it was just the music, I'd be happy to listen to it. | Came here to comment this. So glad to see someone beat me to it. | See also: Starship Trooper | Close to the edge is better | Literally one of the best songs ever. | forever grateful to JoJo‚Äôs for showing me this song | To be continued | In and around the lake,

Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there! | Just when you think it's over, there's still a three minute rock solo.

One of the cool things about Roundabout is the variety of instruments and styles all jammed into one song, it's almost like an amalgamation of several different pieces rolled into one. It's like acoustic folk music, elements of a ballad, classic rock, and jazz music all at the same time. | Hundred percent agree with you. I was looking through the comments on this and this song was on the tip of my tongue. That's the one. | One of the greatest bass lines I‚Äôve ever heard | Hmm. I forgot about that one. Adding it to my queue now. | Yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes üôå | Song that made me a fan for life, wish I could hear it again for the first time. | Soulwax remix also goes hard. | 100% | Listened to this for the first time in ages yesterday. Such a great song. | I once had what can only be described as a religious experience when a dj played this on the dance floor. | This song is an absolute masterpiece. It's just beautiful! | I feel like I go into a sort of trance when I listen to this. The beat is a great speed for walking so when I go out and listen to this I wake up 8 minutes from where I started and then play it over and over! | especially on shrooms. | reall | I didn't even realize this song is over 6 minutes long. When I first heard it, I played it on repeat for... longer than I want to admit. | I once had what can only be described as a religious experience when a dj played this on the dance floor. | Song came out right before my dad dropped dead of a heart attack. I never can't cry when I hear it, even now. | I was OBSESSED with Disney's Fantasia as a young kid. All the best pieces were Tchaikovsky. | All of The Nutcracker Suite! | I was just listening to 1812 overture today. It‚Äôs been a long long time favorite of mine | The absolute master of ballet music, hard yes. | *Tchaikovsky no*


***Tchaikovsky yes.*** | I‚Äôll add the ~15 min full version of the 1812 overture to this but like you said, any Tchaikovsky! | My favourite from the entire suite, along with Pas de Deux | Was wondering how far I‚Äôd have to scroll to find Tchaikovsky!! I was going to say 1812 Overture myself, but also the entire Nutcracker Suite is a banger. I have it wallpapered in my office. | I was gonna say Rhapsody in Blue by Gershwin bc I get so into it every time. I love jazzy classical music. | Yes. Serenade for strings in C is my jam.

And Stairway to Heaven.

And Bohemian Rhapsody. | Good one!  I'll borrow your answer... | Agreed | Thank you for this. I just listened to the Royal Philharmonic version and it's amazing. | I got to see it live before the album came out. June 1, 1991 at the Capital Music Center in Grove City, OH. Great show. | I can't believe I had to scroll this far to see this. It's practically one of the greatest rock ballads ever written. | I‚Äôm not even a big GnR fan and this one was the first that came to mind. | Amazing video as well. | I saw him do this live 2 years ago and it was twice as long and still worth every minute | The world famous ALBUQUERQUE HOLIDAY INN! Where the towels are oh so fluffy! | A person with refined tastes. I was hoping someone would post this and I was not disappointed, thank you fellow Weird Al fan. | Don‚Äôt forget The Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota! | Seeing Albuquerque live, having him 'lose his place' halfway through and go back to the beginning, and adding a few minutes extra of him naming different kinds of doughnuts... That was a core memory for me.

""You got any......... Huckleberry doughnuts? You got any............... Halle Berry doughnuts? You got anyyyyy....... Chuck Berry doughnuts?""

He also stopped before he got to the line that goes ""It's some big fat hermaphrodite with a Flock-Of-Seagulls haircut and only one nostril"" and he went: ""Listen. When I wrote this song, it was a different time and I don't agree with this lyric now, I'm sorry in advance"". | That snorkel's been just like a snorkel to me! | Yes, so worth it | I came here armed with a list of pretentious prog and art rock masterpieces, ready to absolutely own this thread. Things like in A Gadda Da Vida, The Grudge, L'Via L'Viaquez, half a dozen Pink Floyd songs, some early King Crimson, even a few Meatloaf classics.  

None of them hold a candle to Albuquerque. Not even close. It's the Mona Lisa of modern music. | anyone on the street will gladly shave your back for a nickel | Wacka wacka doodoo, yeah! | I found my people | Uh, YES | She tied me to a chair and stuck a funnel in my mouth and force fed me sourkraut until I was 23 and a half years old! | Wow surprised how high this song was. Not because it doesn't deserve it but I didn't think it was that well known. Over at r/weirldal the question of his best long songs does come up from time to time and this, Genius in France and especially Biggest Ball of Twin in Minnesota come up a lot. It's amazing that the artist (R Wappin) behind the fan animated music video for Albuquerque from over 10 years ago got to be one of the contributors to the most recent official music video for Al's new polka. | I have a root beer scented candle. It fills the room with the scent of Albuquerque. | Trapped in the Drive Thru is one of the most incredible songs ever written too! | What a great answer. The amount of processing power this song takes for the brain is hilarious | My husband and I played this for a friend once. He thought it was the dumbest thing he had ever heard and was pissed that we ‚Äúwasted‚Äù his time lol | YESSSS | Also stuck in the drive thru | do you have any jelly rolls? | Lol I just commented this. Shoulda known it would already be here at least once üòÅ | Dicks automotive is super good and is the song this one is based on. | ‚ÄúAnesthetize‚Äù is always my go-to on these types of questions. I used to have a motto that if something took longer than the length of that song to do, it wasn‚Äôt worth doing. | Almost everything Porcupine Tree to be honest. | I'd ad Anesthetize as well. | Absolutely this!! Seen it live twice and it's a magnificent piece of work. For all their joking about being lazy and sloppy live etc etc it's so damn good, and just as relevant today as when it came out 24 years ago. | I put this on when I'm running and I think I've only got one song left in my legs | Obligatory ""scrolled way too far to see this...""

I bought the weird half-clear CD as a high school sophomore, with the kid holding an airplane on the front cover and filled with 18 minutes of biting, subversive anti-capitalist anti-military social commentary, at a time when newly-agglomerated radio stations were censoring any songs with the word ""airplane"" from the airwaves while beating the drums for global war.

It took about 30 seconds to hook me and it hasn't really let me go in the 20-something years since. Holy shit, what a fuckin' song! | Came here to say this. Glad you did. | Finally saw them play this live last month and it was one of the best moments (18+ minutes I guess) of my life | The cover of The Decline was my first (poorly executed) tattoo | And possibly the band with the longest song title
We through gasoline on the fire and now we have stumps for arms and no eyebrows | Yes, this song! I kept scrolling, I knew this song would make the list. I know what I‚Äôm listening to in my way to work this morning. | Isn‚Äôt it like 19 minutes? | I can‚Äôt stop loving this. | masterpiece | It's a great song/album. I saw it live a couple times too. 

NoFX (and Me First and the Gimme Gimmes) are pretty damn good performers. | Dang it.  I was hoping to be the first to mention the decline.  Maybe I‚Äôll the first for Alice‚Äôs restaurant? | Can't believe I had to go this far down. They used to play a few minutes of this at a time at shows. I have seen it almost in its entirety through like 6 or 7 shows. | [‚ÄúThe Decline Live at Red Rocks w/Baz‚Äôs Orchestra‚Äù](https://youtu.be/oWhy8PCuGsk) is a masterpiece.

>!‚ÄùDO BAD RELIGION HAVE A FUCKING BASSOON?‚Äù!< | Saw this live in Charlotte like 10 or so years ago | It‚Äôs an amazing masterpiece, but not a love song. | Can't believe I had to scroll this far down | Yeah boiiiii | How is this not the top comment. That songs has given me chills and tears and does so almost every time I give it a focused listen. | I wrote it, scrolled down and instantly found your comment. What a marvelous piece of music | Always loved this song but last year I saw Eric Prydz close his set in H√Ø Ibiza with this and ever since then it hits so different | Yes. Also reminded me :

Faithless - Insomnia
Marek Hammen - Gemini | Anytime I would get flack from people for listening to deadmau5, this was always my response. 

The 16th Hour, followed by Strobe, is 20 minutes, and it is phenomenol. | I was going to say it if nobody else did. | Best EDM song of all time | First time I heard this song was also the first time I tried weed back in my early 20‚Äôs. Holy shit did I feel it. I still love it. The song. Weed not so much these days, it makes me paranoid. | You beat me to it - this was mine as well. | My first thought, and I haven't heard it in many years.  It immediately popped into my head when I saw this post. | Had to scroll for a bit but this is the only correct answer tysm | This song immediately makes me feel like a teenager again and I love it. | Yes! | Needs more upvotes! | Yes! Best song! | Scrolled just to find this one. Seeing them Friday!!!! | Came here to say this. My long time favorite long song. | Oh man.. old gold <3 | üíØ the correct answer | I learned to play this on the piano many years ago.  such great memories attached to this song! | I always forget that song is almost 9 minutes it feels like it's only 5 min for me | Here mainly for this one | Yep. Everyone knows all the words and how to wave up arms in homage to The Purple One. | DJ at a friend's wedding played this as the last song, but had it remixed to be about 30 minutes long. By the end half of the company was singing along drunkenly and way too loud and the other half was on the floor roaring with laughter. I'll never forget this | Honorary mention: Adore | The Rain Formerly Known As Purple | He has many songs over six minutes that are gems | See also: November Rain. | I had to scroll way too far to find the objectively current answer | La Villa Strangiato is a masterpiece. | Rush=upvote | For another great prog song and a Rush connection, Porcupine Tree‚Äôs ‚ÄúAnesthetize‚Äù. Alex Lifeson plays the solo on it, as well. | Excellent choice! | I just listened to Red Barchetta yesterday and made not that it was over six minutes. So I‚Äôm adding that as well | Bam bam! | Chef‚Äôs Kiss | My only complaint about that song Is that they just barely missed out on the opportunity to make it 21 minutes and 12 seconds long. Otherwise, an amazing song. | I thought about submitting this, along with Shine On You Crazy Diamond, but they are broken into ‚Äòmovements‚Äô so it felt like cheating. So much of The Who is the same. | I scrolled too far to find this | Can't believe none has said this earlier....I guess this is too obvious for everyone. | Kashmir and when the levee breaks too | I had to scroll way too far to see this comment | My favorite version of this song, goosebumps every time

https://youtu.be/2cZ_EFAmj08?si=Na2Xkgxw_nWy7X5D | No stairway, denied! | Can't believe I had to scroll down this much to find this anwser | It is overplayed and cliche, but it truly is a great song. | It's ""Orion"" for me but that whole album is a home run. | Sweet! I'm still scrolling down for One... unbelievable... | That whole album is a banger. | Many great suggestions. This is the correct answer | Also One | The ‚ÄúS&M‚Äù album versions (either one or two!) are amazing, but the original S&M is what got me into Metallica. | This one was way too far down the list | Finally see it | The Unforgiven II as well. | Great song | So many Metallica songs fit this description. I'd throw in ""The Day that Never Comes"" | That's my favorite Metallica song and I didn't even think of giving this for an answer. I said Acid Bath instead üòÇ | Rhyme of the ancient Mariner is pretty sweet too | Maiden's half discography are long songs that are worth every minute. | *Phantom of the Opera* takes the cake for me. | Alexander the great | Empire of the Clouds...Paschendale...Thin Line...just Maiden in general ü§òüèªü§òüèªü§òüèª | In honesty, Iron Maiden could fill the list just by themselves.

As you said, Hallowed be thy Name and Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner as Random_Smellmen added.

Also have to throw The Talisman, Empire of the Clouds, When the Wild Wind Blows, The Red and the Black, and pretty much the entirety of the Senjutsu album (but especially Senjutsu, The Writing on the Wall and Hell on Earth).

They have definitely gotten more epic with their releases over the years. | Their current tour is mainly long songs, and it just flies by. | Never knew or felt that it was that long! | Cradle of Filth did a great cover. | I'll see you here and raise you Dance of Death. I *appreciate and respect* Iron Maiden more than I necessarily *love listening to them,* but this one's in pretty regular rotation for me. Wasted Years, too. | For newer Maiden, I thought When the Wild Wind Blows was fantastic as well. | First time I heard it it was the live rio version. I'm from Canada. I was 15 and being driven to the bar going crazy fast on the autobahn. It was sweet. | Great song! But In my opinion, Machinehead perfected It. | Honestly Layla should be a lot shorter. Look me in the eye and tell me you don‚Äôt skip the 4 minute piano outro 90% of the time | Or every thanksgiving‚Ä¶. | Dammit. I forgot how much fun that song is. 

I literally just read your comment and did the EXACT same thing I did the first time I went to listen to it 3 or 4 years ago.

Open song. ""18 minutes?! No way in hell I'm listening to all this!""

8 minutes in - tapping toe, bobbing head side to side, grinning and laughing.

17 minutes in - full voice, singing along, smiling ear to ear. | Lol I was just telling one of my friends it's gonna be in season again | You can get anything you want at Alice‚Äôs Restaurant (exceptin‚Äô Alice) | That song almost caused a car accident. I have no idea why the radio station I was listening to played it (must have been Thanksgiving) but it was the first time I heard it. 

I was laughing so hard I almost rear-ended the car in front of me. | I don't know what you're talking about I could listen to this daily | I listen to this on repeat while prepping and cooking Thanksgiving dinner. It's usually turns out as a Thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat. | I once did a day‚Äôs worth of extemp speeches in the style of this song at a forensics tournament and made semifinals. Someone even handed me a 1 and 25. | Forgotten that one, brilliant storytelling! | Someone at the bar I work at has taken a liking to this recently... 4 times a night... | I‚Äôm so glad this is on here | I‚Äôm so glad someone else said this one! My dad‚Äôs Thanksgiving tradition. He passed away a few years ago and I put it on in his honor every year. | Radio stations shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to go to Xmas format until after playing Alice‚Äôs Restaurant on Thanksgiving. | I was looking for a bite to eat while visiting the Berkshires.  Stumbled upon this hole in the wall place.   Girlfriend hated it, but I was hungry.  While waiting at the table I'm looking around, and I saw it's named Alice restaurant, I was like, cool, I know a song like that.   I keep looking around and I'll be damned, it's that Alice's restaurant!!   Pretty cool. | 7:45 and he says, ""But that's what I came to tell you about....""

WHAT???! | This should be higher on the list. Definitely worth every minute. Que it up every time a new guest arrives. ü¶É | I hate that song, but only because I think Arlo is a twat. | Paradise by the dashboard light also | *I Would Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)* | Traffic the low spark of high heeled boys as well. | Had to scroll too damn far to find meatloaf | Can't believe it took this far to find Bat out of Hell.

It's an unequaled rock anthem. Completely singular in how hard it goes. | Dear Mr Fantasy is really good! | What about the Low Spark of High Heeled Boys? | If Meat Loaf, then I‚Äôd say ‚ÄûGoing All The Way‚Äú | Light of Day by SW is a banger. Great driving music too | If Meat Loaf, then I‚Äôd say ‚ÄûGoing All The Way‚Äú | Steve Winwoods band after he left the Spencer Davis group and before he went solo. Excellent song. | I‚Äôm always torn between A Light in the Black and Stargazer. Bloody hell the whole band were at the top of their game. | Greatest album title drop ever


""There's no sound as he falls‚Äîinstead of RISING!!"" | Stargazer is best fantasy book/movie that is just few minutes long and not book or movie at all. | If it is by Dio-era Rainbow and over six minutes, it is a valid reply to this question. | Everything over 6 minutes from Rainbow tbh, but yeah, Stargazer is top | Both of those are top notch. Kudos my friend. | Don't forget, Catch The Rainbow by Rainbow | Rainbow Eyes by Rainbow. The outro is pure heaven | Wait a second, this sounds like rock and/or roll! | [In The Garden of Eden](https://www.thisdayinmusic.com/classic-albums/iron-butterfly-in-a-gadda-da-vida/), baby! | My local rock and roll station plays the full version on New Year's at midnight. It's rad every damn time. | As a former radio person I love the song and loved that it gave me time to run to the bathroom. | Was expecting The Simpsons link | If a bar has TouchTunes, you can remotely play this and let the patrons bask in the organ solo. | I actually saw them live in 1969 and they were AWESOME!  We weren‚Äôt even stoned (young and poor) and that song sounded perfect. | You beat me to it!  lol | Word has it FM DJs of the 70s loved this song. They could put it on, hit the bathroom, grab some coffee, make a run to the corner deli and get back just a it finished up. | I. Ron Butterfly | I‚Äôve never heard this before. Thanks for the treat. | I had to scroll WAY to far for this. That's the song that started my love for the long songs!!! Rock station that we rarely listened to when I was a child in the 80's(mom usually played the pop/alternative station) played it when dad and I were running errands. I think he knew what was coming cause he turned it up a bit even. My 7-10 year old ears were forever altered!!! | I kept scrolling to see if someone mentioned this! Always have to listen to the whole track, so good | I think the drum solo alone is 6+ minutes | Been waiting for this one! | Tried requesting it but radio stations said it was too long. | I was scrolling all the way down to find out, if someone already mentioned that one.
Even though it's quite a commitment in terms of length | Semi related fun fact: the song was used in the Criminal Minds episode The Tribe | I kept scrolling.  And scrolling.  And found my people!  ‚òÆÔ∏è | How many of us were conceived under such circumstances? | My DJ friend said he'd play this when he needed to take a dump.  And get some dinner.  And smoke a bowl. | Was gonna say Telegraph Road. But half of Dire Straits‚Äô discography, honestly. | The version of this song in [*Alchemy: Dire Straits Live*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy:_Dire_Straits_Live) is almost 11 minutes long, and worth every second. All of the other non-live versions are less than 6 minutes. | Specifically, or especially, the Alchemy Live version.

edit: If I could go back in time and visit one live, it'd be either that or Queen Montreal 1981. | Especially the Alchemy Live version. | Give the 1983 'live at the Hammersmith Odeon' version a listen. It blows the album version out of the water for me. | Wait, it's 6mins+? | Love that song. Is Brothers in Arms 6+ mins? If so, that also. | This is my top five favourite songs of all time. | I didn't think that song was over 6 minutes long

I just checked, it's 11 seconds short of 6 minutes which is still about 2 minutes longer than I thought it was | Every single time I listen to this song I‚Äôm just amazed by how great it is | Followed by Homecoming. Then you have the two longest Green Day songs back to back. | Excellent choice! The American idiot album/story holds up so well. I wish I'd seen the play version | I used to watch the video multiple times a day‚Ä¶fuckin love Green Day! | Came here to say this, can't believe it's not higher up | Just saw them live and was so amped to see them perform the entire American idiot album. Homecoming is also epic | I'm sad I had to scroll this far for this answer. | How on earth did I have to scroll that far to find this mentioned | There it is üëè | Here it is. | yep | Don‚Äôt mean to be annoying but wasn‚Äôt that 5 separate songs tacked together? Been a long time since I listened mind you. | The emotional roller coaster, tempo and energy changes always have this song as a banger even if most other Green Day kinda fell off | I like Passion Play too  :) | [All 47 ](https://youtu.be/ldXdnZtTWp8?si=RVpCMK2Fi6t6ZYe_)   [minutes of it.  ](https://youtu.be/GTWQv8RsI6s?si=-oQzgfHqrxL8c8aY)




Eta: thank you Uncle Matt, for the deep dive on Jethro Tull. | Bless you for posting this | and your wise men don't know how it feeEeeeEEeeels | Both parts!!! | Lover, You Should‚Äôve Come Over too!! | You pick a phrase, you pick a rhyme, 

repeat the sound another time, 

five iambs, then an extra beat will do ya.

Another rhyme, a rising note;

Congratulations, you just wrote 

*another goddamn verse to Hallelujah* | I like Rufus Wainright's version. | This is one of the few examples of the cover being better than the original. | I never can get enough of that one. | Anything Michael Oldfield....so great | The best 48 minute song ever made | Each part is approximately as long as a pomodoro timer, for any productivity nerds who want 25ish minutes to get shit done. 

Also, when I was a kid, we were asked to do a presentation on a song we liked for class. I chose Tubular Bells, not knowing we would have to play the whole thing while standing at the front before explaining it. Everyone else chose 3 minute pop songs of the day. I took my time üòÖ | Spooky | I listen to this so often. Sublime. | This is way too far down the thread. My dad had this on 8 track and we used to listen to it on long trips, along with all the other 8 tracks. | This,, I had to go a long way to see this | good call on Kashmir, forgot about the length of the track. | I was starting to loose my shit not seeing Hurricane on the list. | Can't believe I had to scroll this far to find Kashmir | I love the way Hurricane flows. | Clicking this post, I expected Hurricane to be the top answer no question. | Pigs is great | The whole Physical Graffiti album is great   Ten Years Gone is one of my favorite Led Zeppelin songs, and it also fits the category. | ""You radiate cold shafts of broken glass"" is just a phenomenal lyric | This was my choice!  It was the very first song that came to mind when I saw this.  I scrolled for a very long time to see if I could back someone who put this song up. | If going for a DCFC song I‚Äôd think of Transatlanticism first. | Forgot about this song, what a tune! | Finally! I got worried this wasn't on the list. üíô Such a beautiful song. | ‚ÄúDazed and Confused,‚Äù too. It‚Äôs Zeppelin in the 60‚Äôs. | Not me saving this to test later‚Ä¶ | Yeah. same for me | Achilles Last Stand is also another great answer and a song that doesn't get nearly enough attention. | Right at about 6:05 when he utilizes the double guitar | Can't believe this doesn't have more (all the) up votes. | I shouldn't have had to scroll so far for this | 'Since I've been loving you' also hits, every time | Amazing! | How? | Depends, if you use nr. 5 whole grain spaghetti it comes out too much al dente. | üëâ No Stairway! | This is the most correct answer. | I can't believe I had to scroll this far down. | im... im about to try something out now | The only thing its good for. | 4 minutes of nodding around and jerking off followed by 1 minute of undeniable absolute brilliance and then another minute of garbage. In all honesty the song should be less than 2 minutes long | Ahhh so many great long tracks on that album (and the other UYI). Civil War, Breakdown, Estranged, Locomotive‚Ä¶ | Estranged as well | I scrolled way too far to see this | Absolutely!!!! This song is an absolute masterpiece. | Needs more votes.  Peak GnR | Don‚Äôt forget Don‚Äôt Cry along with the alternate lyrics version. | My first thought!! | AYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEE MAH MAN | When I was in 6th grade (the year Use Your Illusion I came out), we had a class poll about everyone‚Äôs favorite song and like 90% of the class said November Rain. | I had to check that it was actually over 6 min, feels like 3 or 4 | The guitar solos add to the length, but the song IS the guitar solo, everything else is just padding. | Billy Joel is a treasure. | It's fun to hear how it was made up of like [3 different songs](https://youtu.be/fer3P8rbxZg) | This is what I was looking for! This song is perfect to me.¬† | When i die I'm gunna be in hell with Marquee Moon playing on loop. Working retail they had the song on one of the cds that would play over the PA and it feels like it's 30 minutes long, and it fakes an ending about halfway thru. It also didn't help that PA speakers have no high or low, i didn't even know the song had words for years. | Wait!

Where's Sister Ray?!? | Well, you have good taste. | Sister Ray, too. | That, or Cowgirl in the Sand or Down by the River. 

Neil had some absolute bangers in his early years that were nearly 10 minutes.  To say nothing of On the Beach and Ambulance Blues, which meet the definition of this question, and allow me to expound on the most underrated Neil album, IMO | Totally agree | You should hear it when Warren gets hold of it | Built to Spill does a good cover of this! | Dave Rawlings does a good cover too | There it is | My favorite Neil Young song! | Particularly the live at Wakken 2013 version. | I prefer ""Greatest Show in Earth"" but Ghost Love Score is also excellent¬† | I would say that symphonic metal is one of the easier metal subgenres to get into. It's usually not too heavy and has beautiful melodies/orchestral bits for people who are not used to the aggressiveness of some band music. | Nightwish! Good choice :) | Beauty of the Beast is my favorite. It‚Äôs a shame we‚Äôll probably never hear it live again. | The Poet and the Pendulum. But Ghost Love Score has the better live performance. | Was never into metal‚Ä¶ but Floor ü§© | I scrolled and scrolled and I finally found you. | I always think of YTMND when I hear that, due to the ‚Äúepic‚Äù bit | I would say Theatre of Dimensions is the best long song in that genre but it's a bit... weirder. | Why is this so far down on the list?  This was the stop every time it's on the radio and sing along song during the '70s.  I love me some Bohemian.  But American Pie came first. | This but also Weird Al's Star Wars ""The Saga Begins"" parody of it.. except that one is slightly shorter at 5:27. | I was just about to say this one! I have a weird history with this song - I didn't grow up hearing it, I heard it for the first time as an adult a few years back playing Rock Band with some new friends. And maybe a year back now, somehow having forgotten about it... I dream about it. Real briefly, I vaguely remember somebody playing the piano to it in a collapsed house.

When I woke up, I looked up the song again and now I almost always listen to it all the way through. Good memory of meeting my friends, strange memory of that dream. | I came here to say this if it wasn't already said and I'm so glad it's already on the list. I used to swim distance races in high school and I would always hum/sing this song in my head while I was doing the races. Thank you Don McLean. | Man this song holds so many good memories for me.

When my sister and I were kids, my mom loved this song, and we did too. If we were pulling into the driveway and it came on, my mom would pull back out and drive laps around the neighborhood until it ended just to hear the entire thing. She said it was because ""you never get lucky enough to catch it from the beginning"". 

Which would be believable if this hadn't happened at least 10 or 15 separate times. | Yeah this is the song that was so worth it radio had to play it and it‚Äôs still my kids favourites in 2024 | perfection | My hot take: it would've been better if it were a little shorter and ended on the final ""day the music died."" The chorus is cool but we've already heard it five times by then; it didn't need to be repeated, let alone twice. | I almost forget how long this song is | Because you are getting old. I‚Äôm still scrolling to find Hey Jude and Papa was a rolling stone. | Haha oh no. You‚Äôve just unlocked an embarrassing memory for me that I had totally forgotten. At my 8th birthday party I told my parents my only request was that I wanted ‚ÄúAmerican pie‚Äù to play the whole time. So we had 10 or so of my classmates come to our house for presents, games, pizza, and cake. And my dad put the song on repeat and it played for the whole maybe 3-4 hour party. And I would sporadically sing along. | Telegraph Road | Thank GOD someone else mentioned Iron Maiden ü§òüèª | came way too far to see hey jude | Rime is underated. | Shooting Star, good one! | Last Chance - Shooting StarüòÅ | I like that video of someone yelling free bird at a band and the lead singer yelling back


""REALLY!? ITS A FUCKING 8 MINUTE SONG!! I'LL FUCKING PLAY IT, BUT YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND, ITS A FUCKING 8 MINUTE SONG!""


then they play it¬† | Local bar hired a band one time. Towards the end of the show someone shouted Freebird. Lead nods to his band mates and announced into the mic that this will be their last song of the night. While they take a moment to prep someone comes up and talks to the lead. The lead then announced into the mic, ""Manager wanted to remind us that we're on for 30 more minutes. Once again, this will be our last song of the night."" And they then busted into 28 minutes of Freebird and rocked every moment of it. | Especially while driving | How is this so low‚Ä¶ | This was my first thought can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs not higher up | Everytime! | I will never be able to not associate Free Bird with The Devil's Rejects lol | I was looking for this comment. | Most definitely!¬† | I was gonna say that! | My dad plays it every New Year's Eve at midnight LOL. | This is the only answer | This needs to be higher! | How is this not the top answer | Tack on Tuesdays Gone and Simple Man on this.  Both great songs as well. | This song is so repetitive.  It‚Äôs the same thing over and over with a bit more energy each time, and then they couldn‚Äôt figure out how to end it so they just fade out.  It could have been a radio edit or an hour long and the song wouldn‚Äôt be any different. | I'm disappointed I had to scroll so far to find this. For me, the song of theirs that I can never stop myself from getting swept away in is Festival. | Omg Se Lest!! And Staralfur | Samskeyti gets me every time. | Untitled no8 | > I Feel Love, Donna Summer (original 12"" version)

Hijacking this to also recommend *The Number One Song in Heaven* (long version) by Sparks (also featuring Moroder) | I scrolled WAY too far down to find this | Also March of the Black Queen | Bohemian Rhapsody is 5:55 minutes long and NOT 6+ minutes long as OP quite clearly specified. | Why did you respond like ChatGPT | I absolutely love Mike Myers playing the producer who yells at them that no one will ever listen to a 6 minute rock opera.

Didn't see don mcleans American Pie anywhere..

I'm gonna go ahead and mention Taylor's 10 minutes all too well. | üëÜüëÜüëÜ | Bohemian rhapsody is perfect but imo no song can beat innuendo | Why did I have to scroll so far down for this! üò≠üò≠ | Xanadu the dnb artist? | xanadu is something else | Blackstar really was the perfect goodbye. I still cry when I listen to it sometimes. | Paradise by the Dashboard Light | Can't believe I had to scroll this far down to find it. Apparently Steinman cried when they record company told him to cut it down because the radio stations would not play 13 minute songs | love that whole album and several long ones on there | Came here to say anything off this album | I belt this out on my tedious drive home daily. I suck at doing so, but it helps to pass the time. | Meatloaf fuckin sucks | Upvote for Coheed and Cambria! They have so many other incredible 6+ minute songs as well. | OKAY the same deep water as you does NOT play around !!!!!!!!!! | The Cure is *SO* good at making 6+ minute songs that really deserve to be 6+ minutes. They way they layer and build instrumentation, or tell a story that evolves as the song goes on.

I wanted to list something from The Cure, but I couldn't pick just one song. 

Bare from Wild Mood Swings

Apart and From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea, both from Wish

And as you said, pretty much everything from Disintegration | Don't forget The Cure's Mixed Up has a lot of classics that are expanded. | Oooh that is my fave Coheed track and it sounds new every time I give it a spin. So much going on and such a disarming mix of simple, complex, quiet, loud and louder. | I just saw Coheed last week as the ‚Äúopener‚Äù for Incubus and holy shit these dudes are criminally underrated. It was like two concerts in one. I was in heaven. | I commented IKSSE too! | The cure is chill üòé I suggest you listen to Hi Ren by Ren, another British artist with storytelling lyrics, good instrumentals and Ren does a lot of different genres to suit everyone's tastes. | A person with refined tastes. I was hoping someone would post this and I was not disappointed, thank you fellow Weird Al fan. | Totally was looking through this whole post for it and wish it was close to the top! | Also Save Me | Boom, came here to say this | Also When the Music's Over and Riders on the Storm | ""I want to... KILLLL YOUUUU!"" | This is the answer I was looking for. Unquestionably Jim Douglas Morrison 'The Lizard King' was a poet. | I don't like many doors songs but imma go with Soft parade as another long one that rocks | Live at the Hollywood Bowl is my personal favorite. | Yes yes | I was going to say any song on Animals in general. | Favorite PF song. | Stone | you‚Äôve gotta be crazy!!

you‚Äôve gotta have a real need | Tunnel of Love for me, might be the most perfect rock song ever written. And that outro solo is some of Mark Knopfler's best work, which is saying something. | Romeo and Juliet just makes in over the target at 6:01. | Every time I listen to the Love Over Gold album version I think 'Was that 14m20s already' | This itself is a shortened version of song from the Alchemy live album, as it chops a good minute from the end. If it's worth every minute, we might as well enjoy the full length version. | Mark Knopfler is a god among boys. | First CD I ever owned. Mind you, in those days, if you bought a CD player and *didn‚Äôt* get a copy of Money For Nothing and/or Brothers In Arms, they wouldn‚Äôt let you leave the store with it. | Hell to the yeah | Came here to say this | This is the one, right here. | Underrated band | I saw them perform the whole song as the encore when I saw them live in 2009, so awesome! | Yep second vote for this. It‚Äôs such a good song. | yes!!! | the world does not get enough Snow Patrol. I‚Äôm not even in their cohort so to speak, they‚Äôre at least twenty years after my peak music cycle but everything I‚Äôve heard of theirs is just fantastic. | Scrolled really far to find this one. Seconded | Finally! This is the song I wanted to say as well, and there many great prog epics out there that are equally good.

Most of DT's (and prog) songs fit into this question though. | Also like Octavarium 17 plus minutes | Thank you! 7-minute long songs are barely considered long. Give me the half hour epic ballad of a man's entire life complete with random ""Dead Poets Society"" quotes in the middle! | Oh shit, you are a G. I love Goodbye Sky harbor. | Shit. I was not expecting someone to actually post this. This song helped me get through a lot in my life. | Fave song of all time! | Great pick! | Whoa, there's a song I haven't thought of in a few decades! | One night about 15 years ago I was driving home when Green Grass and High Tides came on the radio. Instead of making the turn to my apartment, I kept driving and cranked up the volume. Love that song. | This song is a deep south dream sequence. | Was looking for this one! | Can‚Äôt believe I had to scroll so far for this! Love that song | Sadly, Bohemian Rhapsody clocks in at 5:55. | yep. with most other songs, i've tuned them out after a while. but with bohemian rhapsody, i'm there in the zone, vibing from start to end. | First song that came to mind. What you have to remember is that, even though it doesn‚Äôt clock the six minute mark, it *doesn‚Äôt use a single refrain*. You add one repeated line, and you‚Äôre well into six minutes. What an artistic masterpiece | Had to scroll too far for that, who cares it‚Äôs 5 seconds short to be 6+ minutes. You can easily add 5 seconds to any or each of the 6 parts of the song and it will not loose anything. | Listen to the entire night at the opera album. It's so good. No duds | That song is exactly worth the hype it gets | Innuendo is also good | It's so good I always forget it's this long. | Yeah but it's so novelty now. It's almost just a joke anthem now. | I feel like this one and Prophet Song go hand in hand! They're both amazing. | I was going to out this, but it's only 5:54! Otherwise it's 100% the right answer. | How is this not higher?! It‚Äôs a million songs in one! | 5:55 | I turn it off as soon as it comes on these days. It's over played and over-rated for prog rock. | A great song, but ‚Äòonly‚Äô 5:55 minutes long,  not 6+ ü•≤ | It‚Äôs so cliche and so overused that I don‚Äôt prefer to listen to it very often, but there‚Äôs a good reason it‚Äôs a classic. It‚Äôs a work of art. | was looking for this comment, if I hadn't found it, would've commented it. BANGER | Also Euphoria because I am a generational hater | Best song of all time | so hop in that water, and pray that it works... | Buckethead is so good. He actually got me into listening to instrumentals to the point I had a whole playlist of amazing background music. | Ill listen to any ep he released between 2005-2015, most them are longer than 6mins | There is no buckethead song not worth listening, but most of them are longer than 6 mins anyway | I had to check how long it was, because it has never felt that long to me. Such a beautiful song, I wish we had more of his music. | >One bourbon, one scotch, one beer

The only karaoke song I've ever sang and it's perfect because EVERYBODY will sing with you, no matter how bad you might be.

COME DOWN HERE | Chocolate Rain

Tay Zonday | Only the greatest song ever | Yes. Underrated masterpiece. | Niiiiice. Peter Steele at his finest. R.i.P.

Entirely crude and unnecessary comment, but I always wondered how much pussy that dude got in his prime. | I was looking for a type o song! Was going to say Bloody Kisses myself but there's so many to choose from. | Oooh, absolutely. | Oooo yes! | Thank you. I can stop scrolling now. I was expecting this to be ranked near the top. | Such a great version! | Do You Feel Like We Do 

But yes, maybe the greatest rock song ever created. | Oddly enough, the best version of this song might be the live Midnight Special performance where they had to speed it up because they were running out of time...

https://youtu.be/GyxSvZOby54?si=ZdMC89qtVP3R_B9O | Fun song, but I always liked Moving Waves better.  No yodeling. | I only opened this thread to see if someone mentioned this song! Love it¬† | These were going to be my answers too! | Throw in Hurricane and Black Diamond Bay and you've really got some good storytelling going on. | Had to scroll way too far down for this one. It's so beautiful. 
Haven't seen my other favorite yet, same genre, darker vibe: A Three-Legged Workhorse by This Will Destroy You. Chills all day. 

Also haven't seen Opeth mentioned yet so special shoutout, especially to To Bid You Farewell and Burden. All the feels! Oooh, and Feather by Devin Townsend. Okay, I have like 237 more suggestions and have actual stuff to do so I'm just gonna stop now. :') | They have so many good slow burns! | Was gonna say Terrapin Station but this is a very good choice | So glad to see this here, of all the suite style songs they've created this one encapsulates so much in one place. Out of all of them it feels the most like a story to me. Will never forget flying down a highway out on eastern long island taking in the flat land and the death of summer for that year. That whole album is a masterpiece. | 11/21/73 is my all time favorite. 11/11/73 is #2 | Wharf Rat | Not a Dead fan.  How about A Remark You Made (6:56) by Weather Report? | Or really almost anything from them. | Tahoe tweezer also comes to mind | Denver ‚Äò97 Ghost | Finally, I've found my people | song is somehow relentless, like rising floodwater | Hauntingly beautiful | Came here to say this. Arguably the best song of the 90s behind Smashing Pumpkins Mayonaise. | He'll yea. I fucking love Weezer and that's a great song | Great choice | First found this song on a cowboy bebop AMV. ‚ù§Ô∏è | That first and The Greatest Man That Ever Lived second. | THERE it is. Thank god I found this comment. I was rage-scrolling trying to find someone like-minded before suggesting this song myself. Absolute banger. Crazy that the Blue Album turned 30 this year........!!! | It really is a masterpiece! | Fuck yes! | I just put it on repeat 3x - or more üòä | So many Rush songs...very few are under 6 minutes, haha | Why did I have to scroll so far to find KGLW? | I‚Äôd add Magma to the list, too. It was incredible hearing it live recently. | Oh God yes! Iron Lung is a pinnacle of modern music, pure sex in form of sound. | And A&W | dope song | Took way to long to find this. The Seconds Out version is just exceptional. Slowing down Eggs is Eggs at the end is Eggceptional! | *A flower?* | My all time favorite!!! Can‚Äôt believe genesis is this far down on the list‚Ä¶

The apocalypse in 5/8 portion is one of the best things to ever happen in music | I know it wasn‚Äôt nearly as popular, but I‚Äôd rather hear Springsteen‚Äôs original version of ‚ÄúBlinded By the Light‚Äù (only 5:06 so it doesn‚Äôt meet the criteria, though) | I‚Äôm going with ‚ÄòGenerate‚Äô cause that bass drop never sounded better but Opus rocks too. | Or Can‚Äôt You Hear Me Knocking. | Yes! | Yesss on Epitaph üôå | Alla dis | Excellent contribution! I love Of Montreal and the Voidz so much. | yesss human sadness! a masterpiece | I always feel like Easy Money is a good intro to King Crimson, especially played kind of loud on good speakers.¬† | I may have been high as hell when I first listened to this, but ever since, I defend Taylor despite being hiphophead and metalhead. Taylor has some good stuff for sure. | every time the not 10 minute version pops up on a random spotify playlist,  I get confused because what do you mean you didn't want the 10 minute version??? | Why is this so low? | I'm not even a huge fan of hers but I do agree. This is just good songwriting, I think she at her best with that one.¬† | This is the song that made me take a second look at her work. I legitimately never get distracted or bored partway through it. It's perfectly paced. | I had to scroll far too long to find the swifties | 1000% agree | Scrolled just to find someone who said this | Absolutely. Her magnum opus. | I am surprised I had to scroll so much to find this answer. Every minute of that song is a masterpiece | It‚Äôs my favorite song hands down ever in the history of music. My favorite part is ‚Äúyou call me up again just to break me like a promise, so casually cruel in the name of being honest‚Äù | How is this not top choice?! | I commented then saw this right after haha | It‚Äôs the only way | Many good songs here, but this is the one I was looking for! | ""And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punchline goes

'I'll get older but your lovers stay my age'""

*Ooooooooooooooof.* | YES | Fucking mind blown I had to scroll this far for Impossible Soul. Possibly one of the greatest songs. Lots of sobbing every time. That album really fucking wrecks | Finally a comment mentioning Sufjan. I would add Age of Adz. | Hello I am apparently the one other person who cares about human sadness. | finally Ethel Cain representationüò≠ Head in the Wall or Sun Bleached Flies does it for me!! | Came here to say this | I didn‚Äôt want to be kicked out of the cab | Man, c‚Äômon, I had a rough night and I hate the fucking Eagles, man! | Radio stations in L A play it every 20 minutes because the universe will collapse if they don‚Äôt or so the programmers say. | It was so overplayed for decades but it really is a fine work of music. | I would also add Viscera Eyes and Day of the Baphomets! | I'm glad someone mentioned Mars Volta. I'm gonna add: Roulette Dares (The Haunt Of) and Eriatarka. | Came. To. Say. This. 
I won‚Äôt let my daughter get out of the car until it‚Äôs over üòÇ basically that whole album chefs kiss | Ascensionism as well | finally | goated |  I've just been through +100 posts and no one else seems to have said this, it's an amazing song.  
    
[Child in Time](https://youtu.be/OorZcOzNcgE?si=LQrVAHjTJ1R01_-z) | I‚Äôm in the US. A friend in England just told me about this a couple days ago. I was blown away. | The Drapery Falls is going to be a better example for Opeth. | I am 100% with you! | And every other Opeth song for that matter | It's Reptile (singular) but this was my pick as well. | Reptile is fantastic, one of my favorite Periphery songs. I listened to it last night again while on a drive home. | Came here to see this | Dang, you beat me to it. Absolutely. | The sun, the moon, the stars by aether realm too | Is Hey Jude over 6 minutes? Damn... never feels like it. | I think that song might actually be his magnum opus, since it really feels like the culmination of his career across the Trilogy/Kiss Land & BBTM/Starboy eras of his sound (also applies to the After Hours album in general). It's definitely the first song I would show if someone asked me what Weeknd song I would play that fully represents him. | I was expecting the lone Weeknd comment to be Tears in the Rain, but this too! | Three Days! | Earthless yes üôå | Love love love the CCR version!! | I wanted to buy a Maserati just to see if it could go 185. | The track Iowa is phenomenal too | Yes. | Scrolled way too long to see this one. Also, Walk On (all parts together) | I hear that song it is immediately August 1969 again‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. | About time someone mentioned btbam | Yes. I clicked on this post to comment this song | Edit the sad parts was my first thought as well | Are you just considering the entire album to be one song then? | Time? Money? Us and Them? 

I don‚Äôt get it. Which song? | Shit, I forgot all about The Path. HIM was basically my identity from 2004-06 and it was one of my favorite songs. 

Time to revisit their old albums. | >The Path - HIM

Was searching for this exact answer, such a good song. | Ehh. The last 4 minutes is just a piano outro lmao. | Took me way too long to see Funeral mentioned. Epic song! | Yes! I was hoping someone else here appreciated that epic. It's amazing live, too! | Greatest song ever written. | This song is on another level entirely. Perry at his rock god best. | damn, didn‚Äôt realize euphoria was 6m - I just enjoy the ride | Yes | Last Call is so worth every minute | It's All Coming Back to Me Now is a great song! | Kashmir!! | Also ""Silverfuck"", ""Hummer"", ""Porcelina of the Vast Oceans"", ""X.Y.U."", ""United States"", ""Thru the Eyes of Ruby"", ""Drown (soundtrack version)"", ""For Martha"", ""Soma"", ""Song for a Son"", ""Pentagrams"", ""Edin"", ""Glass and the Ghost Children"", ""Oceania"" im sure there's more I'm missing.¬†


They have a really strong ability to make an epic arrangement where every measure serves a purpose.¬† | Save me is great too | ‚ÄúNow and never, a reverie endeavour!‚Äù | for real lol, i saw this question and thought jazz tracks less than 12 mins feel short‚Ä¶ | It‚Äôs only the last 3:30 that is great. | It's on constant rotation in my car. So good! | My heart is wild and my bones are steam and I could kill you with my bare hands if i was free. | I'd give my left nut and $50,000 to be able to experience this song for the first time again. | YES YES YES | Even better live | yes :) | I forgot about this one! | I'm 100% with you. It has always been my favorite because of the beautiful piano notes at the (lengthy) end. I hated it on the radio though because they'd cut it short. I've always told people that if you don't hear the birds chirp,  you haven't heard the whole thing.

I admit though that the movie Goodfellas ruined it for me for a while! But it's still my #1 | It‚Äôs a perfect pop song | Nah, nah, nah, nah nah nah nah! | My god are they slaying the mighty set at red rocks as I type this!!! | KGLW casually dominates every other song in this thread.¬† | I heard that the live version of Green Grass often reaches 20 minutes, and it's different every time. | Most listened song on spotify for me | I'm coming waltzing back and moving in to your head... please | I second this | I have to go Famous Prophets over Beach Life-in-Death. The whole album is phenomenal, though! | It's one of my favourite doom metal albums and just a great song to relax to | I can listen to that song over and over | Great song! | *Most of Joanna Newsom‚Äôs absolutely perfect and amazing masterpieces! | 100% agree | Wow, we sang that in chorus my senior year in high school.  Heavy stuff for 16-year-olds. | My first answer | I'm surprised no one's mentioned Aqualung yet. | Beautiful song! Hacket‚Äôs guitar solo is so haunting | Symphony No. 2 in E Minor, Op. 27 - III. Adagio | I like to listen to this with the ""medley"" songs from the album. Rainy Day, Dream Away starts it, and after 1983, Still Rainin, Still Dreamin picks up the original blues sound and finishes the whole thing.

You might come away from this not liking it, but I bet you at least come away undestanding why Jimi is still held in high regard. There is so much deep Jimi content that casual listeners have never heard. | Such an amazing band and amazing music! | I came here to say that | Great list!! Last year I got to see Steve Hackett‚Äôs band perform Supper‚Äôs Ready, and they did Firth of Fifth as an encore. It was amazing | You CANNOT go wrong with this one üôè | First song a searched for. This song has to be the most underrated song I‚Äôve ever come across | Pearl Jam did it live at Voodoo in NOLA one year & it blew us away | This was the first song to come to mind | Also ‚ÄúYou never know‚Äù is a good longer one too. | The intro is the best bit imo | Love that Thorogood song. Today I learned that it was a cover to a song written in ‚Äò53 | Just the entire album. | Not enough depressed people on this sub | Nothing Else Matters for the win | Also shit talk - Sufjan Stevens !!!!! | And Ethel cain‚Äôs very recent cover of for sure by American football!!!! | Yes! | Cultured person | Brings me back to high school! | There are a few Stone Roses songs that technically count by length and by quality. Trouble is, the last half of the song is John Squire noodling, which I find can get a bit repetitive. | One of the best songs out there! | Also, Estranged and Rocket Queen | The horns on the extended version of Move On Up are exquisite! | yesss üëç | Came here to say this | Took too long for me to find this answer. It‚Äôs the most correct. | The ultimate driving song | Classic | So sad. So beautiful. | Damn this is so right - so beautiful it's a shock to the system | Ah I recommended Only Skin. 

That whole album is a tapestry. I love it | My man | Came here to post this. The entire theme of the song of ending up where you began, just for the final bit to be the same as the beginning of The Root of All Evil is incredible | Goated. | I am sorry. | When in Rome blew me away the first time I heard it. Phil Ochs was a lyrical mastermind | Absolutely 100% with you on that one | I scrolled soooo far to find this. 

I would vote Painters of the Tempest pt II. | Exactly what I thought. Tons of people are saying it but none are getting upvoted | My introduction to them and man, was it a hell of an intro | Awh jeez, thank you! :P üß° | Yes, my choice as well. It‚Äôs perfection, especially with headphones on | Underrated AF | I was looking for this! It is my all time favorite song | I was gonna panic if this wasn't already here, ty | Was looking for this one! Virgo‚Äôs Groove is one of her best songs | Brother! | 100% | Also, Marigold. Amazingly talented band | This song is how my husband got me addicted to Jimmy. They played this live on their Futures tour in 2014ish and I about cried. Never thought I would hear it live. I‚Äôve now seen them 5 times and it‚Äôs the only time I expect to ever get it live. | Thanks, I forgot about this one. Just went back to listen again. Brilliant | It‚Äôs over 8 minutes, I believe. Amazing song. | When kanye west gets more votes than Pink Floyd, clearly we live in a fucked up world | At least you didn't say 3am eternal...KLF's gonna rock you (are you ready) ancients of MU buhahahaha | That is a brilliant list of songs there! | I was looking for someone to mention Lady T! üòç | Used to love this song. A wild ending to Superunknown. But it became a lot less fun when Chris passed. Now I can‚Äôt really get into it. Of all the celebrity deaths this one seemed most out of place - Chris made it through the early years, the fame, the breakup of his band, and then a reunion - feels weird that his death followed all those earlier stages which are typically the ones that claim their victims. | Sooooo fucking good | came here to say this | Came here to say Bodys! | Agreed! The last 4 minutes or so gives me chills everytime, but the whole song is amazing | Chicago (Adult Contemporary Version) for me. | oh and King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard - Iron Lung | I prefer Tampere.  I like the fireworks. | Omg! Yes! | 2014 I think. | Yep. This is a great shout. Must something to do with einsteins theory of relativity that this song is 16 mins long but feels like 5 | Also Weather Experience. | Heavyweight is amazing. | Wasp too | my work here is already done | Collide is so good. That album is currently my favorite from them. | Slide into the water | Tune! Gotta go listen to it now lol. | Holy moly I‚Äôm old | Ctrl+F to find this. It's the correct answer | I came to say basically any Joanna Newsom song. ‚ÄúHave One on Me‚Äù! ‚ÄúBaby Birch‚Äù! ‚ÄúYou and Me, Bess‚Äù! ‚ÄúIn California‚Äù! ‚ÄúAnecdotes‚Äù! All of Ys!

(actually surprised more on Divers aren‚Äôt 6+. She certainly packs a lot in!) | YES | I adore this song so much. It‚Äôs been one of my favorite songs for well over a decade. | Hell yeah ..that‚Äôs a Banger 

His name was Robert Paulson | Agreed, not even a huge Clapton fan but Layla was definitely the first song that popped in my head when I saw this post. | iiiit's all false pretensiooonnn | üëçüëçüëç | yesss!üëç | The lengthy drum solo in this is so worth listening to. | yesss! ü§© üëç | This is my go to! | I was upset no one had said Knights of Shame and then I sort by new and it‚Äôs the first comment I see! Hell yeah man ü§ò | Ween gets an upvote every time from me | ""multi-song song"" lol i feel you, i love those | exactly. | I came here to say this, knowing it was already said. | Seeing them play this live while the rain was absolutely pissing on us last year in Chicago was the peak of my life | in particular if performed live on their Pulse tour... | This is a fantastic honorable mention. | How on earth did I have to scroll this far to find this song? | My wife and I claim that song as ‚Äúour‚Äù song. I was quoting it in the chat roleplaying game where we met and I still remember her private message: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had that song stuck in my head the whole day and had just gotten rid of it. Now you‚Äôve gone and put it back, thanks a lot asshole!‚Äù | what about elephants? | Although, arguably, the last couple minutes of Headache do not need to be there üòÜ | This is like: my favorite painters are Monet and Bob Ross | Shit you could only include sing about me and that would take the top spot for me | Parabola by Tool | I have found my people.

My favorite song of all fucking time | this is one of the greatest songs of all time. | Hocus pocus, there is a pizza on your focus | Knights of Cydonia just meets the mark too | You spelled dogs wrong. | Purple Rain too | Goated. | Personally I'd go for Firth of Fifth slightly ahead of this, but surely Supper's Ready needs to be on the list too. | ‚ÄòThe musical box‚Äô? | Musical Box | Goated. | The 4 minute intro is cheating. | i scrolled WAY too far to have to find this | just a wild guess but do you like Will Wood? Perchance? | I LOVE neptune. 10 minutes long and worth every bit | It‚Äôs probably my favorite song, and the most genuinely human thing Roger Waters ever wrote. The fact that that Syd wandered into the studio when they were making it still makes me feel feelings. | For real!!!! Lots of comments about it now though! | I said exactly the same thing | I scrolled the whole thread expecting not to find this and I'm glad I did. 17 minutes that go by really fast because of the amazing story. Not to mention the amazing guitar work by the late, great Denis D'Amour (RIP Piggy!) | +1 amazing song | This should be higher | With I Know You Rider | Only (!) 5mins 55seconds long, doesn't qualify. | Mike Love, the Beach Boy? Or Mike Love, the reggae artist? | Worth every second, really | I loved playing this one on the digital jukebox at the bar back in college. | Also Goa Trance musics as well. | Came here to say this as well. | Actually the Live After Death version is the best. It rocks fucking hard | Ayyy, Black Swan gang | # ""Stained, Brutal Calamity"" - Theme of Supreme Calamitas | The Diamond Sea - Album Version/Alternate Ending is the only answer here. It‚Äôs like listening to the Animals album by Pink Floyd. Put on some headphones and let it take you on a journey. | Good call | Also last call from college dropout | Oh and I trawl the megahertz by Prefab Sprout | Black to comms by MC5 and Rama lama fa fa by MC5 what sucks is there‚Äôs so many versions of the songs you have to find the good ones. | Mirrors - Justin Timberlake | If metallica, then the call of ktulu | Otherwise it‚Äôs about 9 minutes | Anything by Tool | Just kidding it‚Äôs 4:20 minutes long | Oh Gosh, I ‚ù§Ô∏è you lamb chop. | yesss. And Ghosts of the Midwinter Fires | Bro | I assume you mean ‚ÄúBohemian Rhapsody‚Äù by Queen? | ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è | Considering that songs are like usually sitting somewhere between 2,5 and 4 minutes, yes. | *David Caruso enters the chat | ***Flings arms around in windmill air guitar fashion enthusiastically*** | Yeah, it‚Äôs like Bush said:

>Fool me once, shame on... shame on you. Fool me‚Äîyou can't get fooled again.

Sage words.¬† | I was going to say Yeah Yeah Yeah | Straight to jail | The music video gets me every time |  nothing else matters by metallica | Rock and roll doesn‚Äôt give a shit about a few seconds. | Any fans who haven't yet heard Hot Chip's mashup cover of this and Springsteen's *Dancing in the Dark* should check it out | Their best song imo | a song guaranteed to make me reflect on my waning youth every time. | nope Someone Great is still the best | Ugh.  It's like they made a song out of a 3:00 AM passive aggressive drunk Facebook post from a 35 year old guy with a terminal case of rose tinted glasses who wishes he was still in college because he feels left behind by his BFFs who have distanced themselves from him because they're all busy raising kids and he won't stop whining about getting dumped by his 22 year old girlfriend.  I skip it every time out of second hand embarrassment for James Murphy. | Sometimes you just gotta dance yourself clean. | I prefer the closing song ""Home"" but it works well mainly because of how it uses the same ""motif"" between the two songs. | Universe* | *for y'all have knocked her up | Funk musicians are really underrated in my opinion, some of the best to ever do it | Eddie Hazel is so underrated | Yes haha came here to comment MG and GTBT... Your comment is exactly my experience of GTBT.  Both songs =some of the most beautiful and mind-changing music!  I love Eddie Hazel!! | This is THE answer right here. 

For my jazz heads, Miles Davis‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Ghetto Walk‚Äù is a 27 minute masterpiece | Really a lot of Funkadelic songs are incredible, I'm not sure why they aren't more widely listened to, I put them up there with Floyd | If it's two songs, isn't that double-handed? üòù | Beautiful song | Karma police ... So good ! | It truly is.  The word masterpiece gets tossed around a lot, but OK Computer is basically the definition of the word. | I don‚Äôt even like listening to individual songs from it. I‚Äôm never disappointed to hear them randomly, but I *only* ever listen to the whole album if it‚Äôs my choice. | Remove ""Fitter Happier"" and I agree.

Hate me all you want, but OK Computer would be truly sublime without it. | Play OK Computer while watching the movie Baraka. After OK Computer ends play Kid A.


You're in for a treat. | I‚Äôve tried to like it many times.  I just don‚Äôt get it.  And that whiny singing just makes me cringe. | Clocks in at 5:57 so just missed! | >a radio station DJ who one morning started playing Blinded By The Light (the Manfred Mann version) over and over

That's what happened with Kenny Everett and *Bohemian Rhapsody*. EMI were refusing to release the full version, until Kenny put it on high rotate one weekend. By Monday, the public demand in record stores made them change their plan. | On one of those prophesized ""end of the world"" days the religious nuts came up with, a local bar was having an ""end of the world"" party. 

The business paid a popular radio station to play R.E.M - *It's the end of the world as we know it* on loop for literally the entire day as a promotion. The only commercials that played that day were for the end of the world party.

I couldn't bring myself to listen to something else, cause I would giggle every time it started again. | I remember years ago one of the Chicago radio stations played Lose Yourself by Eminem and right after the dj said something like wow that was so good I'm playing it again. Someone called in and asked to play it again because they caught the end and he did, then someone complained and he played roughly 10 more times in a row. Phenomenal | A bunch of years ago a local station was changing genres and names, and they played ‚Äúhere comes the sun‚Äù on a 24 hour loop during the transition | wrapped up like a douche | ChatGpt has entered the... Uh, chat:

Yes, a radio DJ did play ""Blinded by the Light"" by Manfred Mann's Earth Band on repeat one morning. The incident happened on December 16, 1976, when DJ Steven Clean (real name Steven Smolian) at radio station WKLS-FM in Atlanta, Georgia, played the song continuously for about 3 to 4 hours.

Steven Clean was reportedly frustrated with the station's management and used the song to protest. He chose ""Blinded by the Light"" because it had a long playtime (over seven minutes) and was a hit at the time. This stunt led to his dismissal from the station, but it became a memorable moment in radio history.

The song itself is a cover of Bruce Springsteen's original, and the Manfred Mann version is known for its distinctive, upbeat arrangement. | Along the same vein a local Dallas alternative radio station laid off some DJs years ago so in protest one of them locked themselves in the booth & played the ""Barbie Song"" on repeat for over an hour. üòÇ | I'm picturing a DJ barricaded in the booth, with his engineer bound and gagged in the control booth. | They did that with a Missy Elliot song I think Lose It when it was first released. I thought I was losing it. | Thank you! | The Orgy cover (1998) is where I heard it first. I don't think I heard the original until years later. | Im going to listen to it for the first time in my life now, wish me luck! | I actually had a brain injury that caused a structural amnesia.   I got to experience all sorts of music all from new again.  I know that I loved Nina.  

I'm going to go listen to this song right now.

Edit to add:   I knew I loved Nina. Brain damaged or not. | I dont know, for me a song reaches its peak when i've heard it a few times so am familiar with it, but it's after a few listens that it reeeally clicks how good it actually is. Sometimes if it sounds really good on the very first listen it gets old quickly | First time for me was over the credits of Inland Empire, which would be hard to top. | This. Thomas crown Affair remake is one of my favorite movies. The style the feel but especially the the music.  I use the line ‚Äú I just like my hay stacks, Bobby. All the time | Yes! That whole film had a perfect soundtrack. | I miss limewire üòÇ I had so many burnt cds back then | Remember it sat there in my napster library. | Damn that show sucked | Had to scroll too far for this. | I love the Verve remix albums. | There's a documentary called What Happened, Miss Simone?which was so tragic. | I'll get downvoted with you. Totally agree with this. 

3 total minutes (2:14 mark - 3:50 mark and 7:08 mark - until about 8:30 mark) with the same screaming call-and-response of ""power (power, lord)"" is a bit too long and harsh. Detracts significantly. Same effect could have been made with 15 seconds, each. 

Rest of the song is 10/10. Wish Thomas Crown album was on Spotify. I have been looking for a modified version or cover that cuts down those call and response sections. | Great story, mate | That's such a beautiful moment. Thank you for sharing. | Wholesome content! | your story made me want to listen to the song. i found a living room performance on youtube. i absolutely love everything about it. | I have no idea what I just read, but I feel your joy. And can relate to the silly crowd and pure happiness moments like these. Cheers! | That‚Äôs so cool! I saw that show too and I wrote an entire paper about it in college. | What‚Äôs the documentary called? | I saw them in Philly on that same tour and yes, it was phenomenal. | Yes! Also my most like favorite show I've ever been to. Also the encore was something. I just remember the opening band had a singer that we called ""drunk bill murray"" that crashed during part of the encore and it kind of turned into nonsense for a bit...great show. | Just the opposite for me. I picked up The Crane Wife knowing basically nothing about the band other than people I trusted had recommended them and was immediately blown away by that track. | Ooooh!!!! I‚Äôll definitely give those a go! I don‚Äôt know why I haven‚Äôt thought to listen to all their songs yet lol | I first heard of them 2 years ago and have listened to nothing else since. Enjoy! | Joan in the Garden is amazing but I admit it could be ten minutes rather than twenty | The Tain is great | I can imagine a hiker shout-singing, ""Find him! Bind him! Tie him to a pole!"" while walking alone through the woods, and bears nearby hiding and looking at each other like, ""Yo, this dude is CRAZY."" | ‚ÄúBearinoid‚Äù would make a great merch | Yes! I always ‚Äúplay‚Äù the movie in my head when the song plays lol | Same! | Recently I stumbled upon ‚ÄúFin‚Äù specifically talking about their ‚ÄúLost at Sea‚Äù album. Only relative is the sea theme but I would say give them a listen? | Right! Me either and I absolutely love it | I scrolled and scrolled and never saw it so I‚Äôm glad others enjoy it! Definitely a top tier song | It's my 11 year old's favourite Decemberists song. He never let's me skip it! | It's crazy to think how one band has had such an influence on my life. Pink Floyd is my all-time favourite band, and I was born in the 90s. The Wall, the movie, is a masterpiece as far as band album movies go.

I am so appreciative that Pink Floyd ever existed. Their music is remarkable. | God I love Animals, it's such a fantastic album! | Definitely Time. | Us and Them. Yes, theyre all incredible. | and when played in Pompeii, it doubles the worth... | Definitely Time | TIME | How long is Shine on you crazy diamond? | Shine On You Crazy Diamond. Both of them, back to back.

Dogs. | It's more like, which long PF song should you NOT listen to? That's a shorter list. | Shine on You Crazy Diamonds (6:26 - 7:30 is for me one of the best pieces of instrumental music ever) | Came here to say this. I'm very pleased that I found this comment so high up the list. | > Echoes.

Chills every time. | Shine on you crazy diamond | Echoes is amazing but I can rrreeeaallllyyyy do without the several minutes of seagull sounds. | Was gonna say 'shine on you crazy diamond', so I'll tack it on here | My answer was going to be any 6+ minute song by Pink Floyd Especially the Syd years. So glad my stagecraft career started with them on Division Bell. My 2nd and last time seeing them together live | Yep I love all of their long songs! | High hopes made me listen PF. So I mentioned it together with atomic heart mother | Echoes at Pompeii is brilliant | Echoes at Pompeii is just so good | Back then albums were made to be played in their entirety. I was a teen in the eighties and I was so happy to get a cassette player with auto flip, lol. | Time hurts too much.


>*Tired of lying in the sunshine Staying home to watch for rain¬†¬†

Ten years have got behind you¬†

¬†...just kills me entirely. Pretty much that whole album does except for Money.


EDIT: Reddit always butchers my formatting on mobile. | Shine on you Crazy Diamond 1-5 and 6-9! | I am not gonna lie, I scrolled down to see if someone mentioned Shine on You Crazy Diamond. | I feel like Welcome to the Machine doesn't get enough love from the Wish You Were Here album. That's my favorite song on that album | Shine On Your Crazy Diamonds!  Part one AND two!! | Time: We're going to spend two minutes faking you out on when the rest of the band comes in.



I remember even Waters said he'd get it wrong sometimes. | Echoes is such an incredible song but man does it take a lot of energy to listen to. It‚Äôs like 25 minutes long lol | I was here to nominate Shine On You Crazy Diamond, but I like your answer better! | Atom heart mother? I think not. | Id love it if a couple minutes was cut out of the middle of Echoes tbh - still comfortably over 6 minutes mind,. | Not wrong‚Ä¶ | This is the right answer | Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast? | Echoes in Pompeii goes crazy | Also my preferred version, that version is perfect to me. | What I love about this is you can see the audience completely fixed on the band and the music. What that audience witnesses that night for a couple hours would have changed their lives. They entered a new plane / dimension that night.

The solo guitar üòç‚ù§Ô∏èüò¢ | In my opinion, this is the greatest live performance of all time. I rewatch it from time to time, sometimes the entire concert, and get chills each time. | Literal goosebumps every time I watch it. 

I want a T-shirt or a poster with a shot from the end where it‚Äôs just his dark silhouette with the light shining from behind, just the man and the music, so iconic | I love that song so much. There‚Äôs a video on YouTube of 2 dudes playing it on the street in Jerusalem and they play it damn near perfectly. | Biz Markie | My god this song | I get goosebumps just reading the title. Best Zeppelin song ever imho. | I‚Äôve been learning to play this on guitar and it‚Äôs so much fun to play | My underrated favorite | came here to see all the led zeppelin picks lol | Couldn't agree more. Favorite Zeppelin song and that's saying something considering their catalogue | We can name 6+ minute Led Zeppelin songs all day long but this one right here would be my choice. Followed by Kasmir and the Rain Song. | A few years ago, I spent a month reworking this old China cabinet into a record display for my gf. Mounted a pink neon sign to the top mirrored section of it. I worked in a soundstage so I set it up in the center of the room, wish a fresh turntable & brand new speakers. 

Walked her blindfolded into the building, into the darkest room imaginable and dropped the needle on this song. Hit the remote on for the neon perfectly with the first drum hit. It‚Äôs her favorite gift of all time and a she equates a big part of that to the reveal. | Bonham hammering the everliving shit out of those drums though | Tool‚Äôs version is better. | Tea for one? In the light? Yes. | Jimmy just sweating alcohol lmao | Full version is 9:48 of pure emotion | Hell yeah | Ooouuuuuuuuut of liiiife | Same lol | It was the top post on mine, i feel called out by algorithms | I want it on vinyl so bad | To each their own ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è | This guy Muse‚Äôs ü§òüèΩ | I grew up just up the road ( neighbouring town) from where Richard Brake was born. Agreed though, great video ü§† | Feels like he got really gobsmacked by just how icky and unsympathetic the industry bigwigs were to him‚Ä¶ and he‚Äôs taking it all out on us. | What do you expect from Reddit | They get the likes, and are not here for new music ideas, just confirmation bias. | reddit try not to name Pink Floyd in anything music related challenge: | Millennials love dad rock. We didn't have the internet until later, so the onus was on parents to expose us to music. And dad rock mostly sucks. I find Pink Floyd to be unlistenable, and have for 40 years. | I'm 53 and I love this song! It's amazing to compare the two halves of the song, plus John Mayer's guitar outro. | I was scrolling for ages looking for an ACTUAL song | So pleasant of you | Take your meds grandpa | ?? Chill out oldieüòπüòπ | You‚Äôre an idiot | was he perhaps too ""thug"" and ""scary"" to you? | That ^^^pinnnnnggg ..shivers every time | Also, Time | Meddle by Pink Floyd | Came here to say Echoes | So many Pink Floyd songs could make this list. | Especially when set to [the last 23 minutes of 2001: A Space Odyssey](https://youtu.be/OSOnYrF_Qgo?si=1a7x2ojIl9AGKRh2) | Echoes Live At Pompeii. My favorite song of all time | What a song............unbelievable xxx | I said this to somebody else in this thread and now I‚Äôm saying it to you too. 

Echoes is amazing but I can rrreeeaallllyyyy do without the several minutes of seagull sounds. | That whole songs a vibe. Especially that first line of vocals | ‚ÄúStrangers passing in the street/ by chance 2 separate glances meet and I am you and what I see is me.‚Äù | I set Sheep as the background track of my Master's thesis which was an animation of infinite 3d sheep in space. | Sorrow | Goosebumps | High Hopes live in Pompeii might be my favourite version of any PF song. The way Gilmour plays the solo is perfection | I love the solo in high hopes | Dragged down by the stone.... | Pigs | I saw them on TDB tour back in ‚Äò94. Hands down the best concert I‚Äôve ever attended. | Knew I'd find this comment here | That was my first thought, any song by Tool. | Personally love Invincible, but the whole album is incredible | I love 7empest | I love this version of pneuma    [Danny Carey | ""Pneuma"" by Tool (LIVE IN CONCERT) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FssULNGSZIA)

  
7empest¬†is absolutely great | Fuck here we go again | Yup. Right in two is good as well | Here‚Äôs Tom with the weather. | I got very heavy Pink Floyd vibes from Fear Inocolum | Actually life changing music | Absolutely. When the beat hits changing from Parabol to Parabola never fails to give me goosebumps. | If you haven't, check out the video from Danny Carey where he is playing Pneuma live. I revisit it once or twice a month. Definitely incredible. | It‚Äôs actually the song that got me into Tool! Still one of my favorites, though there‚Äôs just something about the Grudge that makes it my personal fav | I didn't even read the other comments, just scrolled. | I found my people | Music video is so fucked lol | I was going to suggest Wings for Marie.

Let's just get people ugly crying. | 7empest as well üòç | I love Third Eye, it's so good. Tool as a whole is such a unique band, I can't think of another artist with a similar sound (not counting Maynard's other projects) | Especially the Salival versions. So very good. | Also wings for Marie! | Epic track and arguably Danny Carey‚Äôs most jaw dropping composition. | That and Eulogy are my favorite longer ones! I love the topics and lyrics of these songs! They are ones I really love but to be fair, I love a lot of Tool songs! Lol | Listen to Lost Keys (Blame Hofman) before Rosetta Stoned. They go together! | HOLY FUCKIN SHIT HOLY FUCKIN SHIT HOLY FUCKIN SHIT | Alrighty then‚Ä¶picture this, if you will‚Ä¶ | https://youtu.be/14yO95OVsLE | I would say the first 5 minutes are decent, but the second half of the song is amazing | Play it three times in a row at the bar and it definitely throws people for a loop. | The minutes turn to hours | Agreed I would‚Äôve thought under 4 minutes | My friend likes to sing this at karaoke. Trust me it's pretty long | I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat. | I dunno, dude's kind of a wreck | I love that song too, but keep in mind that when he sings *""I don't know where we went wrong ...""* that they broke up and got divorced because he was repeatedly cheating on his wife. I'm no marriage counselor, but I think that may have been it. | Art Bell used to play that one a lot when he needed to step out into the high desert air for a cigarette. | It is the most beautiful song ever. I love his clever harmony in the chorus. Simple but impactful. | I always assumed the repetition is alluding to being unable to sleep and just listening to the waves and wind batter the ship, waiting for when it either stops, or it's time to go to work. | I mean think of classic sea shanties and sailors songs. Many of them are like that, where they were essentially a poem and a single melody was used to sing it out. I think it was very creative | Roundabout got me into Yes, and Heart of the Sunrise made me a huge fan. | They're my favorite band, have been for forty years, but Tales is pretty far up their ass IMHO.

Now Close to the Edge, that's the perfect song and album. | and you a I is my favorite from that album. | This is 100% what happened.
If you read the biography of Ozzy, he wanted to to know Rick Wakeman's thoughts on specific LSD. He learned that they were recording on a studio across the road. Ozzy arrives to the place and finds Rick Wakeman on the brink of alcoholism. Rick tells him that they have no artistic lead, they simply went to the studio to wait that their genius minds just brings up something great, that they have no need to direct or limit their creativity. This happened during Tales from Topographic Oceans | I legit thought yes was an obscure one hit wonder because I only ever heard about roundabout, first time I heard ""your's is no disgrace"" I was floored, how are they not more well known. Imo they where the gold standard for the genre. | In a way they did. After Bruford left, they dove into the deep end of the prog pool and made the less successful albums Tales and Relayer. Their overcorrection to more pop-influenced rock with 90125 was their death IMO. While contemporaries like King Crimson made killer tunes with 80s new wave influence, Yes just couldn‚Äôt get the formula right. | Or better yet, ""Yours Is No Disgrace.""

Also:

""Foreplay/Long Time"" by Boston

""Fountains"" by Starcastle (they've never heard of you, either LOL)

""La Villa Strangiato (an exercise in self-indulgence)"" by Rush

""Jenny Ondioline"" by Stereolab, all 18 minutes of it

""Kashmir"" by Led Zeppelin | Yes, those are so good | Or ‚ÄúAnd You and I‚Äù | To be continued | So glad they brought it back for the closing credits of Stone Ocean's finale | Why the hell isn‚Äôt the ladder talked about more? Lightning Strikes is so good. | Best cover in existence | I just saw Jon Anderson in concert last month. He was phenomenal. Just amazing. | I just found it last week after knowing the original track for years and holy shit ü§Ø it‚Äôs incredible. But Soulwax is amazing so no surprise really¬† | Also Borderline (Blood Orange Remix) üë®‚Äçüç≥ü§åüíã | plz tell me u listened to the rest of the album | Were you in Despacio? Because that happened to me there with the soul wax remix | So was I as a kid. Fantasia was amazing. The original remake from the 90s is what first got me into it then Fantasia 2000 came out. Although it didn't quite hit the same as the orig 1940 version, its still a classic in my book.  Fun fact. Fantasia 2000 was the first animated film to be shown on IMAX | I think also it was Leopold Stokowski's conducting. Everything he did was magic. He was also the ""Leopold"" from this Bugs Bunny short I grew up watching  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt1V61SPI\_w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt1V61SPI_w) | No one will ever convince me that cannons aren't percussion instruments | My mom loves the Pas de Deux! She saw really impressive choreography of the dance when she was younger and saw the Nutcracker for either the first time or close to it, so she always talks fondly of it.¬† | My other suggestion was 1812 Overture! It makes me feel so happy when I hear it. [Someone here on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/aviationmemes/comments/1dvkude/1812_overture_but_i_replaced_the_cannons_with/?rdt=51018) replaced the cannons with airplane and space shuttle sonic booms, and the result was epic!¬†

Nutcracker Suite wallpaper sounds really cool!¬† | That‚Äôs a fun one! I always liked the main theme, especially since funnily enough, I first heard it in a piano ballet class arrangement.¬†

I played classical music growing up, but I discovered a lot more through ballet. Gershwin was one of them.¬† | You‚Äôre welcome! :D | I walked down the aisle at my wedding to the intro to this song I love it so much. I agree this answer was way too far down in this thread. | I am so interested to know where he extended it lol was it more lyrics? More instrumental? | You are so lucky! That would have been epic. | Likely same tour, my friend and I were pumped...when he got to the end of the cruellers bit he said he forgot the next line because he had done so many Canadian donuts that weren't normally there so he started the song from the top and did it entirely a second time | I was hoping to see him play it when I saw him on his last tour but he didn‚Äôt. I am 99% sure that he played it when I saw him at the Running With Scissors tour in the late 90s/Early 00s but I don‚Äôt remember. I tried to look it up on setlist.fm but don‚Äôt remember the date and gave up. | And you can eat soup out of the ashtray if you wanna. It's okay, they're clean! | Currently at work, and after posting this, I had the urge to listen to it. Well, I can't play audio right now, so I just googled the lyrics. Even though, I haven't listened to this song in probably about 25 years, I can still PERFECTLY hear his voice as I read. Every bit of intonation, stress, and pause. It is still a MASTERPIECE. | So much better than Albuquerque. He just tries too hard with the absurdity in songs like Albuquerque (I‚Äôm also looking at you, Stuck In The Closet With Vanna White). They seem forced. But Ball of Twine is a masterpiece. | When I saw him live it was at a venue called the **Westbury** Music Fair. Guess what type of doughnut got added to the song. | I hadn't heard it before so based on these comments I thought I'd cue it up just to hear what it was like. I wasn't planning to listen to the whole damn song | Epic song. | 100% Anaesthetize, SUCH a good song. | As much as I love Anesthetize, I disagree with your last statement. There are quite a few prog songs that justify their length to get their points across and sometimes you even think that they needed even more time! | And add Steven Wilson's solo work to this list. The Raven That Refused To Sing is a phenomenal album, and all bar one song is over 6 minutes so belongs here. Highlights for me are the Holy Drinker and title track | Ow! Right in my age! I forgot this came out that long ago. Thanks for reminding me that I‚Äôm a punk rock geriatric. | 24 years ago?!?!? Fuck me‚Ä¶. | Really, sloppy live? I never would have guessed. I wish I could double-hit on a single kick pedal like that guy. It's a god damn inspiration for me every time I listen to them, to not use my double kick when I'm playing punk. | Saw it live twice this year (Tokyo Japan, and Brockton, MA). | kid holding the plane? have the same one | And their album ""45 or 46 songs that weren't good enough for our other records"" | 17, but the last 2 or 3 are kinda just padding the run time. | I'm not ready let's do this | Reeding iz hrd | Damn. Didn‚Äôt know they were touring. Already missed their show. | Enjoy! I saw them about two weeks ago and they were awesome! | I had to look this up. Song has NEVER felt that long to me. Today I learned it is | It's not long enough | Agreed. One day saw it in the music library and thought, ‚ÄúNo, it can‚Äôt be 8:45‚Äù it is, and always has been.¬† | There's a 16 minute [live version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm03wqLY3Nc), in case you want even more Purple Rain. | Could be because a lot of radio/DJ's always cut it off before the big guitar solo at the end. If someone got introduced to it on that platform, I could definitely see how it only feels like 5 minutes. | It feels like 5 but it's really 9 trust me baby. | Blame the radio stations. They always cut it off after the singing ends. 

I've always said that it's so great, it's over after 4¬Ω minutes but you still listen for another 3... | ‚Äú‚Ä¶.smash up my ride ‚Ä¶..  well maybe not the ride‚Äù.  üòù | As is Natural Science | Probably my favorite Rush song. | Had to scroll far longer than I wanted to find this. | Neil had to do that on purpose to fuck with us.

Eight is comfortably numb, this is nine at the moment. | It's a shame that something can be ""too obvious"" so it's not appreciated as it should be. | I've never understood why Achilles Last Stand doesn't get more attention, either. | Agreed | OH NOOOO, TO MANY PEOPLE LIKEY, ME NO LIKEY NO MO
Cliche... | Most Metallica instrumentals absolutely tick this box. | This is the one right here. Cliff's tracks on Orion were what convinced me to pick up a bass and learn to play.

I am *nowhere near* his level of talent, but that's okay. No one is. | I had never heard a bass guitar have its own solo like that and young me was floored. | Cliff was such a beast wasn‚Äôt he?? | I saw a YouTube comment once that perfectly sums up that song for me. 

‚ÄúI love the way Orion fades in and fades out. It‚Äôs like an eternal song and this is just the 9 minutes we were graced with getting to hear‚Äù | One would be my pick, that or Fade to Black | Or Four Horsemen | Did you ever find it? | Ya I originally thought of pretty much the whole album | Way too far | Fuuuuuuck yes | I got my 3 year old into some metal with this song. Now when he asks for ‚Äúmedal‚Äù I know he wants to start with this. | Listening to ROTAM right now, fantastic song.¬† | Saw them play this live, must have been back in 2013 or so. Shit was EPIC as hell | On or atop my list of favorite Maiden tracks. So. Damn. Good. | I genuinely forget that Writing on the Wall isn‚Äôt one of their ‚Äúfast paced shorter opening tracks‚Äù, it feels like a 4 minute song. That album proves that time is relative | Love that cover | I never skip it, it‚Äôs so good | I only sit through the first two minutes to get to the piano outro | piano part is the best bit! | The piano part was good enough for Scorcese to include in Goodfellas | As much as I think the piano part is iconic, I usually prefer the [5:38 live version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vgT4YleJVQ) from Crossroads 2 that omits the piano. And speaking of very long songs, the [24:19 rendition of Eyesight to the Blind/Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9o25CAvvX4) from the same disc is amazing and I always listen to that all the way through. | Yeah like once every November is enough | My dad always puts this song on Q104.3 every single Thanksgiving. It‚Äôs his most coveted tradition. | How about every time you *host* Thanksgiving? | Yep, I grew up with it being a thanksgiving tradition to play that song a few times throughout the day. | TRADITION! | That's *Thanksgivin'*, thank you very much. | Alice's Restaurant is the perfect length to wash, peel, dice, and plop your potatoes into the pot on Thanksgiving day. | A later recording Arlo mentions that it's 18 minutes, that the gap in the infamous Nixon tapes is also 18 minutes, and that Chip Carter (son of Jimmy Carter) told Arlo that they found a copy of Alice's Restaurant on vinyl in the White House when they moved in. | Time to gather my rakes and shovels and implements of destruction.... | Death By Arlo | I'm not proud.
... or tired | Came here for this and had to scroll forever.  It's 3 songs and they're all great! | Saw it performed live in 1994 Fiddler's Green. To date, one of the best concerts ever! | Absolutely! | I've always been pretty sure A Light in the Black is meant to follow on to the narrative of Stargazer anyway, they're practically one song. One song composed entirely of nonstop exceptional performances on all fronts. | Remember when we made out to this hymn? | Funny story, it's literally a warm-up jam session that got recorded, and they liked it so much they released it as the actual song | Scrolled far too long for telegraph road | One of my favorite songs ever | Agreed, including Once Upon A Time In The West | How is this not more common knowledge! Scrolled way to far down for this | Yes | The Alchemy Live performance of the song is over 10mins, which is the one I was thinking of when I mentioned it. | I still can‚Äôt believe I got to see them perform homecoming last month | That's what I made my roommate listen to every morning in grade 11. :D | I like homecoming better | I got to see it on one of its last weeks with Billie Joe in the cast. Yeah it had its cheesy moments but it was spectacular | I can't believe this album turns 20 this month. Still a solid listen to this day | It's coming back for a short run (with Deaf West) if you're anywhere near Los Angeles:

[https://www.centertheatregroup.org/tickets/mark-taper-forum/2024/american-idiot/](https://www.centertheatregroup.org/tickets/mark-taper-forum/2024/american-idiot/) | It was fantastic, I took my kids (that was the day I was a cool mom). | It‚Äôs one song with multiple parts. You could define that as 5 songs stacked together if you want, but it serves as a single function within the album. 

American Idiot is a concept album that tells a very direct story. And Jesus of Suburbia is there to establish the ‚Äòmain character‚Äô of the story. It gives the backstory of his broken home and (with American Idiot as the first song) his frustration with American society. 

So even though it goes through several distinct ‚Äòparts‚Äô it still serves as one narrative piece. | Yes it's one song with, I think, 3 distinct parts | I prefer a Passion Play over Thick as a Brick any day. They are both great, but a Passion Play is at all times exactly where it's supposed to be and sometimes I have to say that it could be even a step ahead. While Thick as a Brick is a band album I think that a Passion Play exists as a testament to the brilliant mind of Ian Anderson as it mostly sprung out from his mind and explained to the band what's happening and when and just to fill out the rest. | I love the fact that it is an album-length song.  Though when I bought the album it was on a cassette tape which meant that there was a weird fade out and fade in halfway through. | It really says something about their quality that they are two of my favourite songs and have been since I was a teenager, and I've never realized they were over 6 minutes. | This one gets me right in the feels. Heard it for the first time at just that moment in life when I was going through what the song talks about, and even though I'm embarrassed now about what a fool I made of myself over that person, I will never be embarrassed about how much I love this song for carrying me through it. | I was going to comment this! My all time favorite song. | I‚Äôm particularly partial to Ommadawn | Kashmir is one of their best. | To be fair it's very repetitive compared to most other songs here | I also scrolled long enough to be sure nobody else had put it. | While I agree, as ""Transatlanticism"" is on my DCFC Mt Rushmore, ""I Will Possess Your Heart"" literally has a radio edit due to its length.  I'm just glad both are getting this much love. | Madison square 1973 concert version! | I once was given a design project of turning a song into a piece of physical art. I choose Dazed and Confused. I painted a lovely watercolor rose, and when presentation came I tore it up, lit it on fire, and tossed it out the window. My professor‚Äôs reaction was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna get fired.‚Äù  I got an A. | I expected it to be the top answer. It's the first song that popped into my head after reading the question. | Yes, I loved Breakdown & Estranged. I used to play UYI I & II constantly. Must now be at least 2 decades since I last had a listen | Slashs guitar solo in November Rain... | Coma! | I would even prefer Estranged over November Rain | Estranged is what November Rain wanted to be when it grew up, but it got side tracked with a glue bag. | That song got me through one of the worst breakups I ever went through. | The radio edit was closer to 5 minutes | Dude no - the solos are awesome yes, but the lyrics are absolutely above ""padding""-status. | I agree so much but I feel like I‚Äôm the only one who feels that way. SO many good songs, all so different, such good stories.

Ahhhhhhhhhh he‚Äôs my favorite | Thank you so much for sharing this. I‚Äôve loved that song for 40+ years. My mom actually went to high school with Billy Joel, and told me that his band used to win battle of the bands every year. He‚Äôs a great human being. | suckin on my ding dong | Also ‚ÄúLike a Hurricane ‚Äú. | Yup. On the Beach is sooo great and Ambulance Blues never gets old. | Agreed | I don't know who that is. | Amen | Mine too. Happy cake day! | I can‚Äôt hear that moment (you know which one) without almost coming to tears. Floor Jansen is a goddess | Goosebumps | Hearing the epic beat drop of GLS in a meme video in like 2007 is unironically what got me into metal close to a decade later | Right?? Had to scroll way too far down to see this mentioned. | I hate when I drive my Chevy to the levy but it‚Äôs dry. I say to myself ‚Äúguess I‚Äôll die‚Äù | Tbh, I didn't know this song was 6+ minutes lol, so it never would hace occurred to me to list it. | the reason being is probably because it's more repetitive musically in comparison to progressive songs. | Both overplayed by boomers at every single occasion for the last 50 years and were over it? | I love the tidbit that Don McLean's kids loved Al's version so much and played it so much that Don still occasionally sings the lyrics to Al's version accidentally. | Weird Al composed that sing having never seen The Phantom Menace. He pieced together bits from the trailers and articles about the movie. | How long was the distance? | I respect your opinion but that last bit of the song is my favourite part. You‚Äôve gone on this long journey and it gets so sad at the end leaving you feel pretty down. Right as you feel your lowest it brings you back up and everyone sings along to the last chorus. Gives me feeling of hope that despite the music dying we all still sing in a happy tone at the end. | Yeah that‚Äôs a hot take | Doesn't it change each time? I might agree if it was cut and pasted but I thought it sounded different each time he sang it. | A very hot take, but I like it, too! I think on the technical side you‚Äôre right, but the meaning of having so many people join in the final chorus is a nice touch to add the joy back in, too. | Somebody already posted that one....so I went to the 2 most obvious choices next. It's not like you're struggling for choices when it comes to Dire Straits and long songs...ü§£ | I once saw a cover band where some dude wouldn‚Äôt stop shouting freebird and the guitarist started playing it, the band looked at him like ‚Äúbro wtf?‚Äù And he just shrugged his shoulders. The rest of the band joined in and the singer pointed at the guy and said ‚Äúblame that man for what‚Äôs about to happen!‚Äù Then they played all of it. | Joe Dirt 2 scene was funny. | Where I live, ""Play Paranoid!"" is what people usually yell. | Just so everyone reading this knows- Musicians absolutely hate you for yelling freebird. It‚Äôs not funny, you aren‚Äôt funny, you aren‚Äôt original, we‚Äôve heard it a million times, and you will immediately land on our shit list for the rest of the night. | Free Bird has been banned from my driving song playlist due to the way it makes me drive | Because it‚Äôs really not worth the entire run time. The solo is one of sickest things ever out to vinyl, but do we really need all the filler that before it? | Glosoli reduces me to a blubbering mess | The whole album builds to that track.  It's one of my favorite albums to just throw on and get lost in. | And the Prophets Song | I don't know why people think that song is longer than it actually is, it never feels close to being 6 minutes personally. | Oh word! üò± and i trusted him/her üò≠
How foolish‚Ä¶ almost made me rescind my upvote üò¨ | I always preferred [Innuendo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2N0TkfrQhY), anyways. | I'm sure there will be no complaints over 5 seconds unless autism plays a factor. | Because they're probably a bot, read their other post. The internet is dying. | No the song by Olivia Newton John | There was a great reddit comment after he passed-

""I don't always listen to meatloaf but when I do, so do my neighbors.""

This also happens to be the absolute best karaoke duet in existence and I have foisted on way too many unsuspecting people. | Not sure if there‚Äôs a funnier lyric than ‚Äúso now I‚Äôm praying for the end of time to hurry up and arrive.‚Äù | The entire album all at once. | One of my go-to karaoke songs! Always surprised by how many people sing along with me! | Also For Crying Out Loud, Objects in the Rearview Mirror May Appear Closer Than They Are (my personal response to this question), I‚Äôd Do Anything For Love (But I Won‚Äôt Do That)‚Ä¶ for the non-Meat Loaf stuff, Safe Sex and Original Sin. The album version of Total Eclipse of the Heart. Even Ravishing breaks the low-for-Steinman threshold of 6 minutes! So many brilliantly long gems. | I think this is a better answer | It is a classic album | Came here to say Welcome Home by Coheed and Cambria as well! | The entirety of IV is just a real good time for me. | A masterpiece by all metrics | Also The Soft Parade | I agree, but dogs is the best | Animals is my favourite album, hands down. I love the bitter and cynical tone, I love how it criticises the status quo. | Omg yes, that end is perfect | Yes, this!! Love it. Just listened to this (as well as disintegration, suggested elsewhere on this thread) and saw the middle has had a BILLION plays on Spotify!! | You're not factoring in the 5 seconds after the song ends where you sit and process the masterpiece you've just listened to | Freddie Mercury is _ALWAYS_  the right answer!! üòâ | Sounds like you're the biggest hater | Mortal Man slaps too (even though the actual song is about 5 mins long) | Said, ""LOOK, MAN-"" | She a‚Äôhollerin about the front rent, she be lucky to get any back rent‚Ä¶ | A lot I‚Äôm sure. You should watch some of the reaction videos from YouTubers listening to him for the first time. He‚Äôs seducing women from beyond the grave | That voice of his  <swoon>  RIP PS | I also came to say Bloody Kisses! | It‚Äôs just so damn good! And when I hear it played I just want to hear the whole thing and can‚Äôt help but feel pretty damn happy for hearing it.  The whole album really | Almost forgot to watch this today, thanks | Morning Dew (Europe 72) | Hello me | Haha same here. That song and video were just a perfect mash up! | Oh absolutely. They have a ton of 6+ min bangers. Where did you go see them? I was at the St Louis show last week! | I'm going to blow both your minds... how about both tracks together:
https://youtu.be/44fSjm5WT80?si=q85iXh-MGvp5EbVK | Same here. I've always been a diehard metalhead but I'm glad I was open minded enough to listen to something entirely different, despite the critics. Millions of women and girls look up to her. That means something. Taylor and her fan base have been compared to beatlemania, except this time, it's women and girls loving and cheering on another woman. I'm all here for that shit. | I feel like you could make an absolutely killer album from stuff of hers that's never been played on the radio.

How Florida isn't the radio hit off her latest is beyond me, but maybe it's because Florence outshines her on it. Who's afraid of little ole me will probably next when clear channel decides fortnite has been jackhammered into our heads enough.

I just remember hearing Maroon going, oh look Taylor grew up. | Reddit has a hate boner for her | Some people won‚Äôt listen no matter what we say, lol. But we‚Äôve been upvoted anyway! | I‚Äôm not surprised. Reddit is full of haters and I bet this comment has been downvoted more than any other on this post.¬† | Right? Omg. I saw an article last year about how Barbie and TS are so successful because they take women‚Äôs feelings seriously. OOF! For real! | Probably because there is more to musical life and history than one artist, what the fuck do I know¬† | Gorgeous album for sure, one of my favourites. | Scrolled so far to find impossible soul! Such a powerful song and album | Too bad. ON A DARK DESERT HIGHWAY- | Get your own cab. | Can‚Äôt believe I had to scroll so far for Roulette Dares. | His work with Chinchilla is amazing as well! | Oh yes.

When I think about Blackwater Park it feels like the shortest song apart from Patterns in the Ivy. I can never believe it's the second longest track. | Man, I've seen them twice and they are spectacular. One a headlining show and another they opened for Prophets of Rage. Kicked ass. 

Also hung out with Kenny Carkeet backstage. He's a really friendly and kind guy! | and plague flowers the kaleidoscope by ne obliviscaris too | You get my upvote for suppers ready!!! | That may be the best way of thinking of it, like different views of one sculpture.¬†
I remember buying it as a CD after playing the vinyl version often, and the little spaces at the beginning and end of tracks on the CD version made the whole album much more ordinary. | A beautiful melodic ""outro"" | It was actually intended for Meat loaf but they went with I‚Äôll do anything for love |  Damn thanks for the suggestions!  Haven't heard all of these, going to listen through later :D | the amount of people i have introduced this song to‚Ä¶ tossed it into work playlists, put it on at parties and on long road trips‚Ä¶ never met someone who didn‚Äôt immediately fall in love with it. truly the perfect song. | lol my bad for offending, I use shit in a positive manner- The Milk-Eyed Mender changed my lil teen self in 2004. What an era for music those years were. | Also Killer + The Sound by Phoebe Bridgers, Abby and Noah Gundersen , insaaane song | The noodling on I Am The Resurrection is some of the greatest noodling I‚Äôve ever heard, though. | I'm a 34 year old man. I can't listen to this without good headphones on my ears and tears in my eyes. I have had the privilege of performing this piece as well with my college choir. I hope it never loses its beauty to my ears. I'm glad I'm not alone. | Why? | It‚Äôs pretty wild, I consider it his masterpiece, it‚Äôs kinda like a call too I ant marching anymore a bit¬† | I absolutely love you
Painters of the Tempest Pt II. I vote for too
Can't wait to see them live in a month | Keep doing what you do boss o7 | Same. The build up to the refrain at the end of the song is just my favorite pieces of music I‚Äôve ever heard. Josh Eppard just did a long video for Drumeo on YouTube if you haven‚Äôt seen it. The drums are front and center for that and it just gives the song an extra punch. Absolutely loved it, the drums on that song are so great, loved being able to hear them that much more. | Thanks! Good to find someone with similar music taste! :) | Hell yeah. | Agreed. | Word. | I searched it in the thread after I commented‚Ä¶ further confirming I am far far far away from ever having an original thought. | he's an asshole but listen to MBDTF or just Runaway, if that is not Monet idk what is | How did I not think of that? One of their best songs! | Needs to be included. | Yo_Mama_Knows, your mother will know.  wink wink. | Ah yes, my mistake. | If that‚Äôs cheating then divorce me | Pop songs, sure | The Crass mix is fantastic bleepy delirium! | The msg version | got a link?

edit: found it

https://youtu.be/LjopZewrxow?si=kq9gIs9sOvOp3ow7 | Dear god I saw them do it live! | I love this clip of Dave Grohl talking about how he ripped off the Gap Band for so much of the drumming in Nevermind:
https://youtu.be/syLeLR9KdME?si=2hXae6rPvk_MylXE | Apparently it was all improvised, too. And he was still a teenager at the time. | They were made by the same hand(s) tbf | ‚Ä¶yes. Okay maybe I should have said OK Computer. | It's actually 3! | Two fists | Or each song had a single hand in changing it?lol idk | Double fisted? | Double fisted, pretty sure | Also it being based on hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy is amazing | 100000% disagree but i respect it

also no, man, we're talking about radiohead. sublime is a totally different band /s | I see your baraka and raise you samsara | Listening to music and watching a film simultaneously? Is it a silent film or something? | Cool | Like a lot of music, to truly appreciate it you have to try to listen to it while placing yourself in the era it was released.

Like, it can be kind of hard to understand why the Beatles are such a big deal listening to them today, until you realize that there was nothing at all that sounded anything like them before. | In Cleveland there was a station that did this when they switched formats from alternative rock to rap and r&b. | Please report back. Play it loud! | I just pulled it up on YouTube and there was a commercial in the middle of it ü§® | i‚Äôm about to do the same!! | ‚ù§Ô∏è | I‚Äôm the exact same way honestly. I‚Äôve had songs sound quite unremarkable on first listen but grow to be my favourites of all time. | Season 1 and 2 were great, the first half of season 3 was okay, and we don't talk about the rest of season 3 or season 4. I was a huuuuuuuuuuuge BBC sherlock fan, like tumblr fangirl levels obsessed, and the last two seasons immediately killed the hyperfixation that had been burning for years. | lol | A link to this video would be AMAZING!!!!!!!!! | Same. Born in '90. Pink Floyd was my dad's favorite band, and he definitely passed that on to me. He passed last year, and it's been really hard... Pink Floyd will always bring me good memories of him. Came here to say Shine on You Crazy Diamond or Echoes, but agreeing with most people in this comment, you can't really go wrong with them üôÇ | I went to a floyd concert in Toronto in the 90s with my dad. He was friends with Floyd's tour photographer, and he got us crazy tickets. Something like row 20 center. I was 15 or 16 years old. I was a huge Floyd fan at the time (still am of course). 

Best concert I've even been to. | Amen | Pink Floyd is the ONLY reason I learned to play the guitar. | I was a high school senior in 2001 and was introduced to The Wall via the urban legend that it matched up with Wizard of Oz. So one day close to graduation, one of our teachers set it up so we could test the theory. I've liked the entire album ever since. :D | Yesss. I was born in 1980 & got into Floyd in 1995 (aged 15). Never been the same since! üñ§üé∏üéß | Pink Floyd taught me so much about music. | SAME! Pink Floyd had such a huge impact on me. The Wall album and movie were played endlessly. DSOTM, Animals, WYWH‚Ä¶ they are so amazing.¬†

I‚Äôm seeing Gilmour in LA in October and I‚Äôm so excited.¬† | My fav Floyd album, used to bump it all the time on my commute. Dogs in particular just has a way of hypnotising me in that long instrumental section. | Dogs into Pigs is just orgasmic | I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôd overlooked that album my whole life.  Recently rediscovered it, fantastic.  I like Sheep. | Go see Les claypool  - he covers the entire album when he tours with frog brigades | as I have aged, Animals and The Division Bell are the only 2 Floyd albums in my regular rotation | Parts 1 and 2 around 20~ mins combined. Part 1 is my personal new headphone test song. The slow chord progression is amazing.¬† | Yeah just gotta push through that shit haha. | Always a reminder to not take it for granted! It‚Äôs a masterpiece. Dark side can take one places. | Gotta say I‚Äôm not familiar with that one hah. I don‚Äôt listen to anything before Obscured by clouds to often but maybe I should? | About four years ago I was going through a particularly tough time (the details of which I don't need to get in to), but as part of the recovery journey I ended up with a load of mates camping in a field in the middle of nowhere on a beautiful Summer's day, and I took a massive dose of mushrooms and chilled out under a tree listening to Pink Floyd.

Shine On came on right as I was peaking, and I honestly transcended. I could have swore it lasted hours, and I connected with it as a piece of music in a way I never have done with anything before. I suddenly understood them in a way I didn't previously, and I let out all the pain, frustration, and anger I'd been holding on to for so long into floods of tears.

I decided in that moment to leave all the mental hardships I'd been facing right there in that field under that tree, and when I left the next day I was never going to look back at them; and that's exactly what happened. I tore them out of me and left a different person, due in huge part to that particular song pulling me apart in a way that I desperately needed at the time.

Moving on from all the suffering, that song still holds a particularly special place in my soul, and whenever I hear it I'm transported back to that moment where I let go, and it serves as a reminder of how far I've come.

Music can change lives, and that song did that for me. | Right?  That opening riff gives me goosebumps (or makes me cry, depending on my mood) within 5 notes.

And as I get older it only gets more poignant. | +1 for Fool in the Rain | I love seeing my favorite songs randomly referenced. Rain song and wish you were here inspired my broke college ass to buy a 12 string. Still have the guitar, haven't tuned it to that wonky tuning in a while for rain song but man, that sound of the first chord is just perfect | Rain song is phenomenal | Seconded on Rain Song and Ten Years Gone but also In the Light. Lets be real, just most of Physical Grafitti lol | Pity they didn‚Äôt write them | I listened to Levee yesterday. I think it's the hardest hit drums l have ever heard. Incredible.¬† | Nope | Oh I‚Äôm just saying 5:46 is an epic moment of the full version | Booooong eeeeeeeiiiiinnnnn haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnd | Worth it | This is just my opinion, but I feel like bands/artists don't make long grand epic songs like they used to back in the day. So obviously the topic will only attract boomers, gen x and millennials who have listened to these oldies. | I love turning the lights out and listening to this song. It‚Äôs on a different level lol | That's a piano thru a Leslie speaker | I have that set as my morning wake-up alarm. | !Ping


*4ms*


Hmmm *shivers* | And Fearless (just barely clocking in at 6:09) | And Brain Damage / Eclipse.  It's one song really. | I think, the first solo in High Hopes might be my most favorite solo of any song I‚Äôve ever heard. | Invincible is so perfectly heavy and then you have Culling Voices that flows so well until that thunderous bass drum comes in. Fuck yeah, I'm gonna listen to Tool all day today. | The absolute best song for running / cycling. Such a beast of a beat | Descending is my favorite on the album. I get goosebumps. | Man that album didn't get enough love when it first came out but it has grown on everyone to an amazing degree. Good slow burn. | Would you say that you play it 24/7? | ...and Mike Portnoy trying to recreate drum part on Drumeo channel | Yeah it's really amazing to watch him play it with such precision! | Another vote for Wings for Marie. | Dude. Thank you for this. | Then play *Sundown* followed by three more plays of *The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald*. | A friend of mine was in a dying marriage. His soon to be ex wife would drag him to dinner with friends of hers who he could not bear to be near. He would log into the jukebox box app at the restaurant and play Alice‚Äôs Restaurant at least 4 times in a row on instant play as soon as they got into the building. He said it was worth every dime to see their confusion as to why the song played over and over. | Yeah and then it was rammed by the Cat Stevens | Nice. | I know. It's sad but I see it as an apology for that. | Yes!! That's the bit that gets me. Every time. | My uncle got me into Yes, posthumously. I was given is records after he passed and he had a couple Yes albums. | Cans and Brahms. Omg. | Yours is no disgrace, all good people.

They're the two that really made me realize what kind of band they were. | Close To The Edge was my first introduction to Yes, long before I ever actually realized Owner of a Lonely Heart and All Good People were also them. Also my first introduction to prog in general.  So of course they're one of my favorites. | I feel like I have a new favorite Yes song every time I put on a play list. Every time a new detail. I'm glad I got to see them live before Chris died. They're my fathers favorite band so I've grown up with their music. Right now Homeworld - The ladder is my favourite, but that may change tomorrow | I disagree.  Not every song they made was great but there were a lot of great songs in there.  
Going for the one was actually a great album.  The song Awaken is one of my all time favorites.  
Their mistake was losing Jon Anderson. Yes is not Yes without him.  That was their demise. | Yeah, love the album. Used to listen to it on repeat a few years back. | I wish! Because had they played the soul wax remix I would levitate off the dance floor | My grandparents only had Fantasia on VHS and no other Disney movies. I saw it a lot but it didn't really appeal to me until suddenly one day it clicked. The faeries, the fish, the mushrooms. I fell in love with it. Their 30 year old VHS is hiding around here somewhere, still. | It's a bit, he ""loses his place"" and starts it up again.  Because it is sooooo looooong, but amazing. | He forgets his place about halfway through the song, so they start the song over and play the first couple of minutes again, then remember where they left off and go back to that part again. Also, the part where's in the bagel/donut shop asking what sort of food they sell is extended and full of puns. | Never seen it live, but I've heard that during the ""where was I, I kinda lost my train of thought"" part near the end of the song, Al would sometimes just start the whole song over. | He adds at least 20 more donuts to the already long list, amongst other things. | When he gets to the ""I lost my train of thought,"" he restarts the song. He usually remembers when he gets to his mom force feeding him sauerkraut. Last tour he actually started to [restart the whole concert](https://youtu.be/HZiJuITpFdI?si=SmMtuIwAMZsJiVRG) | It's already like 12 minutes long, I'm wondering the same thing | Well, I checked into my room and I turned down the AC, and I turned on the Spectrovision, and I was just about to eat that little chocolate mint on my pillow that I love so very very much, when suddenly there's a knock on the door... | I saw Al live and I hadn't listened to Albuquerque before seeing him. It was amazing hearing a big portion of the audience repeat it word for word. I vowed the learn the whole thing after that. | Fair enough. I used it mostly jokingly to motivate myself to do things I didn‚Äôt want to do‚Äîlike, ‚ÄúPutting away this laundry can‚Äôt take longer than ‚ÄòAnesthetize,‚Äô‚Äù you know? | Drive home too | Yeah it gets me too, my brain said ""must have been nearly twenty years since you first saw them live"", then I remembered it's actually 24 years... | I went to Punk in Drublic fest a couple weeks ago. And they closed the second day with The Decline‚Ä¶it was amazing.

But also, there was so much grey hair there and my back was so sore after standing in a field for 2 days. Fuck. | Fuck me. Harder than I thought.

Now I want to know why the first answer wasn‚Äôt Freebird. | I've never been fond of that song so it's always felt like it's 30 minutes long to me. It makes more sense now though, knowing it's 9. | *Absolutely* my favorite Rush song! | I agree! I posted elsewhere that if you don't hear the birds chirp, you haven't heard Layla | Yes, in a movie, with a lot else going on on screen. | They used to(and still might) play Alice‚Äôs Restaurant every thanksgiving at 12:00 on the local classic rock station. We used to time it out so we could hear it on the way to my grandmother‚Äôs house. It would end just a few minutes before the kickoff of the Lions game. It was a pretty cool family tradition | I was waiting for a mammogram with several other women and just kept thinking about the group W bench‚Ä¶ | Yep you got to load it up in your VW micro bus | So we'll just wait for it to come around again... | By I. Ron Butterfly | I'm learning how to play my church's pipe organ and I understand this reference. Hah-hah! I'm old. | Caught the national tour in my town, it was great and the audience was so into it. | Jealous! I saw it the week before he started doing it. | Same! I went to New York City at the end of April 2011 with my high school (I‚Äôm from Ontario, Canada) and seeing a Broadway show was on our schedule. Green Day has been my favourite band since 2004, so it being American Idiot during its last week with Billie as St. Jimmy? Even to this day I cannot believe my luck. | Will have to check this out | Robert Plant said that is the best Led Zeppelin song | Really? I think it tells a linear story better than most songs I‚Äôve heard | Well, then, sounds like it‚Äôs GnR time for you :) | If I remember right I think Slash even gets a mention in the ""thanks goes to"" section for his melodies in Estranged. | When you talkin‚Äô to yourself! AND NOBODYS HOME!! | 1a. and 1b. for me on those albums, both are incredible. I'd have to say November Rain holds slightly higher in my heart due to it being one of the first songs I ever heard by GNR. 

That said, the first time I heard the opening minute of Estranged I was absolutely hooked and it was like I was discovering the band all over again. | Oh, but I haven't got the time-time | Warren Haynes.  Jam band legend | Check out Dave Matthews and Warren Haynes covering Cortez in Central Park. All time cover. | Thank you!! | ###8:42! | Were you the one who put it on for their karaoke in the bar the other day? That poor guy looked panicked when he realized, about three minutes in, that there was so much more to go. | 500m freestyle. It took me longer to swim than the length of the song by it's not like I was good at singing it succinctly anyway. | I guess I feel like it *is* a sad song, and trying to have an uplifting ending undercuts that a little bit. I mean it ends with the metaphorical imagery of God packing up and leaving town, it's asking a lot to tell people to cheer up after that. | The lyrics and tune are always the same. The energy level varies a bit based on the flow of the song. | Very good point, friend. I'd wager half of their catalogue is over 6 minutes each. | We dont care, play freebird. | Who hurt you? | I for one don‚Äôt get why you are so opposed to people expressing their desire to see Larry Bird live free. | I like to time it so that when I enter the expressway the solo is playing 

Officer I had no choice, free bird was playing | Getting to the climax and hitting traffic is awful. | It's not filler. It's time to anticipate what's coming. Like all the boring scenes at the start of a horror movie. | It's so much fun live too. Jonsi is so spent he staggers off the stage | And Father to Son | Probably because in the movie Bohemian Rhapsody there was a comment made about it being 6 minutes and being too long for radio play IIRC | There are so many great songs that are longer than 6 minutes.

Why add a song that does NOT fit with the OP‚Äôs question at all? | Holy fuck you're right. Looks like someone is playing with a bot that literally is an LLM. I'd know that dry, soulless style of writing anywhere... | The whole song gets funnier‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs one of my all time faves

I‚Äôll never break my promise or forget my vow but god only knows that I could do it right now

I‚Äôm praying for the end of time so I can end my time with you | Concurrently or Consecutively? | 100% | I only recently learned that it‚Äôs one of the top 10 best selling albums of all time! | I had to double check that it was 6 minutes long, it's such a good song I've never really noticed it's that long | Idk- I‚Äôve got long term effects from that song. Listened to it 2 years ago and still feel it. | To be fair, artists like Lauren Mayberry, Purity Ring, and Sia may have helped, but this is dope nonetheless. I'm sure glad I got past giving a fuck about male opinions years ago. If you can't enjoy good music thats your issue | Username checks out. | Maybe shes just not as good as you think üòÇ | Cool wind in my hair! | *slams brakes* | Absolutely. Most of your list had a huge effect on me. Good to see some Neutral Milk Hotel sprinkled around this list too.¬† | Okayyy ONE more mention is black country, new road - basketball shoes. I just had to get bcnr in here or it would be sinful | Good for you - must be a real pleasure to be able to perform it! | I saw them back in 2018, but missed them in 2023 due to covid. 

Hope the shows awesome, and I hope they come to NA after EU and SA!

<3 | It‚Äôs a fab song either way! | Lmfao. I said the same thing about the 4 minute piano outro in Layla. | There's been alot of LCD Soundsystem on this sub lately and I'm not mad at all | Yep. The drummer (Sarah Jones) is fucking solid!

HQ audio here: https://youtu.be/PyN_d28-sfw | Lucky bugger! | There a YouTube video about how it happened, apparently there was a lot of LSD involved‚Ä¶ like a Heroic Dose | I didn‚Äôt know that!?! | Nice dad joke ü´° | That's good, too, but it doesn't sync up. | In St. Paul it was the same. 93.7 The Edge was gold and went out with style. | First time for me too. Wow. | Dude's listening to it on loop | Fucking criminal | Same here! About 3.5 mins in the beat just changed so good so far! | Steven Moffat is such a brilliant writer, but I didn't think he's capable of being in charge of something long term without running it into the ground. | I don‚Äôt know why people hate season 4. I loved every season | the MC is insufferable from the get-go and doesn't even seem smart, just like a huge ass | Born in the late 60's grew up on it, still my favorite band by a mile. | Roger Waters and David Gilmore are both still touring, and still playing the classic Pink Floyd tunes. I recently saw RW and it brought me back to 1977 and the Dark Side of the Moon tour. Highly recommended, regardless of cost. | My favorite album of theirs as well. There is no track I feel like skipping, unlike on The Wall which perhaps overall has the better songs. Animals has a great vibe to sink into and no track bothers me on it. | Pigs is probably my favorite song on the album. I also think it fits well lyrically with how the world is today. | I'm glad you did! Sheep is good too. Hell, every song on that album is great. I love the pig sounds in Pigs (Three Different Ones), I don't know why lol | I love The Wall, it's the perfect album to listen to when I'm depressed/lonely | Stairway belongs here. | It's sad we don't have music like this anymore :( | I'm a big fan of that melotron sound they used in addition to the 12 string | The Rain Song is just so God. Damn. Amazing. | In the Light is a great one too.

Like I said, we could do this all day haha | Absolutely. No one but his son can ever come close. It's so incredible. I've never heard anything like it. It makes me want to learn how! | I once saw ""5:46"" tattooed on someone. Loved the devotion lol. | This is true. The push for streaming numbers has seen the average track length shrink to 2-3 minutes. Felt like in the 80s-90s 4-5 minutes (or longer) was much more common | I agree and disagree here. Generally, for popular bands or artists, to get good streaming numbers, they want shorter songs. So that's true for the charts. Another thing is that bands are just not as nowadays - especially rock bands. 

However, if you look at individual artists' discographies, there are quite a lot with longer songs. But they're not going to be the hits. Kanye West, Lana del Rey, Joanna Newsom, Frank Ocean, Charli XCX - these are pretty big names that have spectacular longer songs. They're very highly regarded among fans, so the art of long form songs isn't dead. | You should listen to the Animals album. | My favorite song by them. Underrated masterpiece. | Fearless is definitely the most underrated PF song

That being said, Comfortably Numb as well | And pigs | Why doesn‚Äôt this song doesn‚Äôt get more attention? | Just like ‚Äútheres no dark side of the moon really‚Ä¶ matter of fact it‚Äôs all dark‚Äù. | Hell yeah! Same, after reading that description, I can feel it | I never even thought about it as a running song! Trying that out tomorrow! | I'm so excited to start going back to the gym because I have Tool now! When I was going in 2018, I didn't know the band very well and the time signatures frustrated me. Now, I practically listen to them daily. I even woke up singing The Grudge for some reason lol | The waves into bass... and the scratchy guitar in the last third. It builds so well | After watching the Danny Carey video a thousand times I finally saw the Mike Portnoy one, and got blown away a whole new way. Seeing a drum genius almost faithfully recreate another drum genius‚Äôs work in a matter of hours is just other worldly!! | He actually makes a few ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù as well. | It's sooo gorgeous!! | Then play What's Up Pussycat 10 times in a row. | Wow, if it isn‚Äôt my old friend satan | This guy Gordon Lightfoots | My favorite naval disaster was when the RMS Gordon Lightfoot was accidentally rammed by the USS Cat Stevens while coming into port üòî | He also took a break in the middle of the song to formally apologize for using the word ""hermaphrodite,"" in addition to, like you say, forget the where he was in the song as he does in the studio version, but instead of nothing, he restarts the song and plays through the entire first verse as though starting again, it really was a bucket list item for my 13 year old self | Well now, who could that be? I say ""who is it?"" No answer. ""Who iiisss it?"" There's no answer. ""WHO IS IT!?"" They're not sayin' anything. So finally I go over and I open the door, and just as I suspected, it's some big fat hermaphrodite with a Flock of Seagulls haircut and only one nostril. Aw man, I hate it when I'm right! | And Luminol | The only problem with Freebird is that it is not long enough. | Yep. Similar tradition over here. | But Kid, have you rehabilitated yourself? | Sure, I was thinking musically, not lyrically | The video is so baaaad with the dolphins and axl mugging to the camera but holy cow what a song | the 30min live version of sister ray is sooooooo good i cant imagine thinking 6+ mins is long haha | Not sure why you got downvoted but it‚Äôs my favorite song from the Central Park live album. | Yeah your right.Try and think of a song of theirs, that fits into the radio time format...All I can think of is Twisting by the Pool, Money for Nothing, and Calling Elvis... | Easiest way to get me to not play freebird and call security to kick you out when you inevitably get too shitfaced and try to start something | No one hurt me I just got sick of this joke after years in the business. I‚Äôm telling you, no one thinks it‚Äôs funny except for the one dude doing it. | Fart | The boring scenes at the start of a horror movie usually don‚Äôt take up 60% of the run time. The fairly mediocre song that is most of Free Bird does. | The same issue Like a Rolling Stone had as well. | ""At all"" is wild. It's 5 seconds. OP asked for long songs and then to give an idea of length said 6+ minutes. The song is basically 6 minutes long. You wouldn't call it a 5 minute song, would you? But you'd be cutting out the best song of them all. A true masterpiece. Not even a huge Queen fan but it's undeniably the best ""long"" song. | I just noticed as well; read the profile of the other ""person"" who answered Bohemian Rhapsody, should be around the fifth highest upvoted answer on here. New profile, all of his comments are the exact same length and follow the same structure. Could maaaybe be a person but I've used LLMs a lot and every joke they add to the end of their comments reminds me of chatgpt following a prompt. I think any post like this may be compromised by bots. | See, written down it seems romantic.  ""I want my world to end with you"".

Whereas in the context of the song it seemed to me to mean that he's committed himself to this woman just to get laid and now he's praying for death because he can't stand her.

It's just much cleverer wordplay than you might expect from what sounds like it could be dumb power rock. | Yes. | The Dark Sentencer too! | She's not as bad as Reddit thinks either though | Warm smell of Colitas | Out of all of these artists I still listen to Sufjan, NMH & Animal Collective on a monthly basis, even though my punk to ska to indie- folk-experimental era lead me into the world of electronic sounds, I always come back to the indie albums from ~00s to ‚Äò15‚Äô ish era | Same here. Love it! I swear if church had played music like this, they might have kept me interested way longer | Doctor Who demonstrated this. Steven Moffat wrote some of the best episodes of the first RTD era (Blink, Silence in the Library x 2, The Empty Child x 2, Girl in the Fireplace). His stint as showrunner started off well, but he just couldn‚Äôt keep the narrative together as the seasons progressed. | The RW Us+Them tour was insanely epic to me, here in Brasil. That HUGE led screen, the sound, everything. | >There is no track I feel like skipping, unlike on The Wall which perhaps overall has the better songs

My longstanding hot take: The Wall may be my least favorite Floyd album short of The Final Cut. I can't explain it, I just prefer almost every other album. I don't think it's even down to the actual quality of the songs, because I love several of them. My best theory is that it's just, as an album, so gloomy and abrasive and *long* that I can't really lose myself in it the way I do with Dark Side or Wish You Were Here, but it's also so involved I can't just throw it on in the background like some of their earlier/post split work.

I still *like* it, being among my least favorite albums by one of the greatest bands ever still isn't that bad lol. But if I'm reaching for the CDs, it's not usually the one I'm going for. | I hear you, and for many years I've had the exact same thoughts.

But I like to think if you look for it, you're going to see a renaissance of great music is actually occurring right now.  I think there are a lot of forces guiding the ..well, er-satz bullshit that is so prevalent in the mainstream; but I also think there is some great rock & roll still being produced.  You just have to hunt it down.

I have a lot of reasons to hope so, anyways. | You really think I haven‚Äôt listened to Animals? :) | And sheep | Hell yeah! Have a great day! | Gotta throw in one ‚Äúit‚Äôs not unusual‚Äù | Then for the finale, play crazy by patsy cline | I wonder if we were at the same show or if this is a recurring bit. I loved it so much. My wife (less of a Weird Al fan) saw him start playing Albuquerque and thought it would be a great opportunity to go to the bathroom (which was one single stall serving the entire balcony, so long waits). She came back about 15 minutes later just as he restarted the song. Her face was absolutely priceless. üòÇ | Plus he extends the donut section | So anyway, he bursts into my room and he grabs my lucky snorkel
And I'm like ""Hey, you can't have that""
""That snorkel's been just like a snorkel to me""
And he's like ""Tough""
And I'm like ""Give it""
And he's like ""Make me""
And I'm like ""'Kay""
So I grabbed his leg and he grabbed my esophagus
And I bit off his ear and he chewed off my eyebrows
And I took out his appendix and he gave me a colonic irrigation
Yes indeed, you better believe it | Iconic though. Those dolphins are great | Ooooh! What record is it  on? Live At Max's?  Bootleg? | Same here and that album is incredible. IMO that is the best version of the song. | ""Walk of Life.""? ""Heavy Fuel""? hald a dozen others?

They write good long songs, but some pretty decent short ones too... | Did Ronnie Van Zant fuck your wife or something? You really hate free bird. | Bohemian Rhapsody is NOT a 6+ minute song! Yes, you wouldn‚Äôt call BR a 5 minute song but you wouldn‚Äôt call it a 6+ minutes song either!

There‚Äôs a different between 6 minutes and 6+ minutes. | Yeah that person's comments are also weird. Feels like a homebrew LLM trained on chat log data or something | Ummm I think you got the meaning right the first time.  17 and horny ain't a good basis for marriage üòÄ

""So now I'm praying for the end of time
To hurry up and arrive
'Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you
I don't think that I can really survive
I'll never break my promise or forget my vow
But God only knows what I can do right now
I'm praying for the end of time
It's all that I can do
Praying for the end of time,
So I can end my time with you!
It was long ago and it was far away
And it was so much better that it is today"" | Jim Steinman always has amazing lyrics like that! | Yeah that‚Äôs exactly the appeal and humour of it.. the irony of him saying what he thinks will please her and get him what he wants, but also unintentionally revealing that he doesn‚Äôt mean any of it. 

It‚Äôs one of my favourite songs of all time. | rising up through the air | Saaaame. Music festivals lead me into the EDM era of my life. I drive to JNewsom and the like and dance to electronic music.¬†
Edit: also Bjork. She helped me find electronic music too.¬† | I do think Mark Gatiss had something to do with it too. Both were showrunners for Doctor Who, but with Sherlock, you can see them getting way too cocky and big for their boots as the seasons went on. The whole Mary plotline (and I don't mind Mary as a character) was terrible, and then the whole Redbeard thing with Sherlock's sister that got added in last minute... It was just so bad. | Spiral out! | And a collective sigh rolls through the diner as they think it's finally over... | Recurring bit. The last tour he even [started the whole concert again.](https://youtu.be/HZiJuITpFdI?si=SmMtuIwAMZsJiVRG) | Schnitzer in Portland was where I saw him | And somehow, in the middle of it all, the phone got knocked off the hook! And 20 seconds later, I heard a familiar voice... | matrix tapes! 

https://youtu.be/_RPCI2H1sV4?si=KcqOf2IOPcZF78l4 | Oh give me a break. If it weren‚Äôt for the solo, nobody would remember the 4.5 minute song that precedes it. | Let me put it this way for you. Someone comes to Reddit looking for the greatest longform songs of all time. They don't know about Bohemian Rhapsody (somehow) but they arbitrarily say 6+ minutes because nowadays the average new song is between 1.5-2.5 minutes long, just so that people realise he doesn't mean a 3-4 minute song, but an actual epic.

Because of that 5 second difference in his question, you do not include Bohemian Rhapsody, which is definitely the kind of longform song they are looking for, and arguably has more content than many longer songs, just zero refrains, no breaks, no fade out at the end. And they never find it.

That would be a shame. You can take the question at face value, but that's why I made the controversial statement of ""unless autism plays a role"". Because anyone could make the logical conclusion that OP is just looking for longform songs to listen to and the 6+ minute mark was a guidepost, not a ruleset. This should not be taken literally. | ""haha, right? it‚Äôs like someone fed a chatbot a diet of random Reddit threads and set it free. kinda like an AI that‚Äôs still in beta but thinks it‚Äôs ready for prime time!"" -omonoonhugx


I obviously don't have to tell you who wrote that lol. | Oh yeah I think you're right!  Sorry, I just re-read what I said and it could read as snotty dismissal of the song and it absolutely isn't intended like that.

But out of context, it sounds romantic.  But it isn't. :) | up ahead in the distance | Yesss. Bjork, Kraftwerk, all the cutesy electronic tunes like Eiffel 65 & Venga Boys and the Euroelectro pop, but especially seeing Daft Punk‚Äôs Interstellar 555 on Toonami changed me forever

*Sidenote- I got to see Bjork DJ this year, and while she was adorable, it was overall underwhelming af and all (somehow still mistimed) button pushing lol. | Oh nice, I was in Seattle but same tour so not sure if it was a tour-specific schtick or an all the time thing. In any case, it was a damned delight. | And you know what it said? I‚Äôll tell you what it said! It said ‚Äúif you‚Äôd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator.‚Äù | TIME MAGAZINE PERSON OF THE YEAR: LarryDavidBallSack

Omg that acceleration at 4:00!

Thanks a million! | I like the whole song. I was just joking bud if you don‚Äôt like it you don‚Äôt like it. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs great about music. Like people like jazz, I think it‚Äôs trash music. Some people listen to death metal at the gym, I listen to classic instrumentals like Canon in D. Whatever you are into, do you. | Hey.I didn't think you were dismissing the song at all, but I love it and have listened to it so many times.  It brings back memories of groping in the car seat as a teenager.  Meatloaf so perfectly sums it up, getting married at the time would have been a disaster but in those days, that's the way people thought..  Great tune. | I saw a shimmering light | Daft Punk yes! And Postal Service of course! But Radiohead and Animal Collective probably sparked something too.¬†

That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ devastating. Nothing worse than a live performance leaving a bad taste in your mouth. Guarantee you‚Äôll never be disappointed at a Joanna Newsom concert! Andrew Bird also gives impeccable performances, if you‚Äôre into him. Surprisingly, some electronic artists have better live music than what they put out. Recently saw Daily Bread and it blew my little mind. Tipper and Dirtwire¬†did as well. | I'm sure he did it for every stop - of course he would, he's a man of the people, he's going to give his all at every stop - but like damn that is a long-ass piece of a set to bang out every damn tour date, the man has passion | <3 | My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim | I had to stop for the night..."
What show failed because someone left the show?,"The X-Files after Mulder left. | Spin City was never the same after Michael J. Fox had to bow out | 8 Simple Rules. RIP John Ritter. | Hate to say it but House of Cards was just awful post Kevin Spacey | That 70s Show comes to mind. | We‚Äôll see how long The Witcher lasts without Henry Cavill‚Ä¶ | When Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) left Grey‚Äôs Anatomy I was pretty much checked out. Then they killed Derek (Patrick Dempsey) and I was absolutely done. | Andrew Lincoln leaving the walking dead as the main character was the last nail on the coffin | Vikings sucked after they killed off Ragnar. | Sliders.

First the professor, then Quinn.

Damn, I loved that show. | Misfits, even tho it wasn't a big and popular show, they changed the main characters and went downhill | I think when Ron Howard left Happy Days, the shark jump was inevitable! | Golden Girls/Golden Palace. Palace failed exactly because Bea Arthur left, and everyone knew it. | i hate to say it but i have to say it.

Criminal Minds after they kicked Thomas Gibson out. i mean, i get why they did it, it was the right thing to do but the show was never the same. as much as i loved Prentiss and it made sense to promote her to unit chief she just wasn't Hotch.

(that's not to say that the show didn't start to go to shit the moment they started changing the main cast with every season. Hotch was just the last straw for me personally.) | I stopped watching The Walking Dead after they killed off Glenn. | House of cards, when spacey left. A criminal but a great actor | Top Gear no matter what anyone else says. | Dinozzo, NCIS | Vikings, Ragnar. Didn't fail but was never as good. | Charlie Sheen / Two and a Half Men | Bones when they killed off Sweets in the lamest way possible | Scrubs | Clone High was never the same without Gandhi | News Radio after the death of Phil Hartman | I know the Andy Griffith Show continued when Don Knotts left, but it was never the same after that. | Community fits this description on multiple levels.

The first 3 seasons were perfect. Then the creator and lead writer of the show Dan Harmon was fired from Season 4 and it was written without him. It didn‚Äôt feel the same.

It did manage to survive and get two more seasons which Dan Harmon was called back for after the overwhelming negative response to Season 4‚Ä¶ but a bunch of the show‚Äôs main actors had also decided to leave the show at that very time, even with Dan Harmon‚Äôs return. The show‚Äôs story ultimately did get a proper ending, but the reason it ended in the first place was partially because of all these departures. | I think Community handled things pretty well in the later seasons but it definitely wasn‚Äôt the same once Donald Glover left. | I still like the West Wing post Sorkin, but it‚Äôs definitely not as good | American Horror Story was not as good after Jessica Lange left. | Surprised no one else mentioned Downton Abbey! After Matthew died it was never the same | Sleepy Hollow. Killing off Abbie was an extremely stupid decision as it was, but replacing her with a child? Yeah, pass. It's not hard to see why the show got canned pretty much immediately afterward.


Heroes Reborn replacing damn near all of the original cast members was pretty bad, too. Nobody wanted a Heroes reboot with a bunch of new people. We wanted to see the characters that we'd actually grown attached to. | SUITS, when Mike Ross left. | The Office basically jumped the shark after Michael left. Still good, but not the same. | Shameless | Unpopular opinion but Chris Meloni leaving SVU tanked that show imo

Which is wild bc as a cop my dude suuuuuuuucks | The Good Wife was a few seasons in already and arguably it would have run out of steam anyway, but it never recovered from losing Josh Charles imo.¬† | The Dukes of Hazzard when Tom Wopat and John Shneider left and were replaced by two 'other' pathetic cousins. | Vampire diaries without Elena. 

The plot was already worn out, but that was the final straw | Sandra Oh leaving Grey‚Äôs Anatomy. The show was definitely past its peak by season 10, but once she leaves there‚Äôs a very noticeable nose dive in quality. | Sealab 2021. When Harry Goz passed away his son took over. He did his best but the zaniness Harry brought to the show was what made that show what it was. | Sliders after season 3 had basically EVERYONE leave. The show was shit after that.¬† | Red Dwarf after Rimmer left. | Bones when they killed off Dr Lance Sweets (my apologies to anyone who‚Äôs watching the show for the first time and I just spoiled something). It was a really hard watch after they killed off Dr Sweets | Trailer Park Boys, once Cory and Trevor left they figured they really needed them. Cory came back because they were gonna pay them more, Trevor said f*‚Ç¨& this üí© and didn‚Äôt come back so they replaced him with Jacob | Red Dwarf.


It turns out that the Grant/Naylor team was divided into the guy who came up with stories and the guy who was funny.


It needed them both. | I know some people didn‚Äôt love Quentin on *The Magicians* but the season without him was missing a ton of the heart of the show. | It didn‚Äôt fail, but Mr. Lahey leaving TPB was really sad. RIP Mr. Lahey‚Ä¶ show wasn‚Äôt the same without you‚Ä¶ | Shameless after Fiona left. I still watched and finished the series‚Ä¶ it had some nice moments, but Fiona being gone and them speaking ill of her character at times, was a hard watch. Plus, fuck Debbie, her character was the worst.

Edited to add - I mean the US version of the show | Game of Thrones after logic left the show | The X-Files | Becker was never the same after Reggie and Bob left | If Jim Parsons hadn't quit the Big Bang Theory, it probably would have kept on running | I think Spartacus was ruined by the main lead passing away | Pablo Escobar in Narcos.  Can‚Äôt believe they killed him off‚Ä¶ | News Radio

That was the reason to Watch. | Dexter became pretty unwatchable after Julie Benz left. | Richard Dean Anderson being promoted to general in Stargate SG-1 and sent to Washington, which was really him slowly departing from the show in real life for health reasons. | Three‚Äôs Company | Killing Eve- was not the same after Phoebe Waller-Bridge left | Top Gear. Spectacularly | The show did not fail in any way, I‚Äôm just stopping by to give love to OG Aunt Viv on Fresh Prince. We still miss you girl!! | Last Man Standing did us dirty by replacing Mandy. | The Walking Dead - Glenn. It wasn't just him but he was the worst one. They killed off too many popular characters for shock value and it made people stop caring. There was no relationship to be invested in or root for anymore. Also, Shameless - Fiona. | RIP Andrew Whitfield. Spartacus was awesome and the show runners even did a prequel series in hopes Whitfield beat out his cancer. What could've been | Vikings wasn't the same after Ragnars death. Especially when King Ecbert followed pretty close. | Killing off Cutter in Primeval. I like some of the new characters but the heart had gone out of the show at that point | Westworld. Surprised to not to see it here. The first season was very well adapted, carried suspense throughout the season, successfully spun many characters' development into a cohesive plot. Anthony Hopkins as the head of the park was the cornerstone of the story, and such outstanding acting. They killed him off at the end of season 1 and while season 2 was OK it was a shadow of the quality of season 1. | I don't know what it's peak would have been but 8 Simple Rules really wasn't the same after John Ritter passed. Just had its first season, he died suddenly days before the second season premiere and they had to write him out, get other characters to fill the hole he left but ratings tanked and it got cancelled after the third season. | That 70's show | The OC | American Gods after showrunner Brian Fuller left and they replaced the brilliant Gillian Anderson with an annoying internet girl thing. | 2 and a half men. But just my opinion. | Coupling. 

Not the same without Jeff. | Don Knots leaving the Andy Griffith Show. There's a reason all the repeats are b/w episodes | Top Gear UK | Impractical Jokers.

Joe left for family reasons and it's just not as good. After the lock down they did also go down hill a bit, but Joe's leaving is what did it for me | Top Gear. Without Clarkson, Hammond, and May it doesn't feel right. | I watched one episode of this cartoon called South Park, but they immediately killed off this one character named Kenny. Haven‚Äôt watched it since. | * The New Two and a Half Men
* Community (actually season 1 was the best season anyways)
* Friends last season after Chandler left and they pretended he didn't and made him working in Oklahoma, in his book he mentioned that was intention as he wanted to leave the show entirely and focus of rehab, but was talked into staying the last year, he was still in rehab, but was written in to show up variously from time to time to make it look as though he was still on the show. They probably filmed all his scenes in one day for that last season then just used various clips in scattered episodes.
* They say Cheers got bad after Shelly Long left the show, but Kristie Ally was not bad, but people said the show was not the same after. I personally enjoyed both of them on the show though.
* Dynasty (who didn't leave that show, even Linda Evan's (Blake's wife) left the show in the last year. I have never seen a show where so many cast members left though during it's run.
* Dallas (half the cast left) I think only Larry Hagman stayed the entire time, Patrick Duffy left, but came back, the wives left, the Mother was changed, then she was not even in the final season, the list goes on, still not as inconsistent with Dynasty though, but the New Dallas which ran for 3 years had Linda Gray return and some of the cast members that left the original showed up on the new series as well)
* Taxi - They removed two characters I liked, one was only in the first season named John, and the other was written out in the middle of season 3 ""Bobby"".
* Happy Days - The only cast member to stay on the show the entire time besides the parents was Fonzie and Potsie, everyone else left the show...Spike, Richie, Ralph, Chachi, Joannie...yes Joannie and Chachi came back in the last season, but it was not the same.
* Barney Miller - Why did they get rid of Abe Vigoda? He was an important part of the show
* Welcome Back, Kotter, the last season Mr. Kotter left the show over a salary dispute and I think he did not get along with the woman that played his wife, suddenly the kids had no teacher and the principal became a major cast member and they hung out in his office or he was teaching their classes.
* Boy Meets World - They got rid of quite a few major characters on the show, but the most crucial character to get rid of was Mr. Turner...he bought an authoritative yet youthful element to the show and was a good role model for Shawn, but in the middle of season 4 they removed him with no explanation, his last scene was walking down the corridor and that was it. | Community went to shit when Donald left | Charlie Sheen leaving two and a half men instantly comes to mind. | Good Times (when John Amos' character was killed off). | Nice try, buzzfeed. | An old one,but Three's Company took a nosedive when Suzanne Somers left. | The Ranch. Apparently people don't like rapists. | TopGear UK - Clarkson, May, Hammond ‚Äî cannot be replaced | Pauline's departure from Doc Martin disrupted the show big time. They invested a lot of character development into her, and her replacement as the receptionist didn't have the same charm. The writer's made it worse by restarting Pauline's romance subplot with the same guy. | The walking dead. The show was ok but the quality of the overall experience dropped dramatically once Rick left.

The Witcher Netflix show will, without a doubt, struggle immensely to retain its viewer base after cavils exit. | Top Gear | John Boy leaving The Waltons. | When Glenn died, a lot of viewers stopped watching. When Carl died another bunch of viewers stopped watching. Then Rick went away and another bunch of viewers stopped watching. The writers thought that The Walking Dead is ""too big"" to fail and kept making bad decisions. Now the entire Walking Dead ""universe"" is just sad and hilarious at the same time. | 2.5 men when Charlie left

NCIS when xiva left | So weird¬†


It may be a niche Disney show from 25 years ago but I'm still upset the main characters left after the second season that was my favorite show when I was 11 and she may have been my first tv crush | House of Cards | Very few people are old enough or even remember [Kindred: The Embrace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindred:_The_Embraced), but it was a show based on the game Vampire: The Masquerade.


Unfortunately for it, the main actor died in a car crash while filming the first season and they ended it.¬† | The final part of Yellowstone will almost definitely be on this list in the future now that they lost Kevin Costner. | Maverick, after James Garner left in a contract dispute. | Vikings after Ragnar's Death in season 4 and Beorn's actor was already contracted onto multiple other projects so could t assume the lead role and ended up dramatically changing the foreshadowed path of the story. I don't even really dislike what came after, it's just that the stuff before his death was better. | Happy days after Richie left.  Serious, why continue? | When Richard Dean Anderson left Stargate SG-1 | TJ Miller (left/was fired) from Silicon Valley

Jason Segal leaving (mentally) on How I Met Your Mother around season 6 | Glee | Bonanza when Dan Blocker died | Impractical Jokers, when Joe Gatto left. Sorry, not sorry. All 4 of the original guys need to be there for the right magic and mayhem, lol. | The office US | The walking dead and Frank Darabont. No hate, but if you watched it after they removed him from the director seat then you helped to justify the studio which I think is a pretty negative outcome. If you havent heard the story its pretty fucked and I have boycotted AMC since then. | Blacklist wasn‚Äôt the same without Liz
The OG Doctors in House | The Office with Steve Carrell | Does House of Cards count? | Yellowstone‚Ä¶.. won‚Äôt survive without Kevin Costner | Billions! Once Bobby left it lost any driving force. I mean the show was repetitive at that point but it was still entertaining even though it was dumb. Once axelrod left it‚Äôs like why am I still here? I love giamatti but without his nemesis the show floundered. | Two and a half men. | There good wife.  When Will Gardner left, it was very different. | Coupling UK, after Jeff left | Top Gear, but that's probably cheating because it was all 3 presenters rather than a single character. | Northern Exposure when Joel went home. | Northern Exposure. | Martin. After Tisha Campbell filed for sexual harassment and she would refuse to be in the same scenes as Martin Lawrence, you just knew that was thel last season. It was still a great show that defined the 90's. | Being Human (UK). The main actors ended up going to other projects but the show just wasn't the same without them, it wasn't bad but it just felt like some magic was lost. | Topher Grace when he left That 70s show. | American Horror Story when Jessica Lange left, for sure! | Everyone was begging Bea Arthur to stay for a couple more seasons on The Golden Girls, but she got tired of the jokes made about her body. During season 7 she made clear that she would not return, so the show ended. | Fast & Furious after Paul Walker died | I can't say that Monk failed because Sharona (Bitty Schram) left at the end of Season 3, since it went on for 5 more seasons, but I lost interest and stopped watching. | **Squidbillies**. | Scrubs. | House of Cards, Kevin Spacey. | The Goldbergs: although not as brilliant in S7 onward, the death of George Segal between S8 and 9 and the firing of Jeff Garlin mid S9 (and how shitty they handled Murray's passing in S10) nailed the show's coffin for me. | House of Cards. | Two and half men | The first one the springs to mind is Two and a half men | Sonny with a chance | Two and half men after Charlie sheen left  
Girls can go all gaga over Ashton, but he could never recreate the carefree, misogynistic attitude of Charlie, which was what made the show a hit.  
Walden's character could never become him, the ratings and viewers declined after Charlie left.  
It was an 8 seasons show for all I remember. | Two and a half men. | Vampire diaries. They really couldn‚Äôt save it when Nina Dobrev left. She was literally the main character it just didn‚Äôt feel the same | Impractical Jokers after Joe left. It threw off the numbers for the challenges, and also changed the vibe as Joe was most likely to say and do things the other jokers wouldn‚Äôt. | Nene Leakes RHOA |  Being Human with the original cast | Top gear | Top Gear. | Laverne and Shirley. All these new answers. Here's the classic. Also the impetus for protections for actresses' jobs when they become pregnant. | Designing Women was over after Jean Smart and Delta Burke left. | Top Gear. 

Whilst it was associated very much with Clarkson, Hammond and May, the reality is that the show could have survived if Hammond or May had left. The show needed Jeremy Clarkson however, and once he went, the others followed and the whole thing went to shit. 

To be fair, the show revived a bit with Paddy McGuinness and Freddie Flintoff, but it was still a shadow of its old self. | Northern Exposure, Rob Morrow, only lasted 8 episodes after he left | News radio when Phil Hartman died | Andy Griffith - Don Knotts | House after the Lisa Edelstein departure. | That 70s show | In Living Color, after the ENTIRE Wayans family left the show.  They refused to compromise and tone down/censor the show's content even when Fox was going to pay them an extra $70K EACH to stay on. | Kevin Spacey. House of Cards. We all know why he was killed off but the series really died with him. | Beauty and the Beast back in the 1980s, after Linda Hamilton left. | walking dead , after carl | 21 jump street. Wasn't even close to the same after Depp left. | The OC after Marissa was killed off. | Shameless/Fiona | The Witcher is about to fail, if that counts. | Charmed? | Roseanne | Does Witcher count? | The Witcher had many problems but definitely sunk once Cavill left | Fear the Walking Dead was solid until Nick was killed‚Ä¶then it became the worst right turn in history writing and plot wise | two and a half men | Cuckoo (2012) after Andy Samberg left end of S1 | Two and half men. | Lowell on Wings | SVU- when Chris Meloni left. Wasn‚Äôt the same | Two and a Half Men. 

The show wasn't the same after Charlie Sheen tripped out and got kicked off the show. | 2&1/2 men post Charlie Sheen and his eventual downslope | Vampire Diaries. The show was literally about Elaina so writing her off by putting her into a sleep until Bonnie could die just killed the show. Especially when Bonnie broke the unbreakable spell right at then end.

I loved Vampire Diaries bit man it was so inconsistent and nonsensical lol | A bit niche this, given you have to be a certain age and to have lived in the UK to know this, but there was a Saturday morning kids show on ITV called Tiswas, which had a certain anarchy and edginess about it that adults could enjoy too. 

The main presenter Chris Tarrant left, and from there it just went downhill towards it cancellation a couple of years later. | Altered Carbon. House of Cards. | Shocked no one has said American Idol post Simon Cowell | Squidbillies, the show lasted a few episodes without unknown Hinson. | Christina from Grey's anatomy it started to go down. Karev was the final for a lot of people. I don't know many who still watch. | Witcher. | Castle | Might be a deep dive but Coupling was just not the same when Richard Coyle left the show. 

Jeff was a sterling mess of neurosis and misinterpreting the situation that no replacement could really fit. | Good Times | My Sister Sam

  
RIP [Rebecca¬†***Schaeffer***](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=edac8ac752a361e3&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS887US889&sxsrf=ADLYWIIs0qqH08eeClV8SWXqsCBIkIA54Q:1725968196497&q=Rebecca+Schaeffer&spell=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi3yPrJpLiIAxWKEUQIHSj-PLgQBSgAegQIJBAB) | Suits | Two And A Half Men when Charlie Sheen left | Once Gabe Kaplan left Welcome Back, Kotter, it was kinda over. Sad, that was a fantastic show. | When Ted Danson said he'd done enough Sam Malone they actually killed Cheers. | That 70's Show. I loved when Topher Gracie was in it. I probably butchered his name but Eric was the glue. A little corny but it fit perfectly with Red's deadpan menace mode. Any time I see the it on I'll watch for blonde Donna. If I see that then I know it's time to switch 

Also, no fail, but later seasons of Family Guy. If turned into the Brian and Stewie show. I love the older seasons because of the whole family hijinks. But enough of my bemoaning. | News Radio after Phil Hartman died. I think John Lovitz is hilarious, but he didn‚Äôt have anything close to the same chemistry with the other characters. | Shameless | The walking dead after Rick ‚Äúdied‚Äù | God left this plane of existence, which is why we only got two aired episodes of Clerks: The Animated Series! | I stopped watching Orange is the New Black after they killed Poussey. I know why they did it, and I think it was good writing. However, she, for me, was the heart of the show. I just couldn't watch anymore after that. | That 70s Show when Eric left | That 70‚Äôs show. The sister change just really threw me off the first time! | In Living Color, though in this case it was a whole ass family leaving together. The Wayans were what made that show special, what made it work. After they left, it was just the rotting, dead husk of a comedy sketch show pretending to still be worth watching. | Twin Peaks | The Magicians once Quenton was gone. Just didnt have the same magic. |  Look at the shows thrived when a main character left. MASH and Cheers come to mind. | Best joke I ever heard related to this:


How much crack did Charlie Sheen smoke?

Enough to kill two and a half men. | Two and Half Men - post charlie sheen | The Blacklist ‚Ä¶ | The Office after Steve Carrell left. It limped along sadly for many more seasons, but I don‚Äôt watch those episodes. | Northern Exposure. | House of Cards | The Walking Dead after Frank Darabont left | Two and a half men | Regardless of what he did. The Ranch fell after Masterson was killed off. | Top Gear | Sleepy hollow | Sleepy hollow after the exit of Nicole Behari | Vikings after Ragnar/Travis Fimmel left. | Two Guys a Girl and a Pizza Place. The show went downhill when they killed off the pizza place. | Rob Morrow Northern Exposure | That 70s show after Eric and Kelso left randy sucked | Shetland | The Witcher did it without even releasing the season that will do it yet. Bit of a flex, honestly. | Game Theory | Newsradio without Phil Hartman was difficult to watch.  He was the heart of the show, and losing him the way they did just made it too depressing to keep watching. | Shelley Long in Cheers. Cheers recovered, but it was never the same. | walking dead, glennnnnn | Top Gear.

The best show on earth ended the day Jeremy, James and Richard left the show. | Charmed after Shannen Doherty left. RIP üò¢ | The Office, The Walking Dead, virtually any show where the lead leaves | Henry Cavill in The Witcher. He finally took a stand against the hack writers who need to be replaced by AI. | Outer Range was canceled because the cast couldn't film for another 2 years.

Great show. Thanos livin' on a ranch. | The Office | When Charlie Sheen left Two and a Half Men. | Peaky Blinders, after the actress who played Aunt Pol died. I heard that they had a lot of the filming done, and had to scrap it when she passed and had to reshoot a new script. 

The last season was some of the most awful TV I‚Äôve ever watched. | Spatcus, season 1 was great, the the main actor died, his replacement was just not the same. | House of Cards after Kevin Spacey exited. | The Oc. I still don‚Äôt understand why they did it | House of cards, Kevin spacey. | The Dragon Prince. When Aaron Ehasz was pushed out because of his problematic behavior. To me, S3 was pretty dang awesome and the writing suffered after he left,

I hope the same doesn‚Äôt happen with X Men ‚Äò97 with what is going on with Beau De Mayo. S1 (minus the Jubilee ep) was freaking amazing. | Newsradio. It was never the same when Phil Hartman passed. Jon Vovitz did a great job but it was weird in that he had already been on the show and everyone just ignored it. Also Jon¬†was zany while Phil was self centered so the dynamics with the crew were different. Jon was the main character that everyone was dealing with while Phil was someone who could be either an enemy or an ally depending on the situation.¬† | While I'm still following it for the 1996-98 era storyline, I feel like Yellowjackets took a bit of a dip after Ella Purnell left because she was one of my favorites out of the young group & I'm even more concerned now that Juliette Lewis is out.

I might also say Impractical Jokers because I felt like Joe completed the whole dynamic of the group with how shamelessly goofy & effortlessly witty he is. | My Family just wasn‚Äôt the same after Nick‚Äôs actor left due to fears of being typecasted. | That 70s show as soon as Eric (Topher Grace) left to join the military. Was already losing it's appeal but did a nose dive after that. | Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher in That 70s Show. | Transparent. No one is talking about Transparent. I won‚Äôt get into the merits of the show, but was Tambor was fired, the show lost its entire purpose. And the last season was just abysmal. One of the most surreal downfalls I‚Äôve seen in a TV show‚Äôs quality. | House of cards | House of cards once Kevin spacey left | Kevin Spacey House of Cards | Coupling when Jeff left | Any where the main character leaves. They have 1 season left at that point, maybe 2. | Northern Exposure after the doctor left. | Power Rangers | An oldie, but when Andrew Lincoln left Teachers. They brought him back for an episode or two in a later season but it was never the same. | Teachers. Managed to just about handle the lack of Andrew Lincoln by having Kurt and Brian step up as main characters for series 3 but to then kill them off screen before season 4 (in addition to removing other characters and not mentioning it) was a really weird choice and it became like a fan made copy of itself | Not really holding my breath for the Witcher | X-Files. | I know this SPOLER is part of the story - but I hated Death Note once they killed off ‚Äúyou know who‚Äù. 

For me, the book/series ends there. | Two pints of larger and a packet of crisps went downhill after Johnny left ü¶à¬† | Criminal Minds after losing Hotch and Morgan.

Thats 70s show after Eric | Mom | The Wiggles were never the same after Greg. Hot Potato, Hot Potato | ‚ÄúParks and Recreation‚Äù faced a significant challenge when Rob Lowe and Rashida Jones left after Season 6, but the show managed to continue and conclude successfully. | Misfits after the main cast all bailed. | House of Cards. | That 70's show, when Foreman and Kelso left it was a done deal. | The Witcher | I will *never* forgive whoever is responsible for killing off Chad Radwell in Scream Queens! | Designing Women after delta Burke was forced out | When Felicity cut her hair lol | News radio after Phil. Love and miss you Phil | Not really failed but ‚ÄúCommunity‚Äù was so much better when donald glover was in it | Community. Not just one but 3 main characters. | Altered Carbon. House of Cards. Homeland after Quinn and the sarin. | Top Gear after Clarkson, Hammond and May left. | Two and a half men | Boardwalk Empire didnt *fail* after a main character died, but it definitely wasnt the same | Good Times after the father died. | The Witcher without Henry Cavill, and Two and a half man after Charlie sheen | The original Beauty & the Beast after Linda Hamilton left. | Undisputed - Shannon Sharpe | the walking dead after glen died then we had his son die..just got worse. | Top Gear

2 1/2 Men | Mom.   And I miss it.  One of the funniest shows | In living color
The wayans brothers | The last ship after Rhona Mitra left | Spartacus. Lead actor, Andy Whitfield, died of cancer and the show was never the same. | Trailer Park Boys after the death of John Dunsworth. You need Lahey for that show. Rest easy, you drunk bastard. | Pokemon after Misty left üòÇ | BBC Top Gear. | House of Cards was done once Kevin Spacey was gone. | That 70s Show | Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman sucked after Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman left. | Once Upon A Time | Most recently I‚Äôd say the Witcher series. | The UK Being Human. First Mitchell left, then George, and finally Annie. The last season was a whole new cast that wasn‚Äôt awful but they weren‚Äôt as good as the original | Shameless | Shameless, after the departure of Emma Rossum. | Pair of Kings just wasn't the same without Mitchel Musso. | Charmed after Shannen left, GOT after Tywin was killed (slow death) | Almost all original squad from misfits (season 1/2) | Shameless after Emmy Rossum left. It just wasn't the same. | Suits, House of Cards, The Office | Trailer Park Boys after Jim Lahey ( John D ) | The Witcher and Henry Cavill. It's not done yet, but let us see the showwriters riding it all the way into it's grave. | The Witcher. Actually, it failed for many other reasons, but without Henry Cavill, it was on life support. The producers were so full of themselves.¬† | The Witcher season 4 (inevitably) | Shameless when Emmy Rossum left. It‚Äôs understandable, apparently she was pretty insufferable on set. Such a good actress though. | When Phil Hartman was killed, News Radio was not the same afterwards. | Two and a half man without Charlie Sheen | Mandelorian. | Firefly- the entire cast .....I still miss it | Two and a half Men, without Charlie Sheen. Just not the same. | Family Guy and Cleveland Show. After Seth McFarlane leaves to work on Ted, those shows went downhill. Family Guy went from being really funny to very serious and dramatic, boring ass jokes and cutaways, even if the jokes were funny nobody would laugh because the topic of the episode is really serious. Cleveland show just got boring with the jokes, and they were about to head into the direction Family Guy was at but ratings killed it before that happened. | Top Gear when Clarkson, Hammond and May left. | The Witcher | El chavo del ocho | The Andy Griffith Show when Barney left | I wasn't very happy the last 2 seasons of Stargate SG-1 | Wings, when Lowell left. Never had a chance | House of Cards fell off so bad after Kevin Spacey.¬† | I wouldn‚Äôt say failed but when Shannon Doherty left 90210 it wasn‚Äôt as great. maybe a season or two after, as I thought Tiffany Amber Thiessen was a good replacement but ‚Ä¶ show died pretty much after | Good Times | House of cards‚Ä¶. | Joey leaps to mind. | MASH, after MacLean Stephenson left.  Just unwatchable 

J/k | I heard TJ Miller is a menace in real life but Silicon Valley started going downhill after Erlich was ousted | Always Sunny when Dennis left (for the one episode where they replaced him with a sex doll).

But for real that might be the worst episode. | That 70‚Äôs Show. Jumped the shark then got eaten by it. | I think Ashton Kutcher is a fantastic actor, but Charlie Sheen was irreplaceable on Two and a Half Men | House of Cards | Northern Exposure after Dr. Fleischman left. | The Office | When Richard Coyle left Coupling (U.K.). They gave it an honest 4th season but it was too much. If you like comedy about adult (sex) themes, it is a funny show. | That 70‚Äôs show | Two and a half men was worse without Charlie Sheen. Which really means something because it already sucked ass with his drunk ass for a couple of seasons. | The X-Files | Witcher | The office. | Vikings after Ragnar and Ecbert | NCIS after Abby left | The Office after Steve Carell left | The Office after Steve left | Three's Company | When Steve Carrell left The Office US. If I rewatch the series, I never watched the later episodes. I treat his leaving the actual finale of the show. | AHS after Jessica Lange | Rizzoli and isles after Lee Thompson young died | Stargate SG-1 after Richard Dean Anderson left. The show should have ended after season 8 and had Mitchell and Vala be in a spinoff show. But RDA was the glue that held the SG1 team together and without him it was okay but it lost the magic | Air wolf season 3 without Jan Michael Vincent is  unwatchable | Altered Carbon was pretty bad after Joel Kinnaman left. | Witcher. Cavill left and left because of the stupid shit they were doing to the script/story.  They were like - FU, we can get any tall dude willing to wear a white wig.  That didn't end like they wanted it to | When ron Howard left happy days. First up they focused on Joanie and chatchie ,.. they were stupid enough to think that they could sustain their own spin off. So they also leave the show. Meanwhile we get a new teach played by Jefferson Darcy from married with children, they focus more of the love life of fonz and also him adopting a young kid. J&C return with their tv failure and the show stumbles all the way to the end. So much so they wrote off potsie and didn‚Äôt even feature him in the finale. | House of card, despite all the scandal, lost a lot | The Office | The Golden Girls‚Äî when Dorthy left. | Hate to say it, but Kevin Spacey in House of Cards | Suits, tho the rest of the cast was great, it still died and the spinoffs failed | Andy Griffith show. The color episodes were shit with no Barney Fife. | That 70s Show when Eric and Kelso left the show | Roseanne | Grey's anatomy. I loved it but once Derek and Cristina left well you know | Smallville after Michael Rosenbaum dipped out. Wasn't the same without Lex in it (off-screen). | Game of thrones started to go downhill ever since they killed off Charles Dance's character IMO. | CSI after Grissom left | Plebs, when the Stylax left it just tanked. | That 70s show. Wasn't the same without topher | Two and a half men. | Earth: Final Conflict pretty much went downhill after season 1 and the change in the lead. Kincaid isn‚Äôt anywhere near as likable as Boone | House of cards. Last season was terrible | When they killed off West World in West World. The show basically made it a convoluted mess after season 1. Should have really expanded upon an operational west world over multiple seasons. It basically had nothing to do with the west soon after that. | Topher Grace, That 70s Show. | The X-Files after Duchovny left | Top Gear | ncis. it's not the same show without gibbs and tony :( | Community and Dan Harmon. Proved further by it being good again when he came back. | Office and Steve carrell- just wasn‚Äôt the same | The X files after Mulder left | House of Cards. It was absolute shit when Spacey was forced out. | News Radio.  It wasn't the same without Phil Hartman | NewsRadio was hilarious before Hartman got killed. | House M.D. after Drs. Chase, Cameron, and Foreman left. I never really cared what happened to the other characters after they left. | Pretty much every show Bryan Fuller started and left. | Tarak Mehta ka ooltah chashma just got boring after daya left the show. | House of Cards. Spacey fucked up, but goddamn if he isn't the absolute best actor of his generation. They need to let that dude back in to the Hollywood club. He's made amends and admitted fault, let's fucking go. | The Office. While it was not a total failure after Steve Carell left, it just wasn‚Äôt the same. The show still lasted a couple more seasons because the supporting cast was strong, but I‚Äôm sure it could have gone on longer if he had stayed | House of cards after Kevin Spacey left. | The Office was never as good when Steve Carell left the show | Community after Donald Glover left the show. | Dukes of Jazard....Im  old but when they replaced the Duke boys with their cousins. I was like ten years old and remember being really upset | Rosanne | That 70s show. Once Eric left, it all fell apart. Kelso being a ghost for half the season didn't help either | 2 and a half men. 

After Charlie Sheen left, it was over. | The witcher | Do I need to say it? *The Office* after Michael left. | Top gear after clarkson, Hammond and May got fired lol | Rosanne | The Chi after the actor that played Brandon got dismissed for misconduct against his colleague. She left too actually. | The office | Community, after Donald Glover left. | We'll see that with the new Witcher season lol. Although the 3rd season was already quite the disappointment. | Scrubs. | Walking dead after losing Rick 

It‚Äôs just not the type of show that can go on without its lead as it has no defined end goal story-wise. So the end goal becomes seeing where our main character goes. Oh, he‚Äôs gone now? Then what‚Äôs the point? If they wanted it to work Rick had to be part of a larger story that went on without him and they weren‚Äôt able to pull that off. | Game of thrones after the books left | Most would say Steve Carrell leaving The Office. It was a notable change, but there were still some great episodes post Michael. | two and a half men. | Impractical jokers when Joe left. Saddest thing in TV history | Yellowstone and Costner | two and a Half Men | Big bang theory when fun left the show | 8 out of 10 cats just doesn't seem to work for me since Sean Lock passed | CSI. First Warwick.  Then Grissom and then Willows. I know they things going on in real life,  but the replacements with their individual star power still couldn't bring the original magic back. Even when Grissom came back, i tried. Just couldn't. | Season 2 of Twin Peaks after David Lynch left | _Top Gear_. | Two and a Half Men | Northern exposure.   Fleishman left and it died!! | Community (Donald glover and yvette nicole brown) | Alias. When Jennifer Garner‚Äôs career took off, the show basically folded as she moved on. | For a more recent example, I couldn't finish Shogun after they killed off Mariko. | I feel like Doctor Who is deader than dead. They lost the legacy fans and made some bad calls with choices in Doctor. I remember when it was cool to like new who, now it‚Äôs just straight embarrassing to be caught dead anywhere near it. | While I've only watched clips of it on YT and not the show itself, I wanna say 2 and a Half Men after Charlie Sheen left. Even from the clips I preferred the Charlie Sheen era. | Two and a Half Men | House of Cards | Witcher 3 by looks of Cavill leaving | Community. | 2,5 men | Roseanne | Two and a Half Men comes first on the list. | Lethal Weapon. Fucking Damon Wayons should have gotten the boot instead of Crawford. | Reign and The 100 | The office | Daily show, oh wait thats in 2 months when jon stewart leaves | Two and a half men. | The Office when Michael Scott left | Community 

You know it.

Never would‚Äôve thought Troy was that essential to the quality of laughs, but he was | Roseanne | I feel like every companion after The Ponds and The Eleventh Doctor in Doctor Who have been lacking.

Clara was a great one but her tenure was a bit shadowed by being right after them at the time.

But everyone beyond her has just never that same spark of mad magic as Matt Smith, Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill. | Community kinda sucked after Troy left | Not show, but movie. Harry Potter wasn‚Äôt the same after the original Dumbledore passed away. | The Office after Michael left | The Blacklist once Megan Boone left | The office Steve Carell | I wouldn‚Äôt say failed, but the quality dropped significantly and it was obvious - THE OFFICE. Steve Carrell was the heart of that show, and when he left, they floundered, trying to replace him and prop up the show with guest stars like Will Ferrell and Kathy Bates, who both were abysmal on the show, IMO. 

They honestly should have ended the show after Carrell left. The writers clearly had no idea what to do with the show when he exited to be in more films. | The office after Steve left. | I'd say The Office.

When Michael (Steve Carrell) left the show it tanked so hard for me, Steve Carrell was half of that show | The office is the answer. | The moment they beheaded Ned Stark. 

It all went to shit the moment Ned's head hit the dirt. | The Office struggled after Steve Carell left | The Office is dead the moment Michael leaves the show. There are a few nice moments, but the show takes a pretty big dive without him around. | MASH was a complete and utter failure once Trapper and Blake left. 

* Because Alda thought it was all about him. | Step Up: High Water

I know it technically is a flop but it got worse when they replaced Naya Rivera after her heroic death

Also like neither of the two main characters from season 1 are in the third season | Older show. But when Abby Fairgate Cunningham Ewing Sumner left Knots Landing the show lost it's spark. They tried to replace many ""Abby"" like characters but it was useless. Donna Mills was the best Villianess‚ù§Ô∏è | I don‚Äôt think it failed completely but when Beth (Gretchen Corbett) left the Rockford Files in season 4 that was a big loss for me. I loved her and Rockford‚Äôs chemistry. Season 5-6 are okay, but it doesn‚Äôt feel quite as strong. | I know a greman one that is called ""Wetten dass"" with Thomas Gottschalk | House of Cards | Misfits when Robert sheehan left | Shameless | Newsradio. After Phil Hartman was murdered that show never recovered. | That 70's Show...

Not NCIS though... Makes me wonder if they killed off a main character so early just to test the trend.

And then there's 24, where they killed off an important character early to be different, and then just killed off basically everyone every season heh. | Wentworth..
I don‚Äôt think it failed but I stopped watching Wentworth after Bea left üò≠ | The OC | Nina Dobrev Vampire diaries | New York Undercover when Michael DeLorenzo‚Äôs character was killed. | When Dr. Shepard left Grey‚Äôs Anatomy, I was done. Haven‚Äôt seen an episode since his death. | Total Drama was a good series to turn the brain off to until they went in the direction of Amazing Race and got rid of Chris. | Sandman will once ordinary people read about the women's claims.

It's a tragedy as the acting and writing is excellent.

But we do see Gaiman in it. | Unfortunately after the main character passed away  Spartacus was never the same. | That 70's show and the Office come to mind however it was after they had a long successful run before hand so it didn't feel like a failure. | I think Community started to get really lame after Donald Glover left | Hate to say it Charlie Sheen in Two and half men.. it was passable with sheen but horrible after. | It had a successful run - but it was a big mistake to try to keep Scrubs going when Zach Braff left | Cold feet after Rachel. When they did the reboot it was crap. | The Witcher ‚Ä¶ soon | Who would of thunk it, but Topher Grace (Eric) leaving that 70‚Äôs show killed the story. | Donald glover leaving community. It was never the same after he left. | 2 1/2 men | Community. 5+6 have some good gags, but the soul was clearly gone. | I assumed, by *show*, you meant *concert*. Was trying to recall when a lead singer walked off a stage, causing a show to be cancelled‚Ä¶ | The Walking Dead when Rick left... | The Witcher | Moms | Sleepy Hallow 

I stopped watching when they killed off Abby (Nicole Beharie)

The show runners did Nicole dirty 

Jokes on them though, the show died the next season.

Good show, good chemistry, good writing until the last 2 seasons. | Silicon Valley failed when T.J. Miller got axed. | Handmaid‚Äôs Tale was really impacted by Alexis Bledel‚Äôs sudden departure, they had to change s5 significantly to its deficit. | Walking dead because Grimes left and they got reedus to take over | I can‚Äôt watch walking dead without Andrew Lincoln | Two and a half men after they kicked out Charlie Sheen | 2and a half men. Charlie was in his winning phase | Community wasn't the same after Donald glover was the first to leave. It was a funny show that just lost its cohesiveness when everyone followed suit | I've seen maybe three of these shows | I'd be hard pressed to find someone say this, but Pair of Kings just wasn't the same without Mitchel Musso. | spartacus after the main guy died from cancer. | Two and a Half Men after Charlie Sheen left. Ashton Kutcher was a poor replacement. | 2 and a half men | Two hand a half men, it was such a great sitcom. With waldon it sucked in so many ways. yes Charlie got fired and was an asshole. But stop the show, dont try to Milk a dead cow(which they did) | Impractical Jokers for me. I miss the dynamic when Joe was on. | Two and a half men‚Ä¶ Charlie was the heart and soul | The last season of coupling really fell off without (male) Jeff | Scrubs - Zach Brafg | Spartacus when the lead passed away | House of Cards. | Don Knotts on The Andy Griffith Show | 2 and a half men | That 70s Show tanked when Topher Grace left. | Two and a half Men. Charlie Sheen. The episodes were never the same. | Two and half men. Charley Sheen left the show and it was never the same again. | Two and a half men, That 70s Show, Impractical Jokers, House of Cards | Wayward pines, I think the majority of the 1st season cast only signed up for a single season and none returned for the second season. The second season followed a bunch of teenage fascist characters and then I stopped watching it... | Two And A Half Men after Charlie Sheen left | That 70s Show. Eric left it was Just painful. | Top Gear, never was anywhere near as good without Clarkson, Hammond and May. Even though Clarkson is a bit insufferable | Let's go with an oldie. Battlestar Galactica 1980 aka old BSG season 2 for the most part.

Long story short, Galactica finds Earth. It's Earth in the year 1980. What does the crew of Galactica try and do? Seed their technology and try and uplift us before the Cylons show up.

Only a massive chunk of the cast is gone. Apolo? Gone. Starbuck? Shows up in one episode and gets a sorta downer ending. You still have Adama and Ty. Now you have a whole new cast, Adama always talking with a 14 year old super genius. On and Galactica super kids. No really kids with super powers due to being in space.

Yeah there's more to Galactica 1980 that made it fail. But barely any of the old cast coming back I tend to think is reason 1. | That 70s show when topher grace left | Two and a half men | Rhoatl‚Ä¶nene was the show | Top Gear | Top gear | Sliders definitely went well downhill story wise when the professor was killed off. | RWBY, though its creator had died early, not left. | House of Cards, I still haven't watched the final season, pointless without Spacey. | That 70's Show | House of Cards spectacularly imploded with the departure of Kevin spacey. | Scrubs trying to continue after JD was just weird.

And I'm happy for Kal Penn getting to work in Obama's white house. That's cool. But killing Kutner was lame and House really struggled afterwards. | It didn‚Äôt fail but Spartacus wasn‚Äôt the same after season 1 guy died.  I still enjoyed it but if he had left and not died I don‚Äôt know if it would have survived. | House of Cards. Literally. | 2.5 Men | It didn't fail, but it sucked when TJ Miller left Silicon Valley. He really worked well with the main character. | Community was never the same after Dan Harmon left. Even when he came back | Hasn‚Äôt happened yet but Yellowstone will die with Kevin Costner leaving. Charlie sheen leaving 2.5 men killed it. | Two and a Half Men

The Office- kinda 

That 70s Sjow | On the Buses really fell part after Reg Varney left. He held the show together. | unpopular opinion: Misfits (2009-2013). Robert Sheehan (Nathan) left after season 2. He was the most annoying character, but after he left, the show went south.... | Scrubs. | James, Richard and Jeremy with Top Gear | The Mick literally failed because Sofia Black-D'Elia left, does that count? | House of Cards... you know who. | The Girls Next Door.

I went on a reality show binge over the last few months, and watching the very obvious drop in quality on the show, piqued my curiosity. 

Bridget and Holly drove the show in a lot of ways. Heff and the director of the show felt like the show could go on without them.

For various reasons, all three girls (Holly, Bridget and Kendra) left the show, almost at once. The fifth season ended fairly abruptly, and it was obvious that there was tension and scrambling to create a storyline that maintained the show's ""wholesome but sexy,"" image.

The sixth season starts with 3 new girlfriends, and tries to continue on as if nothing ever happened.

2 of the new girlfriends are twin sisters, which makes it incesty and uncomfortable for a lot of people. It was also strange and uncanny when the show tried to copy and paste storylines and character traits. 

Holly had a routine where she would wake up and bring her dogs to the office and hang out with Heffs secretary, Mary. This came off as organic and part of her day, especially since she became more involved with working on the magazine. 

In the first episode of season six, copy and paste, Krystal wakes up and explains how she goes to sit with Mary every morning and brings the dog with her. It was just so forced. E's highest grossing reality show (at the time) completely bombed and went down in flames, because Heff believed that people were watching only to see him, and refused to see that the girls were what made the show. You can't just plop in 3 new characters and pick up where the old ones left off. 

Plus, at his age and with his idiosyncrasies, he wasn't that fun or interesting to watch. | Impractical Jokers after Joe left | I predict Yellowstone when Costner leaves | The vampire diaries went downhill after Nina Dobrev (THE MAIN CHARACTER) left | Saved By The Bell without Kelly Kapowski is the drizzling shits. | When Aaron left Gas Monkey Garage | Community once Donald Glover left | The Ranch after they fired Danny Masterson. I don't know how long they intended to run the show, but it definitely went downhill and was cancelled shortly after. | Game of Thrones after Lyanna Mormont died | The witcher is about to. | Death Note, killed off the most interesting character. It‚Äôs as if they killed off Batman and have Robin and batgirl try to replace him. | Community, twice. The first decline was when Chase then second when Glover left the show. At which point it was unwatchable! | The kominsky method shit the bed season 3 when Alan arkan left | Witcher. | Game Of Thrones after Charles Dance. They should have put him as a ghost in every scene involving his descendants. | Rob and Big. Big had a baby and left to be a dad. Good on him, still sad. | Will call it in advance : Netflix's The Witcher | Impractical Jokers after Joe left | The Kapil Sharma Show when Sunil Grover left | The OC after they killed off Marissa. | Spoiler: the Witcher is cooked af without Cavill. | Clayne Crawford, Lethal Weapon (2016) | Misfits | When Reggie Theus was replaced by Dick Butkus on Hang Time | Forged in fire- why did the host leave? | House of Cards after they dropped Spacey | Tmkoc | Top GearxD 
It died for me when the big Three left. | Vampire Diaries | 
I love the ranch, the characters and everything are amazing. With the whole rooster/whatever that bearded guy‚Äôs name was that was on trial for Scientology and rape thing, they abruptly took him out of the show by having him be in a motorcycle wreck and falling off a cliff, but you never saw it. He was just gone. They replaced him with Dax Shepard, who is fine in his own right, but it was too weird of a switchto completely follow without concerns and questions, but, I get it | The witcher | Westworld after season 2. Way too many characters were gone suddenly. It almost felt like a different show outside of the amusement park¬† | Two and a Half man. | Future prediction.. The Witcher season 4. | The Vampire Diaries...after Nina Dobrev(Elena) left the show ..it went rapidly downhill. | The chi | Leyla ile Mecnun after Ezgi Asaroglu and Ushan √áakƒ±r left was never the same. | Spartacus: Blood and sand | How has Jeremy Clarkson and Top Gear not been mentioned? | The witcher | Two and a Half Men

That 70s Show | two and a half men...Charlie Sheen was that show | Two and a half men once Charlie Sheen left | Sliders went downhill after the professor left.

It went off the edge of flat earth after Jerry left. | Shameless us | The Witcher, Henry Cavill | One that comes to mind is *That '70s Show* after Topher Grace (Eric) and Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) left. The show just wasn‚Äôt the same without them, especially Eric, who was basically the heart of the group. The dynamic felt off, and the new characters didn‚Äôt really click with the audience. It‚Äôs like the show lost its magic, and the final season really struggled because of it. | 2 and a half men | House MD after 13 left | Two and a half men? I've not seen a single episode with Kutcher. | 1000% top gear JC got kicked off and it was over soon after. Not TGT is ending on my Bday this week and idk how I‚Äôll ever get over it. | House of cards | Glenn | Blue mountain state had to change the whole story after season one because Sam Jones got caught selling drugs and was arrested. He was the co star and just disappeared | Two and a half men | Itchy and scratchy was never the same after poochy left. | That 70s show | The Witcher | It's gotta be The Office. | two and a half men | The OC when they killed off Marissa | the Office | Most people would tell you American Horror Story went belly up after Jessica Lange departed. I personally loved Hotel though. | Not failed, but Impractical Jokers isn't the same without Joe | American horror story after a bunch of the original actors left. Evan peters, Sarah Paulson, Jessica lange. | I know he's a plonker, but Top Gear was never the same after Clarkson left | House of cards. | Two and a Half Men without Charlie Sheen was a shell of its former self | Suits. Downtown abbey. I still love the show, but Matthew was needed. | 2 and a half men after Charlie Sheen left, it turned into a Nickelodeon show. | That 70s Show when Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher left | Two and a Half Men didn‚Äôt seem as popular when Charlie Sheen left. | The Wheel of Time after Matt walked off the set. I'm pretty bitter about this | Transparent. When Jeffrey Tambor was ousted they had to cancel the show. It really couldn't go on without his character. Such a shame | How has no one mentioned Sex and the City And Just Like That, after Kim Cattral left! | How has no one mentioned Sex and the City And Just Like That, was never the same after Kim Cattral left! | Scrubs when Zach Braff left. | The Simpson after Roy left | Person of Interest | plebs | Mock the week once Frankie Boyle left. It became painfully unfunny. | Three's Company without Suzanne Somers. | Narcos after Pablo dies. | Wow. No one mentioned ""Chico and the Man"". The most horrible case of a show going sour due to an actor... well... leaving. | SUITS. Curses.......... | SILICON VALLEY SPOILERS BELOW!


Not entirely relevant to the question, but always wondered how Silicon Valley's entire story had to have been changed because Peter Gregory left. | Yellowstone is the most obvious lol | Andromeda sucked after the original showrunner left. Kevin Sorbo is an asshole | Lost, actually, I don't think it was one character leaving, just the storyline divergence from the original story. Things just kept getting wierder as time went on: Smoke Monster, the continuing addition of new people, new plots, everything. The writers should have stayed with the original story. | Reaper (2007), the one with Ray Wise playing the Devil. The lead, Brett Harrison asked for more money and left when they said no, and they cancelled the show. It ended on a fucking cliffhanger. | Chrissie Three's Company | The Office. | Forecasting the future - Yellowstone. | The Office post-Michael Scott was not the same. | No one is interested in the Witcher now that Cavill is leaving.  Including me. | It wasn‚Äôt bad, but in The Expanse, the actor who plays Alex got canned because of bad behavior, so they killed off the character before the last season. 

It‚Äôs based on books, so that was a bummer. It also kind of kills the chance of them picking it back up later to cover the events in the second half of the novels. Also his character in the books was just a good guy, kind of the heart of the group, so it was disappointing to learn the actor was a scumbag. | ***The Hogan Family***¬†(originally titled¬†***Valerie***¬†and later¬†***Valerie's Family: The Hogans***) | The OC was a disaster after Mischa Barton left. | shameless !!!!!!!!!!!! | Good Times after John Amos left | The Office post Steve Carell. | Mom | The price is right! | Fear the Walking Dead went totally downhill after >!Nick's!<death. | Shameless after Fiona ([Emmy Rossum](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=8b98dd0f836117fc&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS975US976&sxsrf=ADLYWIIZBs2_e1nAyFXdIWu97Q8Uq-17HQ:1725974996964&q=Emmy+Rossum&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLUz9U3MDFPL095xGjCLfDyxz1hKe1Ja05eY1Tl4grOyC93zSvJLKkUEudig7J4pbi5ELp4FrFyu-bmVioE5RcXl-YCAO7DNdxSAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjp9db0vbiIAxWmKkQIHc1VChcQzIcDKAB6BAhJEAE)) left. | Two and a Half Men after Charlie Sheen left. His exit led to a significant drop in ratings and a noticeable change in the show's tone and success. | Money heist after Berlin died | Failed is a bit harsh, but The Waltons suffered when John Boy (Richard Thomas) left. | 2 and a half men, Charlie Sheen. | Greys anatomy because Derek left | Beauty and the Beast 1987. Linda Hamilton (who played Catherine Chandler in the series) left the show as she was pregnant with her son Dalton at the time. She'd had a miscarriage while filming another episode and didn't want to take a chance of something happening to her baby this time. At the beginning of season 3 Catherine was killed off, and fans still aren't happy about that today. The interesting thing is, Linda Hamilton had an identical twin sister, Leslie, who was Linda's stunt double on the show. Witt Thomas could have recast Leslie as Catherine, maybe explaining that she had some kind of plastic surgery while in witness protection (Catherine was a wealthy attorney, the story in the first episode of season 3 was Catherine was kidnapped after becoming pregnant with Vincent's son) to explain any slight differences in appearance between Linda and Leslie. | The office wasn‚Äôt the same after Steve Carrell left. Especially in the season where they put Andy in charge. | Now I wouldn‚Äôt say it was a total fail and there were good moments but shameless went downhill after Emmy rossum left | Andy Griffith | Strike Back after Damien and Michael left. The first season (origins) with Richard Armitage was decent but had a low budget. Seasons 2-5 with Scott and Stonebridge were awesome. Season 6-8 brought in a new cast and it wasn‚Äôt the same. The two main leads were ok but didn‚Äôt have the same chemistry as Scott and Stonebridge | Vikings | SPARTACUS, | Since no one has said it - Charlie‚Äôs Angels - Farrah Fawcett left first. | I don‚Äôt know much about the circumstances (remember hearing it was pay related?), but Silicon Valley just wasn‚Äôt the same after T.J.

They tried to replace him with Dick Van Dyke in the final season, but Dick Van Dyke quit after a few episodes because it just wasn‚Äôt working. | House of Cards. | The show Mom.

Danny Masterson ""The Ranch"". Yes, he is a horrible person.

While it didn't really fail, and actually lasted a few more seasons after Charlie Sheen was booted and replaced by Ashton Kutcher, it felt like a completely different show. | Surprised nobody mentioned Rob Lowe from west wing.   The show was still good, but no longer great after he left. | Once Upon a Time. They tried to continue without Jennifer Morrison, but it just completly crumpled. | Smalllville when Lex left.

The show got canceled. | Northern Exposure when Fleischman left. Rob Morrow tried to renegotiate his contract and they wrote him out. Absolutely killed the show and it ended after that awful season. It was such a great fucking show. | Justin Roiland from Rick and Morty.

Hands down! 

When The Wayans family left their own show. The network scrambled for replacements and got Biz Markie, Chris Rock and some others. 

Nothing was more weird than that. | Suits | Sleepy Hollow | Top Gear. | Top Gear after Jeremy Clarkson left; and his colleagues followed. | Superstore | Felicity when her hair left | House of Cards | *House of Cards*.

- House of Cards post Kevin Spacey | 2 1/2 Men | Going way back but Spin City without Michael J. Fox | The OC after Marissa Cooper died | Jane the Virgin after they killed off Michael. Whenever I do a rewatch, I only watch until his death. 

I‚Äôm Team Michael, though, so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs different for people that are Team Rafael lol | I think The Office and Two and Half Men really went downhill the last couple seasons without Steve Carell and Charlie Sheen, respectively. | The Royal Family after Redd Foxx passed | Game of thrones after the books left | Riverdale after Archie dad unfortunately passed | The Office took a dive when Steve Carell left. 
Northern Exposure also sucked after Rob Morrow left. | The Ranch | Pair of kings. When Brady left | It's the old ""Ted McGinley Theory"" . https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna4549382

See, he was the actor that suddenly replaced main characters on many shows...Happy Days, The Love Boat, Married With Children. He's not a bad actor or anything, but a career heavy in becoming a star replacement solidified this reputation: 

""Here's the case against him. For his very first TV job, Ted joined ""Happy Days"" when star Ron Howard left after a salary dispute. Hein says the comedy went downhill fast. Ted then dropped anchor on ""The Love Boat,"" playing the ship's photographer, Ace. Soon, Hein points out, the show fell from the top 20, to number 56 in the ratings. And soon could no longer be found in your local listings. Ted then landed on ""Married with Children,"" as the new husband of next-door neighbor Marci. Hein says the sitcom's quality fell sharply, and then it too went off the air. Then, like a kind of Typhoid Mary of bad ratings, Ted showed up on ""The Practice"" in 2001, as a main character's sperm donor.

Two seasons later, ratings were down and half the cast was fired.""

To be completely fair, he didn't necessarily kill those shows and some persisted for several more seasons..but he always appeared *after* they jumped the shark. In the case of Happy Days, *literally*. | The whole Tech TV Channel after Olivia Munn realized it was getting out dated. | Mom after Anna Faris left | ""Ellen"", the 90s sitcom, sucked when they killed off the titular character's raging horniness for handsome men, which was sort of a central focus and felt like a character in itself. It was a pretty progressive show for showing that women can be horny and want intimacy, but then they did a complete heel turn into ""she's gay and coping with discovering that"" and the main sort of through line of the show was just gone. I get that there was no representation in the 90s, but it was just ham-handed. | Harlots | The golden palace. Bea Arthur wanted to leave the golden girls, which is why that ended at 7 seasons. They tried continuing without her, but it wasn‚Äôt the same, which is why it was 1 season. | Master of None | The Office (US) was never the same after Steve Carell left | I pretend like the following seasons after Michael Scott/ Steve Carrel left the Office don‚Äôt exist. Never seen a show take a bigger nose dive. | Community- Troy's departure ruins it all for me | News Radio

That 70s Show

Two and a Half Men | Mike Scott left The Office | Dexter after season 4 and the original showrunner left. Luckily, he designed season 4 like a series finale, so you can just stop there and have a great viewing experience | The OC | Seinfeld, when Larry David left....Fizzle..... | Post Matt Smith Dr.Who. I liked Eccleston, Tennant and Smith, and lost all interest when it changed to Capaldi. | That 70‚Äôs show after Eric left | Two and a Half Men | 90210 when most of the original cast left | House of Cards. | I kept on scrolling, how come the Office is not mentioned already? | House of cards. | The OC after Marisa (Mischa Burton) dies end of third season.¬†


Mischa's career plunged after that also. | Community after they fired Chevy | The Vampire Diaries when Elena left.. I mean the whole show was about her.. and her diaries.. | Two and a half man after Charlie Sheen got fired. Was not the same. | When Andy Samberg left [Cuckoo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2222352/). It was a show kind of like Pauly Shore's 'Son-In-Law' where a bozo follows the daughter home, and bonus, it had the best father-in-law character. But when the title character leaves after the first season, the show has a problem. It still had Greg Davies so it held on a while longer, but it just never really recovered. | The Office after Micheal left | Don't get me wrong, Community is a fantastic show for every season (bar 4), but Troy leaving was really felt for the rest of the seasons. | A great example from the 2000s is **""**The West Wing"" | The Witcher. Henry Cavill was irreplaceable as Geralt | House of Cards | The Office never felt the same after Steve Carell left. For me, HE is The Office | My Hero after Ardql O‚Äôhannolan left, James Dreyfus wasn‚Äôt an adequate replacement. | Squibillies. Tracy Morgan as Early? Really? 

Really? | News Radio‚Ä¶ | i know some people love the whole show but the office without steve carrell is a completely different vibe and i stopped at the end of the first season he left | 2 and a half men, yes Charlie sheen imploded but that show was awful after he left | Future tense I think the Witcher will | The flash was still bad even when he left, but once Carlos Valdes Left, the actor who played Cisco, the show took a bad shift. | The office without Steve. | Community failed when Donald Glover left | Not saying it was great before, but Henry Cavill just left ‚ÄúThe Witcher‚Äù and I‚Äôd be surprised if the new season wasn‚Äôt absolutely dog tbh | The Office wasn‚Äôt the same after Steve Carell left. | I‚Äôm not sure if this counts, but Death Note. After L is written off the show turned horrid. | Silicon valley without TjMiller | Cum Town.¬† | The Ranch | # Jonathan Taylor Thomas - Show ended pretty quick after he left. | Shocked I haven‚Äôt seen the office. I still enjoyed the show but quality went way down after Steve Carell left | Two and a half men | Hasn‚Äôt happened yet but probably the Witcher. | The Ranch. I thought overall the show was still solid , but felt off and different after Hyde left . | The Office (US) without Michael Scott | S | Definitely Greys anatomy | Does Ragnar dying count as ""leaving the show""? Because Vikings was never the same without Ragnar.

I don't know about ""failed"", but Spartacus was never really the same when Andy Whitfield died of cancer. Not a bad replacement though. | That 70‚Äôs show went downhill after Eric Foreman left. | greys anatomy because everyone dies | the office died for me when steve carell left.. | I wouldn‚Äôt say The Office (US) failed after Steve Carrell left, but it deff got really shitty before ending. The final season basically undid a lot of character development for Andy (which can be attributed to Ed Helms having other projects) and forced drama between Pam and Jim just so it could cross the finish line it felt like. | Smallville once Lex Luther left. | The office. When Michael Scott left | Jeremy clarkson. Top gear | I had a hard time enjoying House after the main three Watsons left the show or their role as House‚Äôs Watson | Greys after Derek died | Good times. Not sure if that will resonate here tho. | Great British Bake Off after Sue, Mel and Mary left. 

Paul Hollywood is a douchebag (""it's underprooooooved"") and Matt Lucas makes weird jokes about food. | House of Cards. Spacey played the character so well. Just wasn‚Äôt the same after he was outed. | 

The first season of The Walking Dead was absolutely massive thanks to the directing of Frank Darabont. Probably one of the biggest moments in Television history. But AMC decided to save a few bucks and remove him essentially sending the show on a downward spiral. 

At least he got $200 Million and future royalties via a settlement from AMC, but it's hard to not imagine what kind of show TWD could have been with him still directing it. | Suits, it lost its luster once mike left, just didn't have the same energy thar mike and harvey made. | Ted Lasso didn‚Äôt fail, but it lost something significant when Bill Lawrence departed. The second and especially the third seasons didn‚Äôt match up to the first at all. | Sleepy hollow | Pierce and then Troy from Community. I know everyone hates Pierce, but he was a necessary villain imo. He was like an always sunny character got accidentally put into a good hearted show. | Archer after Jessica Walter died. Granted, the show only went on for a season or 2 after, but Mallory‚Äôs presence was too big to be written around. | Impractical jokers | The magicians üò§ they killed off our Q | It didn‚Äôt fail, but it definitely got worse with season 7. I hate to say it but‚Ä¶

Rick and Morty | Top Gear | Game of Thrones. As soon as Tywin Lannister is gone the whole thing lacked his gravitas holding it together.

All of my favorite scenes from the early seasons have him in it. | My So-Called Life | fresh beat band | Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni) from SVU.
Oh wait, ITS STILL GOING? Fucking why? | Glee after they had to kill off Finn. RIP Cory. | Game of thrones when Jack Gleason and Charles dance left | House of cards was coming out right as the allegations against kevin spacey were. Netflix cut ties with him pretty immediately and tried to continue the show with robin wright, who is a good actress dont get me wrong, but kevin spacey is an amazing actor despite being a horrible person and it didnt last. After a season they cut their losses. | Top gear | ‚ÄúPower‚Äù was never great but it became truly awful when they killed off Angela. | community got distinctly less good when donald glover left | Roseanne | The Office - Michael | Even though he is a despicable human being, House of Cards was rubbish without Spacey. | The office after Michael Scott. | The office. Michael Scott. | The Office after Steve Carell left | The blacklist with Elizabeth left | The office when Michael left | Suits since Rachel left | Even though it ran its course, I think the Big Bang Theory failed when the plot decided to leave the show in season 2.¬† | Cumtown¬† | Auz | The Office felt radically different after Steve Carell left. | The Office | The Office (US) was not as good after Michael left. Somehow it dragged on for 4 more seasons (I think?) | The office | The office. Wasn't the same when michael left | News Radio when Phil left.... | The office. Was awful after Steve Carrell left | The Office | US office | The Office once Steve Carrell said ‚Äúsayonara‚Äù

God was that show bad afterwards. | The office, two and a half men | The Office | It didn‚Äôt fail, but Silicon Valley was not the same without TJ Miller | The Office after Carrell left | I think the office (us) counts atleast in terms of viewership. Writing/quality wise it was still okay during the early s8 Andy arc but by season 9 it can screw off.


Failed is a bit of a stretch here but Skins (UK) lost a lot of it's charm after S3. Some do love and prefer the new characters though so meh. | I am surprised nobody has said The Office (US) yet. That was one of the most direct fall-offs in quality I've seen. | The office | The (American) Office | The Office limped along without Steve Carrell. Not a knock on the other talent on the show, but he was the key ingredient that made it all work. | when Steve Carrell left the Office.  I tried to keep watching but I couldn't stand the new guy | Consider the television series Scrubs. The egress of Zach Braff (J.D.) in the eighth installment in a way changed the dynamics of the show. Although they introduced different characters and changes in the humor, scar and heart of the show, it was not so effective without his presence. It‚Äôs funny how in some instances, a show runs out of steam when a main character is no longer part of it. | office (us) went south after steve carell left. not sure if the only reason but it was doomed for sure | The Office (US) after Steve Carrell quit. | Silicon Valley really suffered after TJ Miller got himself kicked off the show | Game of thrones after  G rr Martin left | Game of Thrones when the author quit amiright | Fantastic beasts.

Not even worth watching without Jhonny. | Umbrella Academy when Ellen Page left. | Seinfeld | The Vampire Diaries when Elena left.

The Blacklist when Liz left because Red was left to carry the show alone. | that moment when a character leaves and the whole vibe just crashes kinda like when they change the actor for no reason. so awkward | The Democrat party when Biden left and was replaced by Kamala.  Biggest downgrade since Craig Ferguson left the late late show and was replaced by James corden. | dude remember when everyone was bummed when that one guy dipped from a sitcom like it was nothing I think shows die slow without the right cast | Truly, I would've watched Mulder and Scully do the dishes in silence for 40 minutes.  

The ""main plot"" did nothing for me and seemed disjointed at best.  The casting director absolutely knocked it out of the park on day 1 and the show was built on that foundation of chemistry. | There's a few good episodes with the new pair. | Agent Doggit actually grew on me a little bit! He‚Äôs not Mulder but I can watch those episodes and enjoy them. | In fairness, I do think Doggett and Reyes were good additions to the show and even helped push things forward some by forcing Scully to no longer act as the skeptic.

However, it was just Scully and Mulder had such fantastic chemistry that they were always going to be at a disadvantage losing that no matter who they added to the show. More than anything, that *was* the show. It's why I doubt any attempt to revive *The X-Files* would succeed. Scully and Mulder **are** *The X-Files*. | I am such a huge X-Files fan, first show I absolutely adored and remember my step-father's boss would give me seasons to borrow that were on VHS, absolutely massive things to work through and I was only about 10, arguably too young to be watching it but god I loved sitting on the floor engrossed. Watched it several times through over the years, collected the comics, books (which were basically just word for word adaptations of episodes), was a member of the fan club which being from England was long to apply for (my poor mother) via post and now at 37 I have 3 tattoos related to the show and yet...I've still never watched an episode of the Robert Patrick/Reyes eras. Feel partially like a fraud but even at a young age my interest dipped when Mulder left and that chemistry that I'd followed for years wasn't there. | I actually really like Doggit and wish the fans would have given the character a chance to grow. He suffered from Not Mulder big time but I really liked how the tables turned and it was Scully who was the believer. It could have developed into something interesting had the fans given it a chance. And the writing didn‚Äôt suck | yep. the show needed the duo | I did like the new dynamic of Scully being the crazy one because she had seen so much that defied scientific explanation, but there‚Äôs a reason we still talk about her chemistry with Mulder all these years later. | But why male models? | Wait, Mulder, one of only two lead characters on the show, left the show and the producers still tried to keep the show alive? Yep, totally sounds like it should have worked, I don't see what the issue was | The alien story line is üëå

Many (not all) of the monster of the week filler episodes tho, were ü´† | amen, i just reached this point in my watch through of the series for the first time and it's making it way harder to continue. and >!I just got the the part where they find his corpse!< | I loved Dogget. I only watched the show because my wife liked it. I always thought Mulder and Scully were a little too afraid of the big government conspiracy stuff. Dogget didn‚Äôt care. The boogeymen might get him but he‚Äôll shoot a few of them along the way. The show needed more of that and I‚Äôm glad it got it. | It wasn't as good, almost a different show, but Robert Patrick as Doggett was pretty good. It was a good show, but the Mulder/Scully dynamic made it special. | How the fuck did I not know Mulder left X-Files?! | At the time yes (but I was a child). But recently did a rewatch and realised how dirty I'd done Doggett. He became one of my favourite characters. | Idk, for me the show died off when it became a sci fi comedy series instead of a sci fi thriller | I thought Robert Patrick would be a great add to the show, but nope. Between his one-dimensional character and the abrupt change of Scully to the ""believer"" against a newly-induced skeptic, the show was painful to watch. | I kinda liked Agent Doggett.  It wasn't the same, but I still found it entertaining how this old-school cop who doesn't believe in all this weird stuff gets thrust into Mulder's position.  It worked better than trying to have a new Mulder who was like the old one.  They handled it much better than That 70s show. | I didn't think anyone else remembered that show. | Great show but sad cause you can see flickers of MJF dealing with parkinsons | Part of the reason was that production moved from New York to LA after Fox left. I don‚Äôt think it was ever explicitly said why Janelle, James, and Nikki also left the show at the same time MJF left, but it was because at least two of the two actors were New York based. | This answered triggered my memory of NewsRadio. I always remembered it getting canceled because of Phil Hartman‚Äôs death rip | No but I think it was still good. I started watching during the Charlie Sheen season and never thought it was bad. | I still enjoyed watching it after charlie sheen replaced Michael j fox, then again, i actually found it refreshing when charlie was replaced in two and a half men.

There was only one show i stopped watching after someone left the show, well not exactly left but become less prominent, was when zoey left for college in blackish | Yes and no. I missed MJF but Charlie did a good job. | Best with MJF but I think that it worked well with Charlie sheen. That show was great. | Agreed....but; I didn't mind Charlie Sheen.



Having Mayor Winston call Charlie ""Mike"" until Charlie proves himself was a hilarious transition. | Oh man I love that show, it's been so long since I had seen an episode. I never watched it fully. | Props to them for actually going with the death plotline instead of sending the character to a farm upstate | To be fair though, the show had more episodes without him than it did with him. He hadn't had a long running show in awhile, so I don't know if it would have lasted even with him. | And years ago he was on  Three‚Äôs Company and the show was never the same after Suzanne Sommers left the show. | D: i miss this show | That was so sad

I was so confused by what happened because they wrote his death into the show | I actually enjoyed both pre- and post-Ritter. It was a great show with him on it, but I hesitate to say flat out superior; they handled his death in a dignified manner and the show had heart and different kind of a charm afterwards. It is easier to love a show with Ritter, no doubt, but it wasn‚Äôt awful by any means (in my mind) after. | That show has some of the best dialogue and character arcs surrounding grief and death that I have ever witnessed. They really allowed the show to sit in a dark place for a period of time and they didn‚Äôt just ‚Äòsnap out of it‚Äô after a few episodes. The issue of loss was revisited in very real and beautiful ways as the show moved forward. | You're gonna make me start crying on a Tuesday morning? Really? Rude. | Guess he couldn't stick to the rules ü§∑ | I honestly don't understand how they thought they could continue it without him | I dont know if they could keep if up anyway, they put him in the White house way too fast.¬† It's like if Tom caught Jerry at the end of season 2.


But it still would have been good, maybe not great.¬† I couldn't watch past like first 3 or 4 episodes after they got rid of him. | To this day I don't know why they even bothered trying.¬† | No reason to hate saying it. The accusations against Kevin Spacey were so weak that they totally failed not only on criminal grounds but also even to establish civil liability in multiple countries. [From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey):

> In 2017, Spacey faced several allegations of sexual misconduct. In 2018 and 2019, Spacey faced multiple criminal investigations; however, in each case Spacey was either not charged or the charges against him were dropped. He has denied the accusations and was found not liable in a 2022 lawsuit in New York. In a separate case in London, he was acquitted by a jury of sexual assault charges in 2023. | Was about to say that. | They should have just continued the character with added sexual misconduct scandals. Frank Underwood was a complete asshole anyway.¬† | To be fair, that show was spinning the drain even with Spacey towards the end. | I watched the first post-Spacey episode, interesting plot how they reacted to replacing him, then I watched like half of the next, and I supposed there‚Äôs another whole season left? | The show should have ended with the famous ring tap on the desk. It would have become a classic. | The seasoning following his departure was nonsensical. Like they just pasted random footage together and hoped it worked out as a story. Too bad, the early seasons were so good. | Yep, but the worst part of it was removing Spacey purely over allegations, he was never convicted in a trial. | He is a terrible person, but he is a great actor. | He was too good as ... himself, as it turned out. House of Cards was so excellent. Damn it. | The show was going down hill regardless but it completely jumped off a cliff post Spacey | I usually have a soft spot for ""bad seasons"" or ""bad movies"", always finding something good, or the reason as to why it's bad.


But not that last season of House of Cards.

It was trash, and they could have done just about anything to make it better than the route they went. | TBF, it was getting bad WITH him as well. If you remove the main character then there is no more point the the story. | it shoud have ended the moment he becomes president, that was the point, he got the power, the journey is much more interesting than the destination. | Holy shit, I just commented on this not seeing your post and said the exact same thing. | I think it‚Äôs because they couldn‚Äôt outcrazy Trump. Couldn‚Äôt keep it interesting anymore. | Yeah this has to be the most prominent answer. Wow that thing did a nosedive. | It was shit post Ian Richardson¬† | I womder if they could've gotten away with just recasting it and bringing in someone like Geoffrey Rush or Jeff Bridges to play Frank for a couple more seasons. | I‚Äôm happy to no longer have to endure hearing about that particular creepy old man. | He has huge acting talent, despite all the other stuff that got him replaced. 

There's not _many_ people who could carry off a 'lead role' in House of Cards, ever. It requires just the right mix of charismatic deviousness and ... well, evil I guess. | The last season was so clearly strained, at no fault of the writers. Eric was just too big a part to write around | To be fair it started sucking before Eric left. Eric was just the final nail. | God, the only ""good"" episodes in Season 8 are the first two and the last one. All the others are just... confusing. | That was one of those things though where they tacked on an 8th season. I distinctly remember the end of the seventh season being advertised as ""the series finale!"", then they added another season. | I feel it was less about who left and more about who came in. Randy was so awful | Which one? | When the sister left.. it was just off! | I was looking for this | came to say this Lol | I listen to Family Trips with the Meyers Brothers. Seth Meyers brother Josh played Randy. I feel so bad for him. He's really funny and a great writer but he got a raw deal trying to come in as a replacement character. | They've ready stated that they're only doing two more seasons, and I think much of the filming is back-to-back. | To me it's already dead. The writing was already getting tenuous, without Cavill I'm not going to bother. | I didn't even finish season 2 cause I heard he was leaving. Dude made the show with the shits he gave | Lauren Schmidt Hissrich and her team of writers should be entirely blamed for this. Why do Netflix keep fucking up so bad with their series. | I think it failed before he left. | I mean the show already failed with him (inspite of him, that is). | Could only get through season 1 because of him. 

So annoyed that they messed it up so badly. | This actually worked out for me because now we get war hammer | They already cancelled the 7 seasons project and end it with season 5.

The witcher is already dead.

Cavill couldn't save that anyways. That's why he left. | Well he wasn't really in the last season anyway. | IMO the books started to go downhill in #4, and I couldn't even read #5 They are working with lame source material from this point anyway, in addition the actor change. | henry cavill was the only good thing the show had, and even that couldn‚Äôt get me to watch season 3. i agree that some changes needed to be made from the novels, but the way they absolutely butchered yennefer‚Äôs story and character really upset me. not to mention the whole dandelion and radovid love story which is downright disgusting. (in the books radovid is a child and dandelion 30+. and radovid is a genocidal maniac. dandelion would NEVER).

i hope that show dies quickly and is forgotten. season one was good, but the rest fell apart. | I still haven't finished season two, so... | I tried watching the first episode 4 times IDK what's wrong with me or this Witcher | As soon as I heard that I was done with the show. | I mean the way it was going it wasn't gonna last long even with Henry, now it's as good as dead | Wait, they're still cranking out episodes after Henry left? Who's playing Geralt now? | I found that show to be unwatchable around episode 2. I powered through six or seven before I completely bailed on it. | Seee I agree but I also think his acting was awful on the show so it‚Äôs a weird situation. lol | I already stopped once the adopted daughter got older after covid and it turned creepy. .. | This | George, yang, karev‚Ä¶. The way they just made him disappear and write notes to everyone. So dumb | I‚Äôm still in it. But mainly because it‚Äôs this Shawshank redemption ‚Äúmaybe if you‚Äôve come this far, you‚Äôre willing to come a little further‚Äù motivation. Been watching from the start, gotta ride the wave until it‚Äôs done. 

I will say, this past season they introduced a whole brand new group of interns and it‚Äôs mainly focusing on them and it‚Äôs been a bit of a refresh compared to some of the last few seasons. | This is EXACTLY what came to my mind. Once Cristina and Derek were gone, it was over. I think I watched 1-2 more seasons but have completely stopped watching. | I agree completely! I was done after Derek, too & I loved that show so much! üò≠ | Especially because Cristina didn't come back even briefly to be there for Meredith | When the killed off George I was shook. When Lexy and then Mac Steamy were killed I had to stop watching. | Let‚Äôs be real‚Ä¶. It all started to go downhill when George died. | Didn't care about Derek dying as his character was just annoying to me.

But yeah the show was already on the decline but once Sandra left it got really bad. Especially some of the actors they were hiring on the show were just..not good at acting. Sandra is extremely talented and deserved better than Grey's so I respect her for leaving but was sad as a grey's fan lol | It didn't fail though, they are still making it. | The show was Network garbage, but my wife went through a watch of it. 

They killed my favorite character and chopped my other favorite character's legs off in the same episode. Talk about a bummer | I couldn't make it past Izzy/Danny's ghost. | Exactly the same for me. | I started watching that for the first time this year (I mean I've seen episodes here and there but never followed it).¬† I saw some article about it and had had no idea it was still running, which got me curious and I started from the beginning.


Yang was my fave and I didn't think I'd enjoy it after she left, but I kept watching.¬† Then they killed off Derek, who I didn't even really care for, and I completely lost interest.¬† I got 2 or 3 episodes into that following season and then moved on. | How did they kill him off? | That whole show was - let's kill a major and liked/loved character each season.  I got bored with that model after 4 seasons | Bro I was done when McSteamy died | I made it up to the inclusion of Covid. It was too real for me at that point and it‚Äôs not why I watched. | I stopped watching I think season 19? The season Alex left and I refuse to watch it knowing how he left Meredith. Alex would never have left a damn note. That‚Äôs how Izzy left him and it broke him. | They killed McDreamy!?! Spoilers! | You might have stopped watching. But Grey‚Äôs has hardly failed. Cannot believe it‚Äôs still on! | Sloan was my favourite. Why do him dirty like that | Tbh I think this but then randomly catch an episode cuz it happens to be the right timeslot and the show gets me every time and idk most of the characters and it doesn't even matter and I still cry. | I agree with this oneüò≠ | Downhill after they killed george | THEY DID WHAT TO DEREK? | Honestly even George was a hit, but Cristina was fatal. | Way ahead of you. When Izzy died of cancer, I was done. | I am rewatching Greys while on maternity leave, and I am
At the end of season 10, I know it all goes downhill after this‚Ä¶. I never watched after Derek died so perhaps I'll give it a chance? | For me, the show died when Cristina left. That would've been a perfect stopping point for the show, with the core group going their separate ways outside of Grey-Sloan. | I'm still watching but I mock it a LOT. | Came here to say this.¬† | Teachers also went downhill when he left. If Andrew Lincoln is in your cast, keep him happy | Had I not been such a huge Jeffery Dean Morgan fan I would have stopped watching it after Glenn died. | He came back, there was a spin off show with him and Michonne.

https://m.imdb.com/title/tt9859436/ | The show was already on the decline but Andrew Lincoln was always so fantastic in that role | No idea why i kept watching, just wanted to follow it through. Cba with the new spinoffs though | Only kept watching for Jesus and then they *-* him too. Everyone went. | Me currently watching the walking dead üòµ ü§£ü§£I probably won‚Äôt remember this but idk if I should continue watching if it gets boring | Have to admit, I was pulled back in for those 6 episodes of The Ones Who Live. Episode 4 (which Dana wrote) was so good. Never needed to go back and fill myself in on what happened when I checked out after season 8. | For me it was Steven Yuen (Glen) | I read this as Abraham Lincoln and was like, oh the zombie of Lincoln must have shown up at some point. That's neat. | On a helicopter no less. | Isn't it still going on?  I dipped during the absolute character assassination of Andrea | Incidentally, I ‚Äúmet‚Äù him around the height of the show‚Äôs success (I believe it was 2016) and he was incredibly gracious.  It was at a golf course in Georgia.  He was a couple of stations down from me at the driving range, and the poor guy probably didn‚Äôt get to hit more than 5 balls because everyone kept coming over to him wanting to talk. | Isn‚Äôt he back in the show in The Ones Who Live? | Honestly the cast was probably the main reason why most kept watching. | Yeah I just hit this point and I gave up 3 episodes after the timeskip. | The show was done before but I see | I don't mind Andrew Lincoln leaving as long as he served his purpose on the show and his character dying. But this on terms that Carl has survived S8. | Yeah after rick it was a downward spiral | Agreed. I started Walking dead from the beginning as it played live. I said if Andrew Lincoln ever goes I‚Äôm done with this series. I watched until he left and never looked back. He made that show as far as I‚Äôm concerned. | I had to stop watching because of Carl. That kid was the most annoying character ever. The stupid hat... You wanna be all hating on your dad but still wearing the hat from like 4 years ago. | The ending of the show disappointed me, the way they handled his legacy, his sons all just kinda eh in the end. Bjorns death was okay but Ivar? Don‚Äôt get me started on how he was not only walking but fighting in full fledged battle thanks to some iron age prosthetics and then he just‚Ä¶what gives up? After the english king is skewered into a kebab and then just keeps on going like it was a flesh wound. And then that flip flopping little turd Hvitjerk becomes a Christian even though he‚Äôs shown no inclination for committing to anything throughout the whole show. 
And floki? Dudes miles deep in a mountain that falls on his head and next minute he was in america?

Thank you but that‚Äôs a no from me. | That was a bummer , but then again it was ‚Äúloosely‚Äù based on history, so they were just following the timeline of history. What a great show, though! | Vikings was an amazing show that turned into complete garbage without Ragnar. I forgot about that show | I agree.  The series invested a lot of time/effort into humanizing Ragnar, so after he was killed and the great horde exacted their revenge, I sort of lost interest.  The series had always revolved around Ragnar, so when he died it ran out of steam. | I tried finishing the show, once he was gone it just became a chore to watch. I never did end up finishing the show. | I totally agree with this. Loved Vikings, and I agree that Ragnar's sons definitely had more historical records than Ragnar did (he was more of a legend than a person) and they tried to run with that. Unfortunately, Alex Hogh Anderson didn't have the leading man charisma that Travis Fimmel did and he couldn't carry the show, even though Ivar was a great character. | I thought it¬†kind of sucked a lot earlier than that, but that might just be because I'm actually into that stuff and studied it back at university. | His burial was the end of the show in my eyes.

In history it's actually Rollo who is the complete badass. The whole stay in France and gain tons of land but is historical if my memory is correct
As well as his son | Facts. | I barely even tried finishing it. There's more of the show after Ragnar died than before he died. | Oh man sadly how true this was ü•∫ | Yeah I still need to finish the last season or 2. It‚Äôs been months and I just stopped watching basically when he died. I think I watched a handful of episodes after that. | I stopped watching the show for about a year or so after he died. I only went back because I was curious wtf happened. Boy was I disappointed further. Especially the ending. | Bjorn and Lagertha just barely kept it together, but the other Sons of Ragnar were boring. | but we would have missed Bj√∂rn's death, that was badass, | Look what they did to my beautiful boy! | But how fucking good was Vikings until they killed him off tho? Those scenes between Ragnar and the King were insane. 

Those two, plus Eliza Butterworth as Aelswith in The Last Kingdom were some of my favourite TV performances ever. Absolutely magnificent. | I just tried to watch this show and turned it off 20 minutes in because his fake accent was so bad | I wouldn't say it failed, at all. | Nooooooo. I didn't think this show was that popular. On season 3 rip. | Hard disagree, though I get how it could turn a lot of people off. The final season certainly wasn‚Äôt as strong as the others, but I truly loved Ivar‚Äôs story. It was interesting to see how his father‚Äôs failings played out in his own choices. | Cool I guess I don‚Äôt need to watch that now it‚Äôs spoiled üò≠üôà | It didn't fail because The Professor left. The Professor left because the show started taking a turn for the worse.

You also forgot Wade. | I wish they would do a reboot I think it would do good as with some series being short. | Loved the show as well. I don't think I'd ever seen it mentioned on reddit though.¬† | Yeah I was gonna say Sliders because basically everyone left. That first season was so awesome (I was like 11 at the time so mileage may vary). I have to say though, the introduction of Kari Wuhrer was an early teenage awakening for me though. | It was such an interesting premise with great cast chemistry. Eventually main characters started dropping like flies, it went off the rails with the plot. I don't even remember how it finished or if there was ever any resolution to getting wade back or dealing with the kromags. | I loved it as a kid but became less interested after the show shifted to CroMags and when the brothers randomly merged or something at the beginning of the season I was completely done. | I remember the first episode came on really strong with the science and I was excited about a sciency show and then after that they never brought up the science again | God I hate Jerry O'Connell so fucking much | It took me many years to watch the later seasons as I couldn't bring myself to do it. Losing Nathan was horrible, but then Alisha,Kelly, and Simon was too much for me. | I watched everything because I still loved the other characters but goddamnit they basically killed off Simon and Alisha with an unending time loop?! And the switching powers plot just felt lazy. So disappointing for such a great start | Yeah for me Nathan carried the show so I tapped out as soon as he was gone. 

‚ÄúCan we *please stop* killing our probation workers?!‚Äù |  Misfits definitely fits the bill. Losing Nathan was a rough one for the fans, and it felt like the whole vibe changed after that. The early seasons had such a unique energy, but once they started swapping out key characters, it just didn‚Äôt hit the same way. It's wild how a single actor can shape a show so much. | I couldn‚Äôt finish after Robert Sheehan (Nathan) left. I don‚Äôt know what went into that decision. | Rudy was great. But once the whole of the first crew had gone, it was not the same show at all. The final season was a struggle. | I bet you f*** your sister for a piece of cheese. | I was done when Iwan's story line finished. They had the audacity to make me obsessed with him and then were like ""K. That's enough of him.""

It was also pretty shit when they all switched powers. It just got weird then and felt like it lost all the point. | It was Simon leaving that did it for me. He was my favourite character | Rudi was a great character addition but the main cast kept leaving after he arrived which I think was the problem, eventually it just became boring. | I loved that show and was gutted when they fucked it up. Being Human was another one. They changed the entire cast except for that one bit part and rehashed the whole thing. It never recovered. | I've never seen past Nathan leaving.

Oh that's sort of a lie. I've seen a few of the new episodes and I'm not interested lol | Tbf Joe Gilgun as Rudy was superb. Carried the show emotionally and comedically after Nathan left.

Currently watching Brassic with Gilgun in it and he is once again the star of the show. Big recommend. 

I'm surprised he's not been picked up to be in bigger shows. I think the closest he got over in America was Preacher? | Yeah after Danzig left I didn‚Äôt care for any of the later episodes | I honestly ended up liking the end team more than the beginning team, so I‚Äôm always surprised to see people say this

Rudy was the funniest character in the entire show. | It's funny that this also applies to the band. | Each OG castmate leaving was awful - but Curtis turning himself into a zombie and then having to shoot himself was literally the worst death on the show üò≠ I still complete the series, but it is nothing without the OGs. Rudy and his dad both having their bipolar characteristics personified was pretty interesting, and Abby being imaginary. The rest of the noobs were boring. | I agree. Losing Nathan was already a big blow. But I couldn't continue after Simon left too. | It's a shame, some of the later characters were great but that loss of the core group and relationships just left a weird feeling after | That‚Äôs actually one of the first shows I really liked where the main characters just left. It‚Äôs just not the same.. | I agree with this one. I stopped watching when most of the characters left | totally different show at the end. I still enjoyed it but definitely didn‚Äôt compare to the og‚Äôs. | Such a good show! | 100% agree! I remember watching the first season of two and loving it. After the main characters started to leave I stopped watching it as much and finally all together. | I only watched a few episodes of season three, but I don‚Äôt think that I can get past that. | I'm actually rewatching this right now. It survives after Nathan leaves though it never feels quite right but then it absolutely collapses once the rest of the original cast leaves. Rudy was not a bad character but I think they actually did him dirty by making him so similar to Nathan. It just reminds you of the shoes he's trying to fill. Though I think there was also a problem with the power of the week stuff starting to feel way too formulaic even by the second season. First season felt organic but after that it was very 'okay, what stranger that they meet has the power this time?' | I‚Äôm actually surprised to see this without scrolling that far! I really liked the series, not a masterpiece but it was good.. until they switched out the main cast.. | Tbh I think they kinda fucked the ""ending"" with the original characters anyway. | I might get hated for saying this, but the second gang (Rudy, Jess, Abbey, Finn and Alex) were much better imo.¬† | Can you supply more information? I‚Äôve never heard of this show. Thanks. | Misfits was amazing till Nathan left, Rudy was ok but still couldn't ""replace"" Nathan's vibe.¬† | Because I came to it late, and was able to binge it, I just took it as anthology-type deal and just expected the cast to change. There wasn't much continuity other than the community building, so I didn't mind. I'm just sad there hasn't been any more seasons. First season was the best, but I enjoyed them all. My single favorite episode didn't even happen until S3.  The time travel hitler one! ""Fookin nawtzees"" | Season 4 was an absolute wreck, true, but season 5 brought it all back together. Also, though Nathan was funnier, I thought that Rudy was much more compelling as a lead. | I just started a rewatch of this show. I originally finished it completely. On this rewatched I stopped when the new cast was brought in. Without Nathan there. Man, that show just isn‚Äôt the same. | Was looking for this comment lmao | I still don't understand what the hell they were thinking when they tried to keep it going after the entire cast had left | Are you saying they jumped the shark before they jumped the shark? | ""Hold on a minute...where's Chuck?"" | There was an episode of that show where a guy literally jumped over a shark. And it was the *best* one. | Narrator: It did | Oddly, Ted McGinley is also a sign of the shark in a series.

Man only shows up after a major change in a sitcom, and then buys the show a few more years of life.

Dude is awesome. | Didn't know of Golden Palace but I can't imagine Golden Girls without the trio. Chemestry is just amazing between them, particular when Bea has to bite her hand to stay in character when Betty's telling another story from ""back in St. Olaf"". | Estelle Getty‚Äôs Lewy body dementia also clearly had advanced a lot by the time Golden Palace was filmed. It‚Äôs noticeable in Golden Girls but inescapable in Golden Palace. Made me sad to watch. | That plus the whole thing with them buying a hotel was just bizarre. It didn‚Äôt help when they added a kid. It was like they were trying every desperate sitcom trick to make it work. | Golden Palace began to come together as the season progressed I felt. To be honest the only weak spot was Rose because she really had nobody to play off of. Rose would just wander in and make some goofy comments and wander off. | Golden Palace had more issues than just Bea Arthur leaving. They also removed them from the house, put them in a hotel, and threw in a spunky kid. Just completely got rid of everything that felt like the Golden Girls. | Weird, never even heard of Golden Palace! | Golden Palace gave us Don Cheadle at least | >Hotch was just the last straw for me personally

For me, it was when Morgan left. Hotch not being in the series was bad too, but Morgan's departure just left me feeling empty. I missed his wholesome relationship with Garcia. | Same honestly. Always felt torn on feeling such a way since everywhere you read, Gibson was an absolute piece of shit to work with. | Okay I'm clueless why'd they kick him off?? | This is the first show that came to mind for me because the entire series was a clusterfuck of writing people off then bringing them back and constantly bringing in new people every season.  I had a hard time getting into it when Gideon was written off early on then I finally do just for Prentiss, AJ and Hotch to all get written off at one point then toward the later seasons Morgan getting written off. All of them felt like a true loss. I also found the new characters they brought on to be dull and it was just hard to get into it with most of the original cast members missing in seasons at one point or another | Have you watched the latest ? Prentice carries the role like a boss , unhinged rossi is the most likeable his character ever was | I feel the same way. The show really jumped the shark after Hotch left. He really was the one holding the team together. I loved Prentice as an agent, but she just didn‚Äôt have the same impact as the unit chief. | It's remarkable how divided the Criminal Minds fandom is on these issues! I'm on the camp that not only feels things got more interesting after Hotch - because we were finally done with Foyet, ffs - but also believes Evolution has all the greatness the OG show could've had, had they been given an R rating from the start. | See Prentiss is my fav! I don‚Äôt even like Hotch until Prentiss  shows up. Rossi bugs me until the later seasons, I enjoyed Gideon more in the beginning. 

That being said, check out Criminal Minds Evolution. They can swear and it‚Äôs amazing. Nothing like Prentiss dropping a real appropriate f bomb | Yeah me too.

I think maybe it was jarring for the writers (understandably) because right after he left it was like they & the show runners etc had no idea what to do. 

The vibe changed & the storylines went downhill. Even with other likeable characters struggled to keep watching & gave up when they had Reid go to prison. It felt so gimmicky & became boring. 

I do understand why they needed to let Gibson go but I feel like they were scrambling to do various things for viewership & it backfired. | I did not realize that they let Thomas Gibson go. I had to stop watching the show before the series ended. Why did they fire him? | > Thomas Gibson

I feel it went downhill after Mandy left anyway. At least Thomas was able to keep the show from collapsing in on itself after that but I had already lost interest and would only catch an episode here and there. | I don‚Äôt know or remember why they kicked Thomas Gibson off the show ? | It was ridiculous how they treated Gibson.  I could never stand Prentice. | I remember just how big The Walking Dead was in my country, everyone was talking about it, the impact was similar to what Game Of Thrones has during it‚Äôs peak. But then TWD just keep dragging on and on, and now nobody care about it anymore | Everyone always mentions Glenn's death but the fans knew it was coming from the comics.

What really killed the show off was Carl's death in my opinion. Carl is **utterly instrumental** to the ending of the comic book that without him you can't do it properly.

The moment he died, the comic fans knew there was no structure anymore and the writers were just swinging wildly and seeing what sticks. Kind of like Game of Thrones once they surpassed the books, except this was on purposefully self-inflicted, which is even worse! | I stopped after Carl, which was shocking to me. | I couldn't get past it after Hershel died. Is it actually worth pushing through? | Glenn was the only character whose life was made better by the apocalypse. I didn‚Äôt have any motivation to even finish that season after they killed him off. | Same. I feel like that‚Äôs a drop of point for a lot of people. | Yep same, didn't watch an episode after that. Just had enough | That whole season was the reason I quit watching | It was that season that I realized I'm just watching a rinse and repeat cycle of a show | I really feel like that scene transformed the show from fun, melodramatic zombie indulgence to basically just torture porn. 


The tone changed, viewers felt betrayed, and even the dreadlocked Shakespearean king guy with the tiger couldn't entice them back. | I stopped watching when they pretended to kill off Glen. | TWD lost 25% of its viewers when Glenn died.

Historically the worst decision by the writers in the history of TV as far as character deaths go. He was the heart and soul of the broken people left there. I no longer cared about that world after Glenn died. | I stopped watching after Carl. Knowing the behind the scenes stuff with the actor too made it extra difficult to come back | I stopped watching it then, but honestly I had been hate- watching that shit since T-Dog died. | I was a faithful watcher but I never watched another episode after that horror. | I didn't even finish that episode! | I might be remembering with rose tinted glasses, but I thought the Negan stuff was good. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a fantastic and charismatic actor | I binge watched The Walking Dead last year, the whole first to last episode for the first (and probably last) time, after several unsuccessful attempts at getting past the first episode. I fully expected to lose interest after that ""Glenn dies"" episode, being aware of fan outrage all over social media back then, but surprisingly, I was still motivated and interested enough to see it through. | Yeah. It was like watching stock that you‚Äôd held for a long time just go to zero, with no chance of recovery. ¬†Why trust it again. | I think almost everyone stopped watching after this episode. I have seen this being mentioned so many times! | He‚Äôs still trapped under a dumpster for me. That‚Äôs the last episode I watched. | Dale's death really soured the show for me. | Same | I stopped at the end of Season 8. There was no need to continue after then, they ended that season in a perfectly fine note that could have worked as a series finale. | I stopped after Carl. Absolutely ruined it. | That was probably the end of the show being good. Once zombies stopped being a real threat, it just started repeating the same mini saga over and over. Meet new people, we dont get along, overcome. I probably watched the last 5 seasons just because I had invested so much time in the show, I wanted to see it end. And it didn't, they just stopped repeating themselves.

And if you want people to continue to give a shit about your bad writing, don't even consider using this ""half-season"" bullshit. That was the worst television invention since commercial breaks. | Exactly. It just spiralled after that. | The walking dead was every season just running into a worse and worse group and a different location. | I stopped watching once I realized it was transitioning from a show about zombies to a show with zombies. So... season 2 or 3? | Same | It's really amazing how the writers basically killed the show with that. Like who the fuck were they trying to impress? The we're trying to be game of thrones edgy but didn't realize they didn't have the staying power | It's funny how everybody was so busted up about Glenn, and I was always far more upset about Abraham. He was one of my absolute favorite characters. | They did their best to follow the comic series. BUT out of the things they did change up, Glenn‚Äôs death could‚Äôve been one of those in my opinion. | Never watched another episode after that, stopped cold turkey | If its any consolation, his death is a constant reminder and direct cause for other events throughout the entire rest of the show and into the spinoffs. | Me too.

But my wife kept watching.  I don't know how many seasons that Neagan shit dragged on for, but he was on the television like every other day for a year in my home =/ | I tried really hard but it felt like every episode after that was dedicated to Negan. I'm not a Negan fan and don't get the Negan worship from the fanbase so I just stopped. | Same. I haven‚Äôt watched a single episode after that happened | For me, it wasn't so much about killing the character but how they did it.

They basically aired the second-to-last episode as the season finale and on top of that he  POV switch for cheap drama just booted you out of the show.  

If they were relying on stunts like that for drama, I knew that whenever they were going to show the actual end of the season, it wasn't gonna be worth it. | Negan killed off the show anyways

Hearing 1,000 smug Jefferey Dean Morgan monologues got old real fast | I watched it all and am the walking dead | That was the best stopping point. After that the show took a huge nosedive. | Same. According to my wife, who kept watching, I didn't miss much. | His death was a real frickin gut punch. I didn‚Äôt feel like I could emotionally invest in anymore characters specifically after that. | TWD was killing off all of my favorite characters. I missed Glenn death episode but it was spoiled for me that he had died and I decided not to pick it back up. | I stopped a little after the time they killed off Jon Bernthal, him there really gave it family drama. He claimed he died on the spot but he didn't have the medical equipment that actually says if he was alive or not. Took the man's family as his own. I think when they got to the prison, and then his wife died. | Do yourself a favour and don't bother watching the mini series either. They're dull and nonsensical.

Daryl Dixon spends 8 hours to tell you nothing has happened. Bad guy, wait there's a bigger bad guy, no wait there's a bigger bad organisation, super zombies. Bigger bad guy inexplicably goes through a 180 degree character flip. Big bad Organisation doesn't even get stopped.

Rick and Michonne show is just boring which is a shame as it was the one i was most looking forward to. | I stopped after Shane. #rip | Was he ever convicted? | Yeah, but also fuck that guy. | Jeremy Clarkson is the only reason any car show was this successful.  There is no reason a British Show about cars would be an international success but his brand of humour and the format they turned the show into just connected. | Apparently The Grand Tour is going to continue with new presenters too, hasn't Amazon seen how shit TG became? | +Grand tour when they retire and the show is planned to continue | 100% - the Clarkson, Mr Slow and Hammond were the most popular, fun, and entertaining shows I‚Äôve ever watched.  I loved them. 

TG was an okay car show before, I liked it as a kid. But then with those three it elevated beyond a car show and became a show that was for car lovers to enjoy the escapades of three different people that were together greater than the sum of their parts. 

I loved it. 

I do rewatch as often as I can, especially some of the specials, or the ones with epic challenges (usually with cool af shitboxes that I wanted when I was a kid, or were just always shit). 

So many classic moments in the series. Hilarious and connected with the audience so well. | Top Gear kept going after they left lol? | Yeah, it was never the same once the original host - Angela Rippon - left.

William Woollard just couldn't compare. | We all agree with you! | This is like a case study of unique, once-in-a-lifetime talent. Jeremy, Richard and James had a chemistry that you cannot manufacture, let alone find naturally often. Their knowledge of cars, their history as journalists, presenters and friends presented the right stuff for the show to flourish. Andy Wilman knew how to produce them, their adventures were always chock full of laughs, bits of informative (albeit useless) car details, and wonderful cinematography for a show of that kind.

If you strike gold with talent like that, consider yourself lucky‚Ä¶.. the BBC producer who got butthurt over Jeremy‚Äôs reaction (while absolutely uncalled for and unprofessional) should‚Äôve sought arbitration instead of going full nepobaby getting Jeremy fired. Because of the loss of the trio, it doomed the show and Top Gear brand, so much so BbC has announced it won‚Äôt return for ‚Äúthe foreseeable future‚Äù | I think it jumped the shark long before that. It became too contrived and formulaic. Fake jeopardy and tiresome ""spontaneous"" events. | I think it was the three of them that worked. If Clarkson stayed and Hammond and May were gone, or any combination there of, it wouldn't have worked, it was the team. | Those three gave us some of the funniest tv ever in the history of tv. | The 2nd set of replacement cast members after the original trio left did a decent job. | Absolutely! | I know right!




At least Tiff and Quentin went on to make 5th Gear though | The new presenters sound and act like characters in Forza Horizon which is the cringiest and most unwatchable the twisted blabber called british accent can get. Absolutely unwatchable, no humor, no chemistry,  new top gear has bothing on the original trio. | Once that trio left it was never the same. | Chris Harris is excellent. The only other person who could come close to matching the original three. | It just wasn‚Äôt the same after Angela Rippon left | It was never the same without Chris Goffey | That trio of Clarkson, Hammond, and May absolutely can‚Äôt be beat. But Clarkson is a giant knob and I now find it difficult to care about watching him in anything. | I'd lost interest in Top Gear a few seasons before Clarkson got handy with his fists because dinner wasn't ready. It was the ramping of the bigotry that did it for me - like they had decided they were going to appeal to the Nigel Farage fans for some reason.¬† | Came here to say this. It started failing when Ziva left. Dinozzo sealed its death. | I was going to say Abby. When the relationship between Abby and Gibbs disappears because of the problems on set, it just loses something special. | crazy how the show is still going | Isn't that show still running? Is Harmon chasing criminals from a walker? | And now they‚Äôre bringing him and Ziva back after Bull ended | It's because it didn't drag too long after Ragnar death, season after death which was solid and last one which was only bad season. | Yeah. Sheen made that show because it was basically Sheen playing himself. Kutcher came on board playing Kutcher‚Ä¶and it turns out he‚Äôs boring AF. That‚Äôs when they had to turn Alan into a cartoon character to compensate. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that crazy antics will that Alan get into this week to get money?‚Äù | The best answer. It lasted four more years but it was basically a hollowed out corpse after Charlie left. | The joke is Charlie Sheen did enough coke to kill two and a half men. | I clicked ""Comments"" and before I could press ""T"" on my keyboard ... there's your comment, right in my face. | The final episode was an abomination. | IMO the show was always trash. Chuck Lorre‚Äôs a fuckin hack | This is what first came to my mind as well | there it is ....was scrolling for a bit and amazed nobody said it for a while...this is the most obvious case i have ever seen of this | Still lasted 4 more seasons. | Charlie Sheen is a cracked out freak and deserves no praise | That show was trash from day one | The actor was in a position to direct a movie and asked for the time off to do so. They wouldn't give it to him so he asked to be killed off. He wanted to leave because he wanted to direct.

[The directing job was not something that I could walk away from. It was such a huge opportunity. It feels like a good next step in my career and my life; I always dreamed of being a director. So to be able to do something like this on such a huge scale ‚Äîit‚Äôs a huge studio movie ‚Äî it‚Äôs definitely not something I could turn my back on. It was a sacrifice for sure. But I‚Äôm three weeks into filming and having the time of my life. I couldn‚Äôt imagine it working out any other way.](https://tvline.com/interviews/john-francis-daley-interview-bones-why-did-he-leave-sweets-552367/) | My universe... that still hurts. | I checked out early on that show when the genius Zach Addy teams up with the Gormogon serial killer but after he is caught, his nihilistic murderousness is defeated in 5 minutes by Bones' irrefutable logic and morality.  Like it just suddenly dawns on Addy that, hey...maybe helping out a cannibal *wasn't* such a good idea after all. 

I just thought it was bad writing to have someone so smart be so stupid.  

On the other hand, it was kind of a weird show in that Bones is an extremely successful author, meaning she can relate and convey messages to a wide audience...but she needs Booth's help when talking with people because she has few interpersonal skills, is socially awkward and understands little about contemporary culture.

Whaddayagunnado?  It's a TV show. | My wife was in shambles after this. Honestly a dick move to kill a character off like that, especially with a baby on the way. | Many sad deaths in Bones but god this one hurt | The show went off the rails before that, but killing off one of the best characters was a dumb decision. They could have left room for his return. At least then he could have done a cameo here and there between his directing gigs. | This was the first one that came to mind for me.  I lost all interest in the show after binging however many seasons up to that point and never made it back. | Currrntly watching and didn‚Äôt know he diesüò≠ I adore sweets!! | I'm surprised I had to scroll so far down to see this. When JD left, that should have been the end. It was even a logical ending point. Scrubs was HIS story. It made no sense to continue it without him. | What?  Season 8 ended perfectly.  The perfect show. | But it‚Äôs a different show with the same name. And it somehow started at season 9.  weird. | That last season doesn‚Äôt exist to me. | Honestly I didn‚Äôt even know they had carried on. The last I remember is JD walking out the hospital.

Did the other series make it to to the UK? | It wasn't the same without Jan Itor | Came here to answer with this, too. Too great for that show to replace. | Say *WHAAT* | Please, REAL OG‚Äôs know the show went down hill when Ponce De Leon left the show.¬† | Unpopular opinion but I think it started to pick up around the 3rd season, the show was cancelled before they could properly find their footing. | This is the first I'm hearing that show had more than one season so feels like an inevitability. | Fuck Andy Dick. | Fuck Andy Dick. | Also, The Simpsons after the death of Phil Hartman. Troy McClure made his final appearance in season 10, the last good season for most fans of the show. | Honestly the world was worse without Phil Hartman not just that show.  God I loved that guy. | Some would argue the Simpsons after the death of Phil Hartman. Lionel Hutz and Troy McClure were popular characters. He was an irreplaceable and amazing guy. | That show was Joe Rogan at his best. Down hill from there. | Scrolled way too far to see this.  Phil Hartman was a comic genius and the ensemble cast (minus Andy Dick) was money. | They tried shifting the comedy relief role to Goober, but he just couldn‚Äôt fill Barney‚Äôs shoes. | I watched the Andy Griffith Show because it was one of like, 3 channels I could get before I got internet and roku. It was so wholesome! | I agree! Donald leaving really killed it for me. Chevy chase's departure also put a bummer on it, even though the scene with his ""donations"" after death was pretty funny. I still rewatch the show tho, all seasons. | There was a ‚Äúgas leak‚Äù that season, right? | We don't talk about the gas leak year. | Losing Pierce and Donald Glover also big hits to the show.

They leaned way too much into Chang as a central character in later seasons. | As badly as I miss Troy, Shirley, and Pierce, I loved Frankie & Elroy (Hickey I was neutral on). It‚Äôs a real feat to pull off new characters at the tail end of a solid show, and I think the writers & actors did. | God, that‚Äôs such a good show. | Season 4 of Community did give us Brie Larson in her finest role! | Hard disagree. Seasons 5 and 6 are awesome.  They have a different feel because their budgets were slashed so much that they are just always inside, which sort of gives a weird vibe sometimes, but the jokes and cast are still incredible.  Hickey, Elroy, and Padget were great additions.  Hurts losing so many of the main cast, but they kept the bar high. | Interesting. I bailed in season 4 and never saw 5. | 6 seasons and a movie! | Hot Take: I liked Season 4. What I didn't like was Abed's depiction in Season 3 and 5. It was like ""finally, an Autistic-coded character I can relate to- and he's nuts, great..."" | I was wondering why the later seasons seemed a bit too bonkers and zany for my likes. | I'm gonna say it really only applies to season 4 with Harmon's absence. I thought season 5 was pretty damn good and frankly, season 6 is my second favorite. 

While Troy and Abed are iconic, I do think having them figure out who they are without each other was exactly what their character arcs needed at that time, and was constantly something explored with Troy via football, plumbing, and air conditioner repair. 

But all the Abed/Annie shenanigans, his episodes with Frankie or Elroy -- all great. Plus I LOVE Frankie and Elroy. Really hope they're in the movie. Giant Hand episode is one of the best. Hickey also has some incredible moments, particularly the bulletin board hanging episode with Annie and his goblin interrogation in AD&D

Anyway, TLDR; I do think the show's quality suffered without Harmon in 4, but I genuinely love 5 & 6. | I'd argue Community was always great and never failed. It certainly dipped in quality at times and the first three seasons are best, but even the gas leak year was good. | I think Community could have continued with Jeff as a teacher and focusing on him, Dean, and a new cast with originals dropping in occasionally. When season 4 opens with almost immediately walking back all of the growth the cast had gone through up to that point, I knew something was off and I think the cast did too as they left one after the other. | The thing is: I want the movie, but I don't want it without Donald Glover | Jonathan Banks was amazing but it wasn't enough. | He was very gifted at steel drums. | Yeah, I agree on this. It was never BAD, but he always brings something extra to the writing. | Wait. What now? | üíØ--She was the  heart and soul of the series | That show stopped being good by season 2 halfway in | I just stopped when he died | I had to take a break after Lady Sybil and then when Matthew died. | I was looking for this! I wholeheartedly agree. I rewatch every now and then, but never make it past season 3. Between him and Sybil, a good bit of the heart of the show feels gone. | Poor Cousin Matthew üòî I think he would have been a good dad. | That was my answer. I didn‚Äôt even know about a Christmas special- imagine my confusion at starting a new season on a funeral and then my friend told me. I just quit and never looked back | Forget GOT, Downton Abby wins the prize for killing off main characters! | I stopped watching when Sybil died. I stopped checking the Wikipedia summaries when Matthew died. | It just turned into a melodramatic soap after that. | Disagree I couldn't stand Matthew.¬† | Same, it was just such a soap opera twist that I lost interest. | They killed Abbie?? Whoa, I missed some stuff. I stopped watching when Betsy Ross showed up; it started to feel like they were really reaching to keep the plot going. | The Office never recovered after Steve Carrell‚Äôs departure. And his return in the finale was the highlight of that episode. | I never watched Sleepy Hollow, but I did watch Bones. When they did that weird two-part-show-jumping thing together I knew neither show was long for life. It didn't even make remote sense, those two shows together. Bones was a realistic, hard(ish) science show and Sleepy Hollow was a show about undead ghosts and other supernatural goings-on. On the Bones side, all the pragmatic scientists saw all this crazy, impossible stuff happen and were like ""huh, weird. Let's never talk about or think about that again."" | I will always be upset about how Sleepy Hollow threw everything away after that first season. From the new show runners choosing to focus more on Katrina to killing off Abbie... It was a mess all the way down. | This one will piss me off until the end of time.¬† | Sleepy Hollow was a terrible show already. | Love the girl üíØ You can doo Nothin .. | They should have done the world a favor and killed her off way sooner then. | Did they actually try to keep it going without the protagonist lol? I'm glad I checked out before that now. | It's prince Harry's fault for marrying Megan Markle and her having to leave because of the media. And messing up all the story lines | They also tried having a spin-off with Jessica. I watched like 2 episodes before quitting | Only the first three seasons were released in my country so from my perspective it went out on a high note. | I hated every Andy storyline. | The office jumped the shark almost 2 seasons before Michael left but people held on anyway. Show should have ended at Jim and Pam's wedding. | I had to scroll way too far down to see this, I thought this would be near the top given how successful The US version of The Office was. | I disagree. It took a few episodes for it to find it's new direction after he left but the Robert California season is pretty great, and the show still it some great episodes post Michael. The final season is a bit rough tho.¬† | I wouldn't call it good after Michael left, it became more subpar. | Call me crazy, but I liked it better after Michael Scott was gone | I agree and I disagree.

I *loved* Robert California. | Robert California's stint was the apex of that series. Red Reddington running an office supply company is comedy gold. | Comedy Central has several blocks of time when they play all the episodes in order. I often have one TV on in the background so I can‚Äôt hear the creaking of my old house at night, especially when I‚Äôm alone. *The Office* is something I like having on because I can pay attention to the episodes I like, and tune out the ones I don‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt really think of any episodes I pay attention to during the seasons when Andy is the manager, except towards the series finale. | echo this! | Honestly it wasn‚Äôt even still good. I remember watching seasons 8 and 9 while community and parks and rec were on and man the difference in quality. The finale of the office was great but as a whole seasons 8 and 9 were just‚Ä¶.bad and not funny. | I rewatched it recently. I have absolutely no idea why they decided to make Andy a main character. 

The first handful of episodes after Michael left were fine, then it was just a steep downhill after that. Strong performances from guest stars Will Ferrell, Kathy Bates, and [James Spader](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=8b98dd0f836117fc&sca_upv=1&rlz=1C1GCEA_enAU1089AU1089&sxsrf=ADLYWILzXrgT8vHcXYJywZ2x014uyc41uQ:1725977477446&q=James+Spader&si=ACC90nyvvWro6QmnyY1IfSdgk5wwjB1r8BGd_IWRjXqmKPQqm3Z1SzQtU-fwJ4to3uz26M7B_27bz6y6YsjU82z8vwFHCPV4r6XjngkhVNe3nR5MoF7zpaBRr1gEtuI7M4dg48_HHTeSSy2VSL7CMxYAadTmK5iLVKgs5E2ZRqU39ipyGCK5rpe1MnMYgKT5nph6pdJA0xPk&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj_zruTx7iIAxXKqFYBHXnIOtQQmxMoAHoECCIQAg) carried episodes here and there. But it was mostly just propping up a spiralling franchise. | And the reason he left was so preventable!! Heartbreaking | I stopped watching shameless once debbie started getting super annoying but wanted to pick it up again until I saw Fiona left. It's honestly crazy the show continues after she left. | I only finished it for completion, but it definitely wasn't the same show after Fiona left. | That show needed to end at season 4. | 100% the one I thought of.  Shocking how they just couldn't recover without Fiona. Not only was Debbie super annoying and lack the chops to carry the female lead but the story lines turned to social advocacy which is definitely NOT why I watched the show. | honestly i stopped watching years earlier when they sent mickey to jail and noel fisher left the show. then came back when he came back lol | I'm just watching the last season now.  I've invested so much I'm going to finish the show to the end, but wow, this last season is painful.  It is just the producers trying to stretch another season onto a once good show.  Went from plucky kids to adults making repeatedly stupid decisions. | It sucked after Fiona left ‚Ä¶. No good sex scenes anymore | This is fair, I would say though that for me what started the downward trend though was when Diane Neal left. After that they didn‚Äôt have a consistent ADA in the show for multiple seasons and even when she came back, Meloni had left by then too and the whole vibe was gone. They really needed a permanent actor for that role to help build consistent stories and relationships between all the characters. 

Meloni leaving was just the nail in the coffin. I‚Äôm surprised the show is still ongoing, but I know for a lot of fans of the show that‚Äôs where most drop it and stop watching on any rewatches. | Woah, Stabler? He‚Äôs literally the defecto cop | It got really, really bad after he left. It picked back up again after a few seasons, but it was pretty rough for awhile. | It became the ""listen to Olivia go off yet again"". 

God I hated her. | But now he has his own show which is alright if you prefer drama over the episodic format of law and order og. Too bad they're still dragging this weird love thing with Olivia Bensen after like 20 years. | I‚Äôm doing a rewatch of the series and im so sad that Munch is gone and ADA Barba, how he left broke my heart‚Ä¶ it seemed so out of character for him. | if you haven't seen ""Happy"" give it a shot. Meloni is a gem | Surely not unpopular. It was definitely never the same after he left. | I would add Dr. Wong also. Once they removed the psychoanalysis of the really dark characters, it wasn‚Äôt as chilling. | You mean Elliot Un Stabler? | No that's fair. The vibe changed. | Imagine William Lewis pulling the shit he pulled on Olivia with Stabler around. There‚Äôd be nothing left but a stain on the interrogation room floor. | I tried watching his own spin-off but couldn‚Äôt get into it | Was never a big fan of Stabler myself. When i start my rewatches of SVU, I generally start after he left | Dude never met a suspect he didn't want to brutalize. Probably the worst TV cop that wasn't on the Shield. | It's because it stopped being about the work and started being about Benson - her sudden series of promotions to captain, dating random supporting cast like the internal affairs guy, drama with her son. I love her as a character but I'm watching for the police procedural not the soap opera drama. | I think it has been uneven since he left and it sucked right after but losing BD Wong and Tamara Tunie has really taken a lot of what made that show special out of it. But I still watch.¬† | [deleted] | I never recovered. I was feral for that show and killing off Josh ended it for me | This was my mum's show and she would force my dad and I to watch it with her. When his character died? We were all crying real tears. Dad left the room to make a cup of tea so we didn't have to see him cry lol | Conversely, I think The Good Fight (technically a different show) was better for getting rid of Julianna Margulies. | Agree, the feel of the show felt off after he left. | That entire show was such a mess it felt like the writers didn‚Äôt know what story they wanted to tell. The cracks were beginning to show even before his death but his death was the end of the show basically | It did give us a great line from Nas in Popstar: ‚Äúthe only other time I remember being that sad‚Ä¶ was when they killed Josh Charles on The Good Wife‚Äù | I‚Äôve literally just finished it this week. 

I liked that Will left. The whole forbidden love issue was dragged on far too long. Especially as there was no real chemistry between the actors | It was only 1 season, then Bo and Luke came back. It was a contract thing, and the actors proved they were the reason for the good ratings. They got their pay rise. | They didn't actually leave, they just held out for more money.  They came back later but by then the show really had lost its mojo.  Coy and Vance looked like California Golden Boys, not backwoods Georgia moonshine hicks.  (OK Wopat and Schneider didn't really look the parts either, but weren't so glaringly shiny as Coy and Vance). | Wait ‚Ä¶ what?  *goes to wiki*   Holy crap, I didn‚Äôt even know that happened. | I felt like the death of Lexie Grey killed the show. She was clearly meant to transition the show from the old cast to the new cast.¬† ¬†Not to mention the way she died was a full ""jump the shark"" moment.¬†


They kept writing for the old cast until there were none left.¬† | Yooooo. I'm not familiar enough to comment on tone change but what a cool, random reminder of this show. My gf at the time and I watched it all the time during shared weekends from different colleges. That, Frisky Dingo, and Xavier: Renegade Angel. So weird, so dumb. Loved 'em all. That programming block was great. | This show was monumental for me and my sense of humor.¬†


My wifi is HappyCakeOven.¬†


I didn't realize that is what happened, but I definitely noticed a tonal shift at one point and this makes a lot of sense. | It didn't help that, as they even said during the finale, they simply weren't Aqua Teen Hunger Force. The show may have been able to find new feet but there was no way it was going to get the investment for it at that point. | Man, completely missed that Sealab 2020 was not the end. Thanks Reddit, can't wait to watch this. | The Tornado Shanks era had some moments. The Brotherhood of Neptune episode is pretty damn hilarious, for example. But you're right, Harry Goz brought the perfect note of authoritarian dumbness to Captain Murphy that really made the show come together. | Ah the great spice wars. | I immediately began singing this theme song. What a show. | As glad as I am that they didn't simply recast Captain Murphy, it really wasn't the same afterward.¬† There were some good episodes, but nothing on par with I, Robot or the time warp episode.¬†¬†


I did like that they gave it to his son, from a sentimental perspective, but the new character just didn't work well.¬†¬† | The show died when the Cro-Mags appeared. | Red Dwarf after ~~Rimmer~~ Rob Grant left. | That was only like 1 season though. | Idk why they did t ask one of the Hollies to return. | I was so mad after I watched that episode, I stopped watching the show immediately! | Yeah I remember falling off after he died. Then I got even more pissed for the reasoning they killed him off. | The real nail in the coffin was Lahey‚Äôs death.  John Dunsworth. | Yeah that show jumped the shark, got a little better, and then just fizzled for another several seasons.


At the point the actor for Jim Lahey died I hadn't realized they were even still making it and had been for a while. I watched a little. Some of it was okay. | You can say ‚Äúfuck‚Äù on Reddit. No need to stupidly censor it. | Are you saying TPB failed? | I still enjoy the later seasons even if they arent as great. | Wait, you're telling me the show had a season without the main POV character of the books?!! | I kept wondering if they were actually going to bring Quentin back but I think that season ended up wrapping up the stories of the other characters. They all continually evolved throughout the series. That‚Äôs something the show did well. | The funeral scene had me crying.  I want them to play a showed down version of ""take on me"" at my funeral ever since I watched that. | I always stall before the S4 finale, both to get up the emotional resilience, but also because S5's plot is all over the place. That said, it did have some fantastic bits. Eliot dealing with post-Monster life, learning to be his own person without Margo, and The Mountain of Ghosts...God, I watch them at the top of the mountain almost as much as I watch A Life In The Day.

Honourable mention for the finding Hades playing Untitled Goose Game. | Yeah, they had a natural narrative end to the show at the end of season 4, and they should have closed it there. Nice that Penny got some growth later but the 5th season was pretty pointless. | Loved Q and it wasn‚Äôt the same without him. | Yeah, that last season was pretty pointless.  Should've just ended it with the bonfire. | I stopped watching that show *because* of him. I'm gonna check out this season without him | TPB will never not be The Pirate Bay to me. | You did good. I never got through the final two seasons. | I assume you mean the US remake? Fiona was only in one Season of the original AFAIR | If we want to pinpoint it I‚Äôd say after Charles Dance was no longer in it. In a show filled with standout performances his was truly fantastic. The show peaked during S4, including Tywin‚Äôs death. 

His absence was noticeable. There are a lot of other reasons it went downhill, but I‚Äôm convinced he could have tricked me into thinking the show might be great again. | Amen. As much as I loved the show, or maybe because I loved it so much, I feel like they should have ended it when David duchovny left | Wow that‚Äôs a blast from the past. I loved that show but haven‚Äôt thought about it in years | becker crawled so house could run


the show went wildly away from the original premise pretty quickly. but it was a good ride | The best answer | At least they brought it to a conclusion instead of just letting it fade away. | God. That show blew from day one. I watch that with my grandma when I visit her. She loves it. I never laugh. Nothing about that show is funny. It amazes me that anyone finds that corny crap funny. | I hated his character.  Such a whiny little bitch, selfish as hell, and needing to be told to go fuck himself 20 times an episode. | Any idea why he quit? | I fucking hate BBT but absolutely adored Young Sheldon | I know people like that show, and I do find some of the bits to be funny, but I never loved that you were usually laughing AT the guys (especially Sheldon) rather than WITH. 

Someone once said it's a show ABOUT smart people. In comparison, they said Community was a show FOR smart people. 

Maybe I just hate laugh tracks, so that could be part of it. | I didn‚Äôt know that‚Äôs why it ended. | Thank god he did so the show could die. Most unfunny laughtrack bloated garbage I've seen. | Disagree. The first season stands head and shoulders above the rest, yes, but that's not due to the recasting of the lead. It was just a difficult transition from gladiator school to outright rebellion, that they pulled off about as well as could be expected (and hence why the prequel season was arguably the next best they produced). The replacement Spartacus did a great job. | The prequel season was fantastic, though. | Nah. Andy was great, but Liam also made the role his own. It helped that Andy‚Äôs storyline was centralized in Batiatus gladiator school and then Liam‚Äôs storyline was centralized outside in a war against the Roman‚Äôs. Even then pivoting and doing the prequel season after Andy‚Äôs death was a smart move.

Overall it was a really good show. | Helped for me that Andy hand picked Liam to succeed him in the role. Definitely wasn't the same, but the show went downhill for so many different reasons. Prequel season was fantastic though. | Ah man this one hurts | Gonna disagree with that one.  It would have been better if Andy could have stayed, but it was still good.

I didn't care for the actress that replaced Navea though. | I think they did as well as they could. Certainly season 1 was the best because of the actor, but the show was still damn good once the new actor settled in. | Yea, I agree it was basically impossible to replace Andy, but I think Liam was great and did about as well as anyone possibly could. So I wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äòruined‚Äô but I can see where you‚Äôre coming from. | Putas madre | ‚ÄúOne of the actors died‚Ä¶‚Äù

Is such an understatement to it. He was beloved during that period. | Phil Hartman didn't just die; he was murdered. ‚òπÔ∏è | Phil Hartman | Fuck Andy Dick¬† | Yeah. That show needed Phil Hartman. I loved that show the first 4 seasons | I fondly remember this show. Joe Rogan's character was actually funny then. | Did you just call Phil Hartman ""one of the actors""

Disrespectful /j | Interesting case, usually this happens only when the main actor dies. The show could have theoretically survived without Phil Hartman, but didn't. | Literally yesterday I finished watching the last episode of the 5th season in my rewatch. Max doesn't hold a candle to Bill. | No more Mrs. Krabappel.  No more Apu. | YES came here to see if anybody mentioned  Grissom leaving CSI. The seasons with Laurence Fishburne as Langston are still decent but once Ted Danson shows up‚Ä¶ugh üòù | CSI had some rocky seasons after Grissom, but Ted Danson did a good job of bringing it back. It was when the original cast started to leave the last couple of seasons that the show jumped the shark. | Knowing who he ended up with, Grissom could have stayed gone. Ugh. | NCIS went bad when Ziva left.  Then when Abby left, there was no heart to the show any more. | Yeah absolutely. So much they had to beg him to come back for the last season just for a chance to fix and it still didn‚Äôt work. I think he had wanted to leave the character and had some issues getting back into it. | It‚Äôs cool, so did Homeland. | I loved the original *Prisoner*. 

When [Bea](https://prisonercellblockh.fandom.com/wiki/Bea_Smith) left in that it was a huge loss which (for me) was difficult to come back from, despite some great cast additions like Anne Phelan and Glenda Linscott. | I finished the show, but damn that was rough | I didn't know people could die in golf tournaments. | I came searching directly for this one. I was a big Seth and Summer fan, but Mischa Barton carried that show. I feel like they made such a mistake going for shock value. She had the perfect opportunity to get on her dad‚Äôs boat and never come back. | Never forget üò≠ | I blame this one on them really trying to push Marissa‚Äôs
little sister as a character in season 4. She really just couldn‚Äôt act and her scenes were a PAIN to sit through | Please expound upon this, sir. I remember loving the show, but since its not available to watch anywhere, I don't remember who left or why. | scrolled down to find this. When Rob Morrow left right? Fleishmann | I'm surprised he didn't have much of a career afterwards. He was great in Quiz Show as well. I'm guessing quitting NE kind of got him blacklisted. | Agree.  I've watched all of session 6, but wish I would have stopped with The Quest; the last episode with Rob Morrow/Joel Fleischmann.  The Quest should have been the series finale. | Thankfully it was only the last season. | And two other characters left. Taking all the Brain cells with them | I was such a fan of that show! | That show was brilliant! 

I loved the 80‚Äôs version, but the one in 2003(?) ish was brilliant. | I don't think that's because she left. The writing and stories just got bad after Trinity. Dexter's problem was it threw away its best characters way too early, Ice Truck, Doakes, Trinity. | The original showrunner (Clyde Phillips) and some of the writers as well all left after the fourth season, and Scott Buck (who has destroyed countless franchises) took over. | I'm convinced that they just saw the growing numbers for the show ( the 4th season was the most watched/most popular overall) and got greedy and figured that they had to do something bold and interesting. 

They tried for a while after Rita died, but the show just was, too... dramatic after that. They tried too hard, but I did like the revival/closure of the New Blood addition. 

Especially because they added Angel in the end ‚ô° | On rewatch, it kind of sucks outside of season 1 and 4.¬† | I love her.  Cannot watch the Dexter eps after her.  They are missing something.

The writers and Michaael did a great job of humanizing him, and then threw it all away. | i mean...the story/show should've been over with the cliff hanger we got at the end of 4. there's no recovery from that. it was top tier television. no season after came close to that. | Hell yeah. Season 4 was the last great season. I don‚Äôt understand how anyone likes those terrible seasons that came after | It wasn't that.   
  
Like others say, the quality went down after season 4. I think a big factor was they spent a lot of screen time on guest stars who'd leave after the season ended and didn't develop the supporting cast, the characters who'd stick around, so why would you give a shit about them? | No, his daughter. He had a daughter, and he wanted to be a hands-on parent. As she got older, he returned to the series, and even guest-starred in the other shows. | This is what I came to say. 

Currently watching it with my wife. She grew up on this show and loves it, so she wanted me to watch it too. We‚Äôre about halfway through season nine. I like it, and Mitchell is a pretty cool character, but Jack was so great, and the show just feels kinda empty now. Same with the departure of Don S Davis as General Hammond. I like the new guy well enough, but Hammond of Texas was such a badass. | I'm one of the few that loved SG:U. Loved it. Watched it with a girlfriend at the time, and at the end of season 2, she asked, ""when is the next one season?"". Her face when I told her that it was cancelled was the same face someone makes witnessing a puppy being kicked. 

It's a shame. The series could've gone *so much further*. Bonnie Hammer did a lot of damage to the Scifi network, from making it about ghost hunting and wrestling, canceling MST3K, and otherwise killing the channel. I think it was around the cancellation of SGU that I went ahead and got rid of cable altogether. | It was still great, but dang if it didn't kill the show when he left. | Scrolled WAY too far to see this. | Are you lamenting the departure of Christmas Snow? 

(Jennifer lee is too adorable to not forgive, and I always liked Terry)

  
or the follow up series Three's a Crowd? | What character did she play? The MI6 supervisor? | Hell, my wife never got over them replacing the older daughter after the first season. | That had more to due with the fact that LMS had been cancelled by ABC and in the time between it getting picked up by Fox, the actress who played Mandy signed on to other projects that she couldn‚Äôt get out of. | He did die in the source material, say what you want about shock value. Lori and her newborn die brutally as well. | I kept watching.


In fact, that scene elevated the show for me as it lifted Negan to new heights.


I think most people did too. And some of those who left might have been more bothered by *how* Glenn died than *that* he died. It was perhaps too gruesome for most people‚Äôs sensibilities. I‚Äôd argue the same people would have left if a less popular character had died in the same fashion. | Yeah I kinda lost interest in it too after Ragnar died | Agreed. I stopped watching soon after. | Losing him was really bad yeah | I stopped after season 3. Once it became less about the parks and more about the world outside of it, I stopped caring | Doesn't look like anything to me. | He literally has a role in season 2 | The notion that Ritter, a comedy genius, could be replaced by such as dud as David spade, is ludicrous. | The writers‚Äô biggest regret to this day is killing off Misha Barton‚Äôs character. The ratings completely tanked the next season and the previously hit show was cancelled. The writers have claimed that the network made them do it; that Fox demanded that a major character be killed off in the finale of Season 3 so they could ‚Äúgenerate buzz.‚Äù  They generated buzz alright. | I liked season 4. Autumn Reeser was great. | nah pretty common one | Oliver was a poor Jeff replacement character. | Same! | Those bastards! | You made this whole list and didn‚Äôt include when Shirley left ‚ÄúLavern and Shirley.‚Äù | *Welcome Back Kotter* really wasn't the same w/o Kotter. He had serious issues with the producers but it wasn't about a contract, at least not the financial part of it.  

The entire show was based on his stand-up routine and his comedy writing.  He felt as though it was his show and wanted creative control. The producers wouldn't give it to him. Specifically, a couple of the Sweathogs actors were approaching 30 years old, and he thought it was ridiculous they were supposed to be still in high school. He wrote a rough draft script & storyline about them graduating and going to a community college, but the producers rejected it. So he quit. | I watched all of Boy Meets World for the first time last year and I was shocked by Mr. Turner's sudden motorcycle accident. There was NOTHING after that to indicate whether or not he survived until that high school graduation episode where they bring back Minkus for the first time since season one and he just goes, ""Hi Mr. Turner!"" and just goes off camera. That moment felt like a slap in the face to me because I agree with you that Mr. Turner was so important, the relationship developing between him and Shawn was compelling, and the show just hand-waved him away. Then cue in the nonsense with Cory and Topanga's marriage, ugh. | Good one. I despise the last season of Friends. Which is a shame since Paul Rudd is in that season. | Add ER & George Clooney Juliana Margulies, Eriq LaSalle and Noah Wylie. | Whaaaaat i have watched friends multiple times and never knew that chandler wanted out. Was that also the reason it ended at 10 seasons? | I rewatched all of Dynasty on DVD. While I really missed Pamela Sue Martin after she left and disliked the recasts of Alexis and Blake's children, the loss of Linda Evans damaged the show the most. It really upset the balance and even though Sable came in that wasn't enough. And Krystle's leaving story involved [Virginia Metheny](https://carringtondynasty.fandom.com/wiki/Virginia_Metheny)  - easily my most-disliked Dynasty character. | Boy Meets World - Turner‚Äôs last scene was him in hospital in the episode ‚ÄúCult Fiction‚Äù, the penultimate season 4 episod. He was also referred to by Minkus in s05e24, ‚ÄúGraduation‚Äù. They talk about losing Anthony Tyler Quinn (Mr Turner) on the Pod Meets World podcast. | This dude shows. | Wise words, oh ancient one. | And John Schneider leaving the Dukes of Hazard | > Barney Miller - Why did they get rid of Abe Vigoda? He was an important part of the show

Abe Vigoda was offered his own show called *Fish*.  It was about Fish and Bernice dealing with Fish's retirement and becoming foster parents to a bunch of orphans.  There's a couple  backdoor pilot episodes of *Barney Miller* introducing two of the kids.

*Fish* wasn't terrible, but it really wasn't very good, either.  It was pretty much a one-joke show (grumpy man dealing with bratty kids).  The kids grew up fast in two seasons and it kinda didn't make sense anymore.  I think it lasted about 30 episodes in total.

Fish comes back for a few guest appearances on *Barney Miller* and they are some highlight episodes of the later seasons.

Fortunately, the departure of Fish from *Barney Miller* really expanded Dietrich's role on the show and he really brought a whole new dimension to the squad room. | > Happy Days - The only cast member to stay on the show the entire time besides the parents was Fonzie and Potsie, everyone else left the show...Spike, Richie, Ralph, Chachi, Joannie...yes Joannie and Chachi came back in the last season, but it was not the same.

That show wasn't the same after Richie's brother Chuck left. | Happy Days failed when they got rid of Chuck :) | It was definitely different, but the final season with Paget made me wish she was in the show earlier. | I didn‚Äôt mind the episodes after he left but yeah it lost a bit of the magic. Season 4 was the worst season of the show and he was on that one. | You mean Dong Lover? | I liked the whole series, but it definitely got a little bit worse with every departure. 3 of the original 7 left by the end. Say what you will about Chevy Chase, but I personally think he was the biggest loss. | Also chevy eventhough he wasnt liked by a lot of the cast he was good on the show | IKR? They kept hiring sexy blonde women, who weren‚Äôt funny. And I thought the firing was unfair, because IIRC, Somers was dealing with a stalker, which had to affect her mental state. | It was fucking awful to be fair. | Agreed.  I really liked that show.  I thought Debra Winger was a miscast, but everything else was good.  I tried re-watching it this summer and I couldn't get past Rooster being a real-life rapist. | Definitely was not the same when Fiona left. Annie was cool but Fi was very... different...? I guess Annie was too cute/pretty and they were replacing the geek/nerd/weirdo which i aligned more with. (Im reading that Cara wanted to leave to pursue other projects :< ) | I didn't know anyone on the show died.

We'd watch it after playing VtM.  We also called it ""Kindred: The Embarrassment"". | It was a terrible show with a fantastic actor in it. Sad. :( | I agree, but I have to give props to Ron Howard for accepting that it was fast becoming The Fonzie Show, and going his own way. Had he stayed, we might not have the movie Apollo 13. | TJ Miller made that show for sure | It was already failing once they were leaving school really, but Cory Monteith‚Äôs death really affected it. Rachel is just insufferable without Finn. I think it should have ended there and not tried to limp on for so long afterwards. | Yeah I‚Äôm surprised I haven‚Äôt seen this yet but there is a noticeable difference after it happens. | They did poor Frank dirty. | Amen | Oh, that last season was excruciating. They gave it a helluva try, but it was just ‚Ä¶ pointless ‚Ä¶ without Frank Underwood. | How did he leave the show, did they kill his character off? | I saw the hype around Yellowstone and I actually like Kevin Costner in shows. Started watching but what a disappointment it turned out to be. Probably the worst writing ever..!!! Must be brain dead to sit through this drivel. It was one crisis to the next.... but not like it fitted a realistic story line. I pushed through  until ep.9 s.1 but when, in one episode, the blue eyed boy went from favourite to outcast, lousy daughter to running the business, environmental agent (lady) falls of horse, gets impaled by fence post, walks to helicopter, etc. I just thought, who are these moron writers? | Came here to say this. They replaced him with an awkward Steven Moffat insert who wasn‚Äôt funny and kinda ruined season 4. | It was a good run and a solid ending. | I like Natalie fine but yeah I prefer Sharon‚Äôs too. | I think that >!Sharona ending up with Randy!< in the series end was a great surprise twist that I honestly never saw as a possibility back in the first few seasons, although looking back it makes sense.

In the Monk subreddit there are ""Sharona or Natalie"" debates all the time and I always find it interesting to read about why people like one or the other better. | Dr. Kroger dying was a much bigger impact on the show.  Natalie did incredibly well. | Unknown Hinson was fired for saying the most squidbillies shit, feels like them casting Tracy Morgan as Early was meant to be a final F.U. to him and fans | George Segal passing away should‚Äôve been the natural endpoint of the show. | Is that what happened? That's some BS. | I had to scroll way too long to find this. YES! it was never the same without her. | Funny thing is, I really like Jo Anderson's potential to grow into something really interesting, but it was too hard to pivot the writing after the epic storyline for Hamilton's departure.

The story ended and you can't continue after such a clearcut ending. | At least he was in the movie. | Scrolled too far to see this. Though I haven't even seen 'The Conners' which seems to still be going with 6 seasons. | I think it will soon... | nah, that's just funny to me. Cavill chose to leave the role because there was a ""possibility"" that he'd be cast in the new Superman series. He didn't get it, and the creator/writer basically tweeted 'lmao we were never considering him because this is a different story and we didn't want the same actor. also we didn't reach out to him - he just assumed he got the role lol.' Like. throwing away a steady gig for the potential role that you weren't even going to get? sucks to be you henry. | I didn't know they tried to do the show without him. 
Did he leave the show, or was he fired? | Absolutely a wonderful show! | Totally agree. I lost all interest after they killed her. | I see what you did there

(Slow clap) | Ahh Matt Pat. The internet just isn't the same. | Felt like we just got over losing Coach, then Diane left. | People keep saying this, but we haven't seen a season without him yet. It might be great. But we'll never know because people are so intent on hating it before it even exists. | These 2/3 year gaps between seasons , when shows are only about 10 episodes to begin with,  is something I don't understand | Oh damn, I didn't know it was canceled, that sucks. They left us hanging | US. 

The original ‚ÄòOffice‚Äô UK was a masterpiece from beginning to end. | I absolutely love how it ended ended though. | Yeah, the heart really went out of that show when Helen McCrory passed. | lol he plays the same guy in love actually. | I wish he‚Äôd come back. Such a great actor | Yup - I always said ‚Äúno Hotch, no watch.‚Äù | I know, it was sad to see a show with an intact family be treated in that way. | I agree! I actually didn‚Äôt discover this show until recently being an insomniac and reruns on late night cable tv, but I‚Äôve watched the series several times through now, lol, and it‚Äôs just not quite the same after Anna Faris is gone. | Great series ending though. At least the realization of the final scene.

I think it might have survived without Mitchell, but not without Mitchell and George. | It had its moments but yes, it just wasn‚Äôt the same | Sad days. | The cast didn't leave the show, the show left the cast | El chapulin colorado! | That was the stupid plot. Mitchell and Vala - just watch Farscape! | +1 Came here for that!
Though to be honest, the whole atmosphere (and probably budget) was changed in the second season so I‚Äôm not sure if even Kinnaman would‚Äôve been able to save it‚Ä¶ | I think this show has a showrunner problem rather than a casting problem, but I'm also one of the legacy fans who stopped watching in the Capaldi years, so what do I know. | I haven't watched since halfway through Peter Capaldi's doctor. For me it seems the writing went downhill. Eccelston, Tenant, Smith, Capaldi were all great, but somewhere the writing took a turn. | That season w/ just Damon Wayans is so cringe | Why is this unpopular? It's the truth | Right? | You're really trying to say MASH only had 3 good seasons?

Season 9 almost every episode was in the top 10 in ratings, and for the year it was 4th highest rated of all shows.  Two years later, the series finale was the most watched episode of any series in television history at the time.

""Complete and utter failure"" my ass. | I was riveted by Wentworth when I found it. I think there were 3 seasons at the time. I was house-sitting for someone and I absolutely did not leave the house because I just watched every episode available. | When JD left was the end of the show. We do not recognize season 9 as cannon. | There was the time Kings of Leon walked off the stage because [a bird pooped on the bassist.](https://www.riverfronttimes.com/music/lets-remember-when-some-birds-pooped-on-kings-of-leon-in-st-louis-35017692) | [deleted] | Edit:  Danny Masterson | >I've not seen a single episode with Kutcher.

You haven't missed anything.  He's a decent actor, but he just doesn't fit that show at all. | Salve. Wasn't expecting the show to get a mention here | Andy had a lot of potential at first as a teachable idiot.  Then they completely assassinated his character. | I preferred the later seasons with Terri but I think it's more because Don Knotts  as Mr. Furley was funnier than The Ropers . | No it‚Äôs not. That‚Äôs another Law and Order. Organised Crime I think | Angela was incredibly annoying. 50 C was good. Couldve been kind of a great show though if it werent for all those long filler sex scenes. | So why if that‚Äôs the case aren‚Äôt you trumpers happy ? Hmmm guess your gonna be real sad when you‚Äôre calling her madam president | I agree completely. IMO it's one of those shows where you can literally just scroll through episodes at random until you find one that has an interesting plot description, and you're going to enjoy that standalone episode from the writing and the characters alone. My favorite episode is ""Home"" and literally anyone who's into creepy crime dramas can watch and love this episode with absolutely no context from the rest of the show. | It should have stayed 'monster of the week'.¬†


The main plot arc sucked. | ""The suds are out there."" | One episode was written by Vince Gilligan, who cast Bryan Cranston as the antagonist. Gilligan was apparently so impressed by the way Cranston humanized the character that, less than a decade later, he would cast him as Walter White in *Breaking Bad.* There are a couple of other instances of people who worked so well together on *X* that they went on to do future projects, but I can‚Äôt think of any off the top of my head. | This is hilarious | The straightforward episodic stuff was the best, the overarching narrative could have been cool, but it never fully worked out. They never should have lost the feel of having a weird new case each week in the foreground while keeping the overarching narrative running in the background. | Regarding casting: 

Did you know that Fox originally fought Chris Carter over Gillian being cast as Scully? 

They wanted sexier. Bombshell. 

They literally wanted Pamela Anderson. 

Now, all love to PA but that would have been a very different show‚Ä¶ thank god Carter fought for Gillian. She was a revelation for us millennial babies. | I actually never watched the x files until after Mulder was gone, so that‚Äôs how I got to know the show. It‚Äôs definitely still pretty good, but I was spared that big change distracting me | The episode with the half man/half bat is the highlight of the new pair for me. Great monster of the week ep | I think there's a lot of good to very good late season episodes.¬† The only real issue to me is the chemistry.¬† Duchovny and Anderson had one of the best natural dynamics in the history of tv, and that carried the show when the stories were mediocre, even boring episodes were watchable.¬† Late season the writing had to just carry more weight, so it felt worse overall. | Agreed - it went downhill when Duchovny left, but it would have been a good show still with Doggit. If Anderson had left instead, it would have been worse. I've been rewatching the show from the start, and it's clear by about midway through the pre-LA seasons that she was the anchor for the show. | I liked Doggett a lot, but he couldn't carry the show. I would have loved him as a recurring character, like once a season Mulder and Scully work a case alongside Doggett | It never sat with me right that Doggit became the Scully act, while Scully became the Mulder act. Then Scully just flip flops back once Mulder returns. | He was only in a handful of episodes in the penultimate season (really great episodes though) and then didn‚Äôt appear until the 2 hour series finale. Then he was in the 2nd movie that came out years after the show ended and the 2 ‚Äúreboot‚Äù seasons a few years back. So he was really only gone for about a season and half. | I remembered it. Charlie Sheen couldn't replace MJF, and then he went on to do a show where he could not be replaced. | Connor Roy was interested in local politics from a very young age. | I haven't thought about that show in ages.¬† But when I read the name just now, I was thinking David Spade was in it.¬† Looked it up and that was Just Shoot Me...another one I completely forgot about.¬† I think they aired back to back. | I enjoyed that show, even though I was a teenager when it was on. | I find it goes in and out of the collective memory | Great show | I remember it was fun. I barely remember what it was about. | I loved it! | I remember that show being the king of suddenly disappearing its characters without warning or explanation | Pepperidge Farms remembers. | Tell me how you know I do? | I honestly don't see much of a difference in Spin City as opposed to anything else he was in around the same time or even before.

In his autobiography Lucky Man, he did mention having to put his hand in his pocket to cover up some finger twitching. I thought that was his normal stance but it's noticeable at times having read his book. Otherwise, I'm surprised anyone could tell without saying the same for For Love or Money or Doc Hollywood. | Yes. I had to rewatch this series for my job once (cool job at the time), and knowing he left because of his Parkinson‚Äôs you can see it, how he caters to his twitches. It‚Äôs very easy to miss if you don‚Äôt know, especially since he always plays awkward-ish (yet charming) characters anyway.

Funnily enough I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs similar to knowing about Charlie Sheens drug/alcohol abuse on the set of TaaHM too can see how he caters to his‚Ä¶ destruction. | They tried to power on with Jon Lovitz stepping in, but Phil Hartman was just too much of what made that show. | Man, i need to start doing some rewatches of these classics. NewsRadio was one of my favorites as was Spin City, but I haven't seen either since they were on the air. | I think with that as your onboarding point, it would definitely be all good. Coming from the other side, it was hard to be so far in a show and have come to know the main character so well only for us to reset and follow someone new.

I think to, the circumstances of Michael j Fox having to leave just put a sombre air on the whole thing and that was hard to get out from under. | It actually wasn‚Äôt bad with David Spade and James Garner. | Now you're making me question what my mom told me about my cat. | Not only that but in my opinion they did a fantastic job of it. That so easily could have come off as a bad move, like they were trying to profit directly from his death, but thanks to the care they put in it came off so beautifully. You could feel the genuine pain from the actors when they cried, they weren‚Äôt acting like they were crying, they were just crying, they‚Äôd been given an outlet and were taking it. | He was the main character, it would have been weird to ignore it. | Note: Jon Ritter died on the way back to his home planet. | Wasn‚Äôt one of his last movies Bad Santa?. | I got the impression that final season was made purely to ensure to production team got a paycheck. From memory they were so deep into pre-production that cancellation would have left a huge number of staff in limbo, so they just churned out one more season, recycling as much as they could from their original plans, with no plans for a 6th.¬†


This may, however, be an urban myth I'm taking at face value. | I did love the way they just stone cold killed him off camera between seasons, though. President Underwood? Oh, he died. | They actually had some good ideas, just poorly executed. | Where they left things at the end of season 5 was a perfect place for her to take over into the last season. But the execution was just so terrible... | you're in luck because he went crazy and posts videos in character now. | I think the pacing of the first two seasons was spot on, to be honest. The original series got Urquhart into No 10 in 4 episodes after all.¬†


The issue was with the lack of an exit plan. The original series ends with the lead taking power, and never has to answer the question of ""now what?"" And the newer series seemed to fall into the trap of only looking one season ahead, jumping from renewal to renewal, rather than planning to tell a coherent story and then ending on their own terms.


House of Cards should have had lasted 3-4 seasons only, ending intentionally with a final fall from grace. It's impossible to keep the writing as tight as the early seasons when you have no clear end goal other than another season of survival. | I don't think they put him in the White House too soon. I think the issue was more that they had him in the White House *too long*. The show was meant to be three acts: his rise, him achieving his goal, and his comeuppance. Once they got him in the White House, they were just unwilling to move onto the final act, so it just became them spinning their wheels and increasingly convoluted problems for Frank to have to deal with. 

Realistically, the show would've been excellent with a tight four seasons. Put him in the White House, but then immediately show his corruption starting to catch up to him until he can't fend it off anymore and is taken down. | Exactly. HoC was on the decline before Spacey left tbh. Him gone was just the last draw | Yeah seasons 1-2 were amazing. Season 3 I think we got bored halfway through and moved on. | >I dont know if they could keep if up anyway, they put him in the White house way too fast.¬† It‚Äôs like if Tom caught Jerry at the end of season 2.

Good analogy. I usually go with a dog chasing a car. But yeah, the best part of the show was Frank‚Äôs scheming and manipulations to reach the Oval Office. Once he rapped his hand on the Resolute desk‚Ä¶.now what? | Also they never made Spacey's Frank a real winner like the original UK Francis.  The original version had Francis as the greatest PM in the history of England, lasted longer than thatcher.  Kevin Spacey's character was barely keeping his head above water after season 1.  The US version doesn't hold a candle to the UK version. | The plan made perfect sense originally. Get him to the White House at the end of season 2. Season 3 is about him dealing with and struggling to maintain power. Season 4 is about his fall. 4 seasons of 13 episodes = 52 episodes = a deck of cards. It was perfect and wouldn‚Äôt have been ruined because Spacey made it through 4 seasons anyways. 

Then they went and completely derailed everything. | So you could say House of Cards was actually just a house of cards. | Perhaps they thought Robin Wright could carry it. 

She couldn‚Äôt. | Damn, that's wild. Sounds like he can make a comeback if the legal systems cleared him in multiple countries. | And a least one case was found to have falsified evidence against him. | Calling accusations ""weak"" because a guy with lots of resources was able to beat them in court is pretty hasty. | This doesn't mention his accusers (all three) died by unrelated means. And he posted videos as Frank Underwood that were weird and challenging to the public. | So the show turned to shit for nothing. Cool | This is just some slick PR work has he‚Äôs been trying to enter back into the space. 

Go look into the specific allegations. There‚Äôs a lot against the guy. Here‚Äôs an older article you can read but there‚Äôs plenty more:

https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/11/07/kevin-spacey-scandal-complete-list-13-accusers/835739001/ | This is why people need to look into things independently. The news lies, people make up their minds before knowing the facts of everything. We basically are living in a time where everything seems like high school gossip and people actually believe it | Calling him a complete asshole is quite reductive. | This. I stopped watching sometime during the last Spacey season because it was just becoming too stupid. Also, I remember they had a full on Samsung commercial as a scene in an episode at some point. | Yeah do people not remember this? At one point he literally pushes the Secretary of State down like three stairs and she ends up in a coma. The president. And no one knows or figures it out. Insane. | Can't beat the original. Francis Urquhart is the greater evil bastard | There‚Äôs no way anyone else could have ever filled that role. Spacey was the main character for 5 seasons straight and also couldn‚Äôt have possibly been more perfectly cast. | Yeah the show was about Eric. ¬†He was the main character. ¬†Once you lose him, you lose what held the show together.¬† | I mean the whole show was based in ERIC's basement. once he left it was kind of just like all over the place. Hide is black now.. Kelso is like straigtening up... Donna is hooking up with some dude.. and Jackie and Fez got together... not even the same show anymore | Don't let the writers off that easy. It wasn't just Eric, Eric and Kelso left at the same time(ish) and they tried to do a 2 for 1 replacement with Randy and failed on both ends. There might not have been a ""good"" way to move forward without Eric and Kelso, but they chose the worst way forward. | especially for all the characters to still be hanging out in Eric's basement without him | The writers absolutely f‚Äôd up by adding that new guy. Everyone acted like they liked him while he was the most annoying person they could have added. | I rewatch that 70‚Äôs show mostly every winter. I always skip the last season minus Ep. 1 and the last two.. had they found a way to keep Topher for that 8th season and finished the storylines proper, the way they wrapped the show would of been perfect and would of been a top 10 series finale. | Wdym? That 70s Show ONLY had 7 seasons. And they were all good. There's no season 8. | The writers could have done much better. That final season should have been the show's denouement with the gang slowly moving on with their lives, you know, growing up. Towards the end a scene with Kitty or Red realizing that the basement is just a basement with our realization that we haven't seen it for a few episodes. | What?? .  Didn't the show end with him going to Africa?  I haven't watched it since it was on TV over 10 years ago. | Yeah, for some reason I really started noticing things changing in the show around when Donna went blonde. If I remember right, they changed her character a lot after that. | Yeah season 7 is unwatchable for me too | There were only four seasons, right?

I mean there were four more after that but it really wasn't the same, right?  Lost all its appeal/charm?  Characters personalities pretty much all changed?  Illogical hookups?  Tried to add the Late Pregnancy trope?  Jackie's mom came back but was played by a completely different actress?

Right? | They turned him into such a weirdo like what | The Fatso Burger episode was good. | It‚Äôs the name of a show ‚ÄúThat 70s Show‚Äù a parody sitcom about the 70s that was made in the 90s | Donna's little sister...just disappeared... | i am genuinely at least 50% convinced that they will scrap the whole thing. | Two??? Why? How could they possibly believe people are going to watch this in 4 years? | Wasn't it always meant to only be 5 seasons? | I could see them wrapping up the whole series in 2. The pacing of the books is quite slow in the last few books and to make better TV they could accelerate much of it. Just wait and see how all the fans complain about the ending. I was quite pissed to read the ending myself as it‚Äôs a massive let down narratively if taken literally, but even taken metaphorically the ending is still a let down. I won‚Äôt say anymore for the sake of spoiling anything and I‚Äôm in my phone and I don‚Äôt know how to do spoiler hidden text. | Doesn't mean it won't fail within mere days of the new stuff with Liam in it drops. The reason I'm skeptical about it's success isn't that Henry Cavill was that good, and he was, but because of WHY he left, which is the producers moving away from source material and having him do things Geralt wouldn't have done. | even though I enjoyed the first season the Time skips without any sort of warning or knowledge was a big punch in the face. but the season two doesnt use the format. | How can a show about a droll, ass-kicking superhuman who fights monsters be so *boring*?  It's just so amazingly boring.  If they did away with any plot and just said ""and now Geralt fights a, I don't know, have we done drowners yet?  Ok, a drowner."" it would be a better show than it is currently. | It was barely held together in the first place IMO, the time jumps were confusing unless you were binging (seriously try to watch one episode a week of that show and tell me I'm wrong) and then the writing declined and then Cavill left.


Why even bother making it anymore. | Tenuous is generous. The writing was plummeting to dog shit depths. | You didn't miss all that much. The end of Season 2 begins falling apart pretty fast. | You didn't miss anything. We tried the new season and it was a witch soap opera mixed with really boring politics and even shittier wigs. Why did the hair get worse every season?¬† | Was pretty good until then though with him in it | I'm in the exact same boat. Once I heard Cavill left (and I was mainly watching because I felt he would keep it true and good), I just stopped. I don't want to watch another show that doesn't have an actual end. | Huh, I didn't finish season 2 because it as awful. | Same! | I knew things were going to get bad when they were bragging that some members in the writers room hated the books | They hire people to write fan fiction. It's really that simple, like, did you ever wonder what happened to that kid who used to write shit and post it Tumblr and stuff back in the day? All that weird Buffy the Vampire slayer fanfic where she started killing humans and somehow became evil? Or was Sherlock really Moriarty the whole time? Yep, they are all writers at Amazon and Netflix.

Rule 1 of that school of writing is to establish the characters to be similar but not exactly as they are in the story or lore. 

Rule 2 use those slight differences you wrote in to make them unrecognizable so you can tell your stories as you want them.

Rule 3 blame people for not getting it. Because God forbid the fans of the OG material are upset shit doesn't make any earthly sense anymore. 

As an example that has been talked to death in The Witcher season 2 they invite a ton of whores to Kaer Morhen, a secret place that at its height of the power of the Wolf was a hard place to find much less be invited to but now as a shelter for the last of the Witchers in this moment fuck it HOOKERS! then Eskel (an experienced and trusted Witcher) is doing the old ""hide the zombie bite"" clich√©. Leading to very little payoff for all this nonsense and just annoying people.

There are interesting ways to add to the lore certainly but it always feels like these writers just don't have any respect for the universe they write in. They all have an ego where they just know they are a better writer than whomever wrote and popularized this universe. But most of them mistake being clever and having complexity in a character with ""let's make them do this out of character thing because no one will expect it aren't we clever"" | They did the same thing with Bridgerton Season 3. Absolutely killed a series that I loved after reading the books for forever because the writers want to tell fanfiction. | Because netflix is californian, and the most important thing is no men get to make any input in any decisions. | Agreed. Season one was very promising. Didnt even finish the second season it got real dumb real quick.. | This. I loved S1, but didn‚Äôt make it pass episode 3 of S2. | Yeah this isn't a show that failed cause the actor left, this was an actor leaving because the show failed, not in any part due to him, but the writers. | It failed around episode 2. | That‚Äôs why Cavill left. | And not just any warhammer.  So fucking stoked | I loved the books, but I have to agree. The story kinda stalled, and it started to focus on politics between characters that weren't the main focus previously, and it really started to drag. Geralt was featured less and less, which was an odd choice. I liked the last one (AFAIK), which is a prequel, and you get to follow Geralt doing Geralt stuff. 

I enjoyed Netflix's interpretation of the stories and the new stuff they added. Cavill was absolutely great imo, and so was the actress playing Ciri. I was looking forward to seeing how they would change things up in the later books until Cavill left, as my interest also then left. | Well the game worked with the same source material and that was a masterpiece | liam hemsworth | Especially since they first made him a victim by having Izzie leave without a word. Then he goes and does the same! | So I remember reading that they didn‚Äôt plan for his exit to be so sudden but his alcoholism had gotten too bad. But I can‚Äôt find a link that says it | I literally can‚Äôt go back to that show because of how they ended karev character | I think Karev was the final straw.  He was part of that core cast and him leaving deeply sunk the show. | Yes! And Karev‚Äôs exit seemed the laziest. | One day I was watching and realized I didn‚Äôt recognize anyone | I believe they call that the sunk cost fallacy, my dude.¬† | this show is still being made?????? | For the fact that there's practically no Grey left in Grey's Anatomy, I can't stand to watch it, but my wife insists we watch it together. I lost interest after Sloan died, then Shepard, and then finally Karev. Link feels like the only reason to keep watching, and barely so. | I just started it a couple months ago and I'm finally to the plane crash arc and I haven't been able to keep going because I know what's coming üòü the only bad thing about watching a majorly popular show years after it's release. | Shawshank redemption is synonymous with sunk cost fallacy? Did that movie feel like a drag to you or others in general? | All of this.¬† | I tried to do the same, but I just can't with all the political agenda that seems to have been a necessity for the writers to include in each episode. | My heart went from it after the plane crash. | Same. Plane crash was it for me. I watched a couple more episodes, but it was just too big to keep me interested. I wanted to see these people's day to say struggles. Not watch them process such a crazy and massive trauma. | The plane crash is what I always think about whenever I think of the show now though. There‚Äôs just no way that one single person (Meredith) could have all these traumatic events happen to them. It‚Äôs basically statically impossible. | Same. I haven‚Äôt rewatched a single episode either because those deaths pissed me off so much. | It started going downhill when George slept with Izzie | One of the worst things I've seen on TV, so lame | Lexie and Arizona? | So Derek stops on a road to help with a car crash. After paramedics arrive and help everyone he then goes to drive off. Drops his phone between the seats, stops to try and get it, and gets t-boned by a truck. He survives the crash but ends up at a different hospital than Grey Sloan where the doctor there doesn't get a scan of his head before surgery and he dies from a brain bleed. | You could tell every time they brought interns in it was just to make the next slaughter a little more gruesome. I remember watching it with my GF and guessing which interns would die in the next mass casualty event. | It's a sub about TV shows and the topic is Grey's anatomy, it's your own fault, sorry üòÖ | He only recently came out and said why they killed him off. He had a really bad drug addiction that wasn‚Äôt getting any better and causing issues with the show so they let him go. | I would say give it a chance. I've done many rewatches over the years. And I really like the seasons after Derek. Imo, it maintained its quality up until the covid season. I loved seeing the after-derek story told. Ellen did it justice. | He will always be Egg to me | I did stop watching after Glenn died, did I miss anything? | To be fair JDM does a amazing job in that series. | I love JDM. However, when Glenn died, so did my interest in the show. I seriously would have preferred any other character die. | I did. The way they handled it was‚Ä¶poor‚Ä¶ | I did stop watching it after Glenn died. Straw...camel. | That's irony, I quit the show because of that character.

<In before they come with ""but the comic books""> | I stopped after Glenn for sure. I was so... ugh. I remember that moment too. Disgusted lol | I stopped watching when Glenn died. | I ONLY kept watching to see Coral die. | Ironically JDM overstaying his welcome is a common complaint about the shows later years. I don‚Äôt mind it but the Negan redemption was too much for a lot of fans. | I felt there was enough strong characters to keep me interested.  This one didn‚Äôt bother me as much but it did change the tone of the show going forward. | I stopped watching because the show got too slow. Way too many filler scenes. Could fit the whole plot into like 4x less episodes. | Have you seen him in The Boys on Amazon Prime? | I stopped when they killed Carl because the actor went to college. | that show didn‚Äôt end under a dumpster? | Boy aren't we all big fans of his. That man is ridiculous and gorgeous. | I stopped watching because Glenn didnt die the first three times he should have. | It sucks. So bad | There was a good 20 minutes during his final episode where I thought TWD was going to get good again, but then the Whisperers were just people and not evolving walkers. 

I can't believe how much faith I put in those writers. What a waste. | I interpreted it as each son fulfilling a dream of Ragnar's as a means of him living on.

Ubba became the explorer and settler.

Hvitserk became the Christian

Ivar the raider died in battle.

Bjorn a legendary warrior and great leader of people. | Exactly! I was like ‚ÄúReally? *This* is what we‚Äôre going with?‚Äù | The whole thing with bjorns daughter was infuriating and then his girlfriend. Like they come back from battle and she's badly scarred to find out their baby died because the person they trusted to take care of her neglect her and she wandered into a river and drown. Bjorn and his girlfriend just kinda brush the death of their child and focus on the fact that his girlfriends face is fucked up now and despite him constantly reassuring her how much he loves her she fucking kills herself. Now his baby and his girlfriend are dead and he just kinda goes well the sucks. 

It was a while ago since I last watched the show and despite several rewatches, I don't make it much past ragnar dying because the plot becomes ridiculous. Also I might be misremembering some details because it has been about 2 years since my last watch. | Definitely should have ended with Ragnar but I would have accepted ending with Bjorn‚Äôs death | Yeah Ivar's miracle legs was a bit to much for me.  Like you don't need to make him a great fighter, make him a strategist and ruthless. It didn't even make sense when a guy sitting down could withstand sword blows like that, he's literally only using his arm strength against a 200lb dudes in armor wielding an axe using his full body on the swing. | Ivar‚Äôs death to me was the pinnacle of his arrogance. So convinced he was a god, he thought he was invincible, and then some newbie infantry lad stabs him to death. Some ‚Äúnobody‚Äù taking down a god. 

I throughly enjoyed it. | Wait, America? I thought Floki found Greenland. | It was *mildly inspired* by history. The writer drew some names from a hat and dreamt up some shit. | I much preferred The Last Kingdom, personally, but Vikings wasn‚Äôt bad. | There were some names in it that belonged to real people. No more than that. | There was a season where they had a mysterious stranger come to the village who performs some miracles, and then Floki fangirls to reveal it was actually the real Odin, and he was unambiguously performing real magic. | I preferred The Last Kingdom by a wide margin. I picked up Vikings in between TLK seasons and it was decently enjoyable at first and seemed well-cast. Even before it went downhill dramatically it never scratched the same historical itch that TLK did, despite both being very loosely historically based. I‚Äôm willing to accept that my dislike for Vikings is based partially on comparing it to my favourite show ever, but even without that bias I just didn‚Äôt think it was that good. | I thought Ivar was cool. | Seriously. This thread needs spoiler tags. I have it saved and was going to watch it for the first time but probably won't anymore. 1. Spoilers completely ruin a lot of the initial fun 2. Bad endings ruin good shows/movies. I didn't know the end to this show was terrible so maybe reading these responses saved me a lot of time. | You probably should have stayed away from this whole thread, my friend; every answer contains spoilers for a different show by the very nature of the question. | I think the show was still pretty solid up until the Professor was killed off. Once Maggie was added, it's like they took a hard turn into focusing on sex appeal, and the team was less cohesive and fun to watch. Then, of course, the addition of the Kromaggs pretty well derailed an interesting show about discovery into one where the new worlds often felt like a backdrop to something that was never very compelling. | What they did to write wade off was unforgivable | Both can be true. The show may have already started to go down hill but once Arturo left they hard pivoted and it got worse. | I wouldn't mind a Sliders reboot... There's been a number of dimension jumping and time jumping shows, and I've enjoyed them all. | Dark Matter has a similar vibe if you haven't seen it yet.¬†


But I do prefer Sliders.¬† | I'd love a limited 1-2 season reboot, maybe with the original actors in a couple episodes. The plot could be that Remy's plan to infect the kromaggs worked and everything worked out. The remaining Sliders somehow they get back to their earth, have kids (now late teens or 20somethings), and life is good....till one of the kids discovers the Timer in a hidden room in one of their houses and accidentally slides away, with the other kids following.

It would follow a very similar format to the original, except that it would be fully planned out in advance with the end written so they aren't just making it up as they went. | But he‚Äôs the best first officer in Starfleet! Or is he married to one? | Yeah, losing Nathan hit hard, but when the others left, it just wasn‚Äôt the same | I DO think Rudy was a decent replacement for Nathan (though I would have preferred to keep Nathan) but yeah I never really liked any of the other characters after the original set left. Such a shame -- it was SUCH a good show. | save me Barry... | Nathan was the best part of the show, but his replacement was honestly great.
It was when the others left that the show truly went to shit. | It was all him, as far as I recall.

He was a young actor, getting big, who just wanted to go do different things, from what I heard. | I think this is the saddest part because Joe Gilgun really gives great performances, the episode with the THIRD Rudy, omg‚Ä¶ | Have you seen Brassic? | He was completely carrying the show by the last season. He's a gem. | ""I don't even like cheese"" | I think Being Human actually did pretty well with the new cast. They weren't bad at all (well, I'll admit I never really liked the new ghost but Damien Molony and Michael Socha were great). | Joe Gilgun was genuinely good in Misfits. He did his best, and the show did carry on for a while.

There's a genuinely heartwrenching scene between his character, Rudy, and Curtis in Curtis' final episode.

But once everyone from the original cast was gone, it was not very good. The characters that they got in to replace Simon and Alisha were just really dull. | If you haven‚Äôt already watch This is England (the film) and This is England (mini series x 3 I think). I love Joe Gilgun in nearly everything he‚Äôs in but he‚Äôll always be Woody first to me. | British show about a bunch of young kids that got in trouble with the law and now have to do community service. There is a slight snag, as a freaky storm ends up giving people in the area a range of (sometimes ridiculous) powers, resulting in a load of shenanigans taking place. | Isn't that literally where the saying comes from? | Hit em with the Hein!! | He's probably out hanging out with Judy Winslow and Nebula Lawrence. | The theory was that Chuck comes out as gay so typical 1950s dad Howard disowned him and forbid him from being discussed by the family. | Community after Donald Glover left. | While wearing his leather jacket, no less. | Yeah. You fall in love with the characters the actors play, each of them seem perfect for their role. | cheech martin was in it too ! | Yup, Golden Palace was how they retooled the show after Bea Arthur left. Rose, Blanche, and Sophia bought a hotel and moved in there. Featuring Cheech Marin as the hotel chef and Don Cheadle, in his first starring role, as the young manager. | I was going to comment this, too. They all have their reasons here and there, but damn. 

I was real sad when Gideon left, and then when he died later on. The Morgan and Garcia relationship was so wholesome for me, and it was weird as hell not to have them in the same way... never he same. | when i tell you i bawled when he was saying goodbye to reid... | We stopped watching long before that. For us, it started with the very gruesome episode where they kill off Hotch's wife. It just seemed to get really dark after that, darker than all of the previous seasons, so we just stopped it altogether. | I never really found that relationship wholesome. Like he was aware that she was romantically interested in him and he played it up a little bit by calling her pet names and stuff, but he would never actually go for her because she is the ugly nerd and he's the hot badass. | I fully agree, The show suffered without Hotch but it was still fine. Morgan leaving fractured the whole vibe it was kind of impressive that a character I didn't even love had that effect. | I remember when he got the axe, a video of him drunk and high in a hot tub with a prostitute was circulating.  

Dude looks like an assault waiting to happen. | he has anger issues.

he got canned after he - according to available info - got into a physical altercation with one of the writers on set and kicked him, and this was not the first incident because he got in trouble for similar behavior before when he pushed an assistant director during an argument and was required to attend anger management classes. guess it didn't help. so he was let go, seeing as he was potentially a danger to other people. | I never forgave them for killing Gideon off in a later episode and letting an idiot be the one to do it. Gideon was smart as hell he wouldn‚Äôt have went out like that. The death wasn‚Äôt earned. 

The actor said he left due to believing it was going to focus a bit more on the victims than bad guys. He felt they kept trying to up how horrible the crimes were instead. Considering how wholesome he seems on TikTok I can see why the plots being that way would bother him. | I agree!!!! | Evolution is frikkin awesome- the baddy is so good- he has some of THE best lines in the show. It‚Äôs like a whole new show, plus they keep teasing about Reid coming back. | >gave up when they had Reid go to prison

same. i think i watched maybe one episode after that and decided i'm out. | He threw a massive tantrum and kicked someone on set. | He had anger problems, and there were multiple instances of him being physical with others on set (one which happened after mandatory anger management classes from the first). It‚Äôs super unfortunate, because his character brought so much to the show! That being said, I also don‚Äôt feel like that fact alone justifies keeping someone on who makes others feel unsafe at work. | i feel like i'm one of the very few people who didn't mind mandy leaving that much, i genuinely prefer rossi to gideon. | anger issues. he had an issue in 2013 (iirc) where he pushed an assistant director during an argument and was required to take anger management classes and then in 2016 he had an altercation with a writer-producer who he kicked so they kicked him out. | gibson got into two physical altercations with people on set and had to take mandatory anger management classes after the first incident. he was literally a tickin' time bomb. | That could be any country. Everyone thinks TWD outlived it's appeal. | I was super into it, but then I lost interest during that season after the prison.  Everyone was separated, doing their own thing, and I feel like nothing really happened. | I‚Äôm so glad they‚Äôre milking it for all it‚Äôs worth. I‚Äôve loved every one of the spinoffs so far, and I hope they keep them coming, so long as they keep writing vibrant characters. | Walking dead The Ones Who Live got great ratings and it brought me back in. Much different feel to that show. | I agree. The only way the end can work now is to replace Carl with Judith. They have strayed so far from the source material that it keeps everyone on their toes. Unfortunately I want to see the source material  come to life, not your interpretation( Scott gimple)!! | How does the comic end for someone that only watched the show? | For me the problem wasn‚Äôt that they killed Glenn or even how because as you say we knew or should have known. It was the jerking around the audience to make them wait to find out who it was. They wasted the entire previous episode with them driving around in the RV and nothing else happening. This insulting to the audience ‚Äúsuspense building‚Äù nonsense continued for and even got worse from there.

I stuck with it for a bit more until there was another season or mid season finale and they ended with a reveal that a major character was bitten. It was supposed to be a big deal, but I just didn‚Äôt care. I realized then the show wasn‚Äôt for me and it was time to stop. | what made the comic so iconic was that nobody was ever safe.   that feeling was incredible.  losing tyrese was mind blowing.

what i liked about the show was that it differed.  it was all fresh again.   it wasn‚Äôt that people weren‚Äôt surviving for me, it was the cliffhangers.

but now i neither read the comic or watch the show.   they ruined it for me. | I didnt make it through the negan arc. Iono why but it annoyed the shit out of me that everyone had infinite bullets and was a master marksman with little to no training, when in the comics they made a huge deal about training and how scarce the bullets were etc etc. Andrea was so important because she was the only sniper they had n all that | Did you know they made a movie? | CORAL! | Just a shock value death. Carl and Glenn were the show‚Äôs humanity. | When Carl died was where I drew the line and stopped watching too. Also the way he died made me so mad. To kill off one of the biggest characters in the show like that was just a big ‚ÄúF U‚Äù to the viewer and beyond disrespectful I get mad even writing this now. | That's when I stopped too | I was not yet at the parts where Glenn or Carl died and got spoiled about Glenn first and while I thought I was definitely going to hate that I also hoped maybe the show would still be good. So I continued watching for a couple more episode before someone else spoiled me about Carl and I just stopped. Never saw either of them die. | Yeah, that was a *terrible* decision on so many levels.  After that I was really just watching out of morbid curiosity. | That‚Äôs when you know the writers didn‚Äôt care anymore. The whole dramatic question of the show was can Rick keep Carl safe? Then Rick is gone so the question is can Carl survive without him? If the answer is no then there‚Äôs no show anymore. It has no reason for being. | This is the answer I scrolled down for! I kept up with it as long as I could, but the show REALLY went downhill after losing Carl. | I had to learn about that a while later and the fact I felt nothing told me the show was dead well before I ever watched it.


Common complaint, especially with the death of Glenn, it had simply become shock value. Classic case of trying to one up itself. | No. You think it will be because Jeffrey Dean Morgan but honestly once you get past The Governor some of the best characters are gone and the ones that remain have to deal with increasingly terrible writing. It becomes a real waste of some absolutely fantastic actors and what was a great series. | For me, the last 5-6 seasons is just a blur of large A-Team style assault rifle battles. | Till S6 its great. Afterwards they do have redeeming moments till s10. However the farm episodes were the best IMO | Yes season 5 and 6 are the best seasons just goes downhill for that | The show goes from a tense zombie show to a drama that happens to occasionally have zombies | It's super up and down, which isn't the worst thing ever (plenty of shows I love have rough patches) but TWD moves so slowly that the rough patches can last for most of a season. Even though some of the highs are really good, I just don't find it worth it. 

I did get most of the way through, but gave up part way through season 8. Without spoilers, season 7 set up a climactic action filled confrontation in season 8, but the first half or so of season 8 was super slow, low budget and poorly thought out action scenes with contrived bits added for drama. It was very boring and drawn out and I stopped watching. | I watched it through in pretty much real time over the years, I can remember maybe a handful of episodes after the farm, don't bother | I will always stand by season 5. The hospital was kinda eh but other than that it's a great watch. Season 6B is where it all went downhill. | Yes. It's one of those shows where a lot of people are too tethered to one or two characters and other people dislike one story arc and just leave. But if you like the show it's worth it. Is it as good as the end as at its peak, no, but that's almost Always the case. |  That's exactly where I stopped lol. It's a fantastic four-season show. XD I will rewatch for season 5 and 6 and then probably check out. | I tried finishing it last year. Originally, I got to season 6ish (whenever neegan shows up), but I could barely make it that far. Just got so repetitive and had way too much filler. You would get one exciting, quality episode followed by 2-3 boring ones.


I did watch the spin off Darryl Dixon show, and that was pretty good. But I've also had a crush on clemence posey since in bruges. It was interesting seeing how the apocalypse played out in france

The dead city spinoff was also pretty meh | Shit. I‚Äôm waaaay behind on that show but had no idea Glen dies. I don‚Äôt even want to watch anymore. | >viewers felt betrayed,

Only those who didn't read the comics, lol. | I think Glenn getting killed was so dramatic, a lot of people stopped watching after that. That‚Äôs when I stopped. I watched religiously up to that point. I watched some episodes after that but it was just not holding my attention anymore. | He is. But when the show keeps plodding along at a zombies pace despite the fact you've actually got a storyboard written down, if your audience isn't entertained, it doesn't matter if the entire cast is *perfect* might as well watch paint dry if that element is gone. It really felt like a ""saturday night live"" : it doesn't have to be *good* it just has to be *on*. | He's awesome in Marvel's 2 seasons of The Punisher.  Its on Disney+ now | Same. Shane was the central conflict of the show. It gets kind of silly after that with the prison/tanks/melodrama. | He got cleared of all charges. | It‚Äôs the chemistry between the three of them for sure. 

When they do specials and and just the trio it **feels** like it‚Äôs just a bunch of bros on a roadtrip with insane scenery. | He then went on to make a show about farming, arguably an even more difficult topic to turn into entertainment, and managed to make that a success as well | In spite of Clarkson being a capital P Prick. He is one of the most watchable television presenters I've ever seen and his banter and antics with May and Hammond make some of the funniest television I've ever watched.

In The Grand Tour in Bolivia when May throws a rock at Clarksons ""sports lorry"" I couldn't breathe from how hard I was laughing and I haven't seen anything close to similar with the new cast. | I hate this man and think he is an awful human being but you're correct about that. I once got free tickets to a taping of Top Gear and thought it would be fun. I assumed it was something on location since they filmed all over the world. Then I found out they were tickets to the new American version and noped the fuck out of there | He‚Äôs such an asshole but he‚Äôs just so funny | He and Mr. Wilman of course | That's so bizarre. I thought the whole point of that series was ""more of these three idiots doing what they were doing"". Was anybody watching it for a different reason? And I mean ""idiots"" in the most respectful way possible. | Seriously? | I‚Äôm not ready for the last episode. | Technically. | Doesn‚Äôt mean it was successful. I don‚Äôt know anyone in my circle who was a TG fan who watched post-departure. The magic was gone and the cars were never enough to sustain the show on their own. | Yeah, Matt LeBlanc was one of the hosts. I think he did all right, but the others weren't up to snuff.

Then they left and another group took over, including former Cricket star and TV presenter Freddie Flintoff... and the show was cancelled outright after he was horribly disfigured and brain-damaged in a horror crash. | In name only.


People didn't watch that shit for the cars. | Did it? | It only finished fairly recently lol. | It limped along on the laurels of The Trinity. | Don't forget Noel Edmonds ;) | I agree. Chris is excellent and the dynamics with the other two I felt worked well. | Lmao look at those down votes. Clarkson has some of the hardest cock riders. | I agree! I gotta say I‚Äôm pretty excited about the new Tony & Ziva spinoff. | Meh. The late teen seasons were meh, but the current cast is great. Helps that Gary Cole and Katrina Law very likable people and the characters don't have the baggage Gibbs and Ziva had. | Agreed.  I started tuning out when Cote left.  She and Michael had the best chemistry on any show at the time for me.  Those two made the show worth watching. | I didn't watch any more after Ziva left. I pivoted instead to Person of Interest, which debuted around the time that happened. | I'm not surprised that it survived losing DiNozzo.

I'm very surprised that it's still going without Gibbs.  He was the heart of the show. | It's because Cole and Law's characters were so well received. | Mark Harmon has left 2 years ago and it's actually the best change the show has had. Not only because Gary Cole (Gibbs' replacement) is amazing, but also because the whole Gibbs lonely and depressing story was going nowhere. I am actually impressed how stagnant his character managed to be after 20 years. Almost zero character development. So yeah Gibbs is gone and it's for the better.¬† | God I hope not. After what he did to Eliza Dushku he should be left out in the cold. If he is returning then I guess I'm done with NCIS. | I had some sympathy for alan in the early years but by the time ashton kutcher came around there was no redeeming qualities left in alan character. It was a shame what the shiw did to him | It's been years of reruns and I've yet to see any repeats of butcher's episodes.


Edit:  Kutcher.  Godamn autocorrect

Edit 2:  unintentional The Boys | I watched a video about this a while back and I always wondered why Lorre just didn't cancel it. By this point, he already had Big Bang Theory so I doubt he needed the money. | Four more? I was pretty sure there was one season with Ashton and that was enough to fold the show | Then he did Anger Management which was basically a continuation of it but his job changed and the family roles were filled by patients. It wasn't quite as successful but fills the same niche of background TV shows that are low effort watching and entertaining enough. | It was a hollowed out corpse before he left. I never understood the appeal. Cheap ass sex jokes at every turn. | I wrote it anxiously! | I get it.  This show doesn't hit all the right buttons for some who really aren't into raunchy Charlie Sheen comedy.  For me, it's one of the only few shows that actually gives me belly laughs at the end of a long day.  For all of Sheen's faults, I love most of his movies | Nah! Wasn‚Äôt trash. It was entertaining as hell. | Yes but it was watchable trash. | Very very highly rated trash | > Chuck Lorre‚Äôs a fuckin hack

This is such a dumb take though. Dude has *so many* extremely well received shows including some of the most popular sitcoms *of all time*. 

If you happen to not like them, that's cool. Not everyone likes everything. But pretending the guy doesn't know how to make shows that are highly entertaining to many millions of people (kind of the ultimate metric for being a good entertainer...) is being pretty obtuse. | I still can't figure out why Young Sheldon is so oddly _decent_ compared to his other stuff, tbh | > Chuck Lorre‚Äôs a fuckin hack

Are you calling the man who wrote the Teenage Mutant Ninjas Turtles theme song a hack? | Chuck's shows have a shelf life of about three years. Beyond that, they are like curdled milk on a Texas sidewalk. | 1) yes he is

2) the person you're responding to never praised him

3) it's completely reasonable to accept (1) and (2) while still recognizing the show failed without him

4) calm tf down | Tiger blood baby!!¬†



Who knew tiger blood meant AIDS? | Honestly, knowing that JFD was the director of the D&D movie and Game Night made me feel warm inside me because I loved Sweets and I'm so glad that his directing career is going well. | These television producers are incredibly shortsighted! | It came out years later that he actually didn't ask to be killed -- he wanted to come back. [It was the showrunner's decision to kill him.](https://www.thethings.com/why-john-francis-daley-left-bones-scandal/) | It was a mistake on their part. The show definitely wasn‚Äôt the same without him. And I was not a fan of the new guy they brought in. That‚Äôs pretty much where I stopped watching. | Yes, but they could have done it so he could come back.  I also hated when Zak left. | IIRC, he wasn‚Äôt originally supposed to be Gormagon‚Äôs apprentice. | I‚Äôm not sure how you couldn‚Äôt deduce that Bones is/has high-functioning autism and quite possibly savant syndrome. It‚Äôs why her interpersonal skills are so lacking. | The show would have fared much better if they actually marketed season 9 as a spinoff instead of insisting it's the same show. | Turkleton's wife not being in it hurt the show a lot too. | Season 9 was supposed to be the start of a new show, and idk why anyone insists otherwise, but it *was* advertised as such. I guess it was just too much for fans to overcome that it had the same name. | Everything was so perfect about what should have been the ending. | It only did for exactly one reason. Bill Lawrence was completely happy with the ending of the series, but ABC offered him a guaranteed 13 episode season with possible pickups for more, and he said he could not in good conscience turn down a guaranteed offer for his crew to have another year of work. He wanted to make it a new spinoff show, but that was one of the few contingencies, it had to be Scrubs. | I didn't even know there was a season 9... | Couldn't agree more. It was such an excellent ending.

The Book of Love became my wedding song mang years later. | It's on Disney Plus in the UK including the med school series, although the series is cut in places (for example the couple of examples of black face they used) | Ponceeeeeyyyy! | I think the marketing really let them down there. I watched season 2 when it came out, but then didn't even have the slightest awareness that season 3 had come out. | Got three episodes in to the 2nd season and every joke seemed to be about how ""woke everything is"".

Just seems like the show creators became bitter and everything that was brilliant about the original was lost to the writers wanting to inject political/social commentary at the expense of actual humor. | The only good thing about Andy Dick is Jon Lovitz punching him. | r/NominativeDeterminism | Ironic that a man named Dick is such a cockbite. | I don‚Äôt know if his death caused or coincided with the decline of The Simpsons but the shift was noticeable pretty much immediately. | I was going to say the same thing, I think his last episode was Bart The Mother which was one of the last episodes of classic Simpsons. Even Season 10 got pretty bad in the last third... | And Futurama the first time that show was killed off | Watching Pedro Pascel try to get through that script live was definitely a much needed light in covid darkness.¬† | Also sperm! | Those two things are related. Chevy Chase, from what memory serves, basically wanted more screen time and got Dan forced out. Then he got annoyed and basically stopped working which lead to his decreased appearance in Season 4. | The best part of Pierce's bequeathments was that we finally got to see closure on the promise of Britta getting a used Ipod nano.

[Proud owner, used Ipod nano, 2014](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fjf3g27i0rc951.jpg%3Fwidth%3D1080%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D09df42deb7fb36b9fac913df13f6ea7d469fc505) | I think they did the best they could with the hand they were dealt. I think S5 is incredibly underrated. Also has the peanut rap, the single best moment in the whole show | What a fucking hilarious way to write the season off. Perfectly meta show. | As someone who streamed the show after its run without being fully aware of all the show‚Äôs behind the scenes drama, I don‚Äôt think the ‚Äúgas leak‚Äù season is half as bad as some fans will tell you. | The year of the gas leak.¬† | I agree. Nothing will ever compare to the first 3 seasons, however one of my favorite episodes is Queer Studies and Advanced Waxing. Honestly, the main plots are great but i have a huge soft spot for the Abed and Elroy sub plot with the birds nest in the wifi. It's so perfect, \*sniff\*.

Also, without season 6 we would never have gotten Matthew Berry in Community! | And we got the greatest rap of all time in season 5 | Frankie and Elroy absolutely crushed it. Hickey I'm mostly neutral on, but he has some incredible moments, particularly the bulletin board hanging episode with Annie and his goblin interrogation in AD&D | lol no way her super mild character with like 15 lines across 2 episodes is better than Room or Short Term 12 | They refer to Season 4 as ‚Äúthe gas leak year‚Äù it‚Äôs mostly bad. But Season 5 was good - not as good as the first 3 seasons but still good - and then Season 6 really came together and was excellent. | You should give those final seasons a watch, especially 6 which I found very entertaining. The addition of Paget Brewster and Keith David were great and really brought some hilarious and memorable moments. | 5 and 6 are decent just not quite the level of before. | They're worth a watch, both 5 and 6 | You‚Äôre missing out. 5 and 6 have some great moments. 

‚ÄúStop saying Jesus wept.‚Äù | He's long since confirmed he's more than willing to do it and is planning to be in it whenever they're ready for him. | The two new characters in season 6 were great, I never see them given their due. | Hickey was way better than Pierce. I wish he'd stayed for season 6. Frankie was also great, and Elroy was aight. | Same. It was also just such a stupid, pointless death to me that I'm still mad about it. I know about some things that happened later but I just didn't want to actually sit and watch it. | Same and then he went full hunk and showed up in other things- was pleasantly surprised to see him in Abigail! | Same! He grew on me after the war, but let's face it lady Mary and her grandmother were the kings of the show, but once the heir and entail were solved, Matthew was just ...there... | I don‚Äôt think they killed her off, I think she wanted the fuck off the show. If I remember correctly they were not good to her. | I thought it was pretty promising at the beginning. It just got worse and worse as it went on.¬†


Just one of the many, many examples of a primetime network not knowing how to make anything other than a sitcom. | I survived another season without him then i quit, it's like watching big bang theory without Sheldon.. | Oh man, season 3 into 4 is just fantastic TV. You should try and find somewhere. | Literally right before the show took a major step in stride. You're missing out on some of the best episodes. Go find Scott's Tots RIGHT NOW. | That's okay, but Andy does deliver one of the greatest lines in the show- ""I *wish there*¬†was¬†*a way to know you*'*re*¬†in the¬†*good old days before you*'*ve actually left them*"" | They murdered that character lol | Everyone knows comedies end at the wedding¬† | But then when wouldn't have three amazing moments:

- When Jim and Pam find out she's pregnant (yes,  I'm an idiot and forgot this was end of previous season) so I'll replace it with:

 *Anything that Robert California says* 

- When Michael leaves

- The finale

They are worth sitting through the last two seasons. | All shows should end when the two major characters get married. It removes a big dynamic and every show falls into the trap of trying to write in a new romance. | Yeah, the Michael Scott Paper Company was the beginning of the end really. They ran out of ideas at that point | I agree. The Office had started circling the drain around the time Sabre came in. Steve Carrell leaving was just the straw that broke the camels back. | What a sad and pathetic take | I've never watched the office but I've seen so many clips by now. I was under the impression the wedding was the finale, it just makes sense. Sucks to know they tried to squeeze more out of it :\\ | I agree. The Robert California season was good. The show really went off the rails when Andy inexplicably became an asshole, and they started trying to introduce the ""next generation"" of characters. | I wish RC was a part of the show in earlier seasons cause for how good of an addition he was, him and Michael together would‚Äôve been even better. | Agreed. The Robert California season is better than the last two Michael Scott seasons. | Season 8 I thought was still really entertaining. Season 9 is trash | Debbie was so horrible, she really made the show hard to Watch for me | After that it's carried decently by the ian/mickey plot line, but Carl becomes mildly lame, and they completely screwed lip with wasting his genius level potential. Liam and granny became kinda cute though 

Although leading up to Gallavich wedding and Terry flipping out was pretty hilarious | >It's honestly crazy the show continues after she left.

In the OG British version she leaves after like season 1. US version was different in that Fiona stuck around. | I stopped watching after they had a season long arc where Fiona gains custody of the kids. The judge gives her a whole speech on how big of a responsibility it is and she just can't quit or walk away. Then a couple seasons later Fiona just leaves. | I think you forgot about Ian and Mickey | I would agree with this. This may or may not be a joke but tbh no more Casey meant a huuuuge exodus of sapphic fans. My gay ass loved me some Diane Neal | This is me. I love the first ten seasons. My favorite part was the chemistry between Benson and Stabler. The show floundered for a while after he left. I rewatch the first few seasons all the time but the later ones are overwhelmingly meh with a few gems here and there. | Police Brutality Zaddy was not a good character, he worked bc of the actor | Haha the de facto is defecto | The UnStabler | I'm glad someone else saw that.  I think the problem is that Mariska Hargitay started to have way too much pull over the direction of the show; it started to feel like an after school special.  The quality of the writing took a HORRIFIC nosedive.  The last couple seasons have just been unwatchable, IMO.  When Chris Meloni left things got bad, but Barba was awesome; IDK the actor's name, but he plays a terrific asshole and was genuinely fun to watch him throw barbs at everybody.  I know he's primarily a stage actor, but hope he gets another show soon.  

Now, it just feels like the show's budget is a quarter of what it used to be.  No more cameos (I rewatch Robin Williams' episode every couple years), crap writing, no budget, unmemorable actors.  I feel bad for Ice-T - him and Munch worked so well together.  RIP Munch. | Hate that. Wasn't a huge part of his character his relationship w his wife and kids?? | His comedic stuff is \*stellar\*. i remember him being in a nickelodeon movie (i think about a gym teacher?) but he was HILARIOUS in it | Data says viewership fell dramatically after | otherwise known as The Walking NYPD Training Video | I agree. When I watched those episodes, I kept thinking how Stabler would have absolutely come back for her during all of that. I know he was written off and not part of the show anymore, but the Lewis shit made me feel differently about the Benson/Stabler relationship they‚Äôd built together over many seasons. | I mean just because it‚Äôs the longest running doesn‚Äôt mean isn‚Äôt failing. Since Meloni left the shows numbers dropped and then continued dropping in terms of viewership. The episode he guest starred in many seasons later was the highest viewed episode of that season. 

For fans his departure was a nail in the coffin for them. It still pulls numbers enough to get renewed and with more rotating cast since nearly all the main cast have left, it‚Äôs potentially cheaper to make so still turns profits. 

The show definitely isn‚Äôt a failure like others listed here but there is no denying that Meloni leaving did cause a drop and that drop has continued ever since. | Not sure why you're taking this up the ass but I'm sorry I don't like your favorite show

Did you know ""unpopular opinion"" typically precedes an opinion that is unpopular

I think you'll live through this babe | Mum and I loved it and stuck with it a while longer, because it still had plenty of wonderful cast members and characters, but the through line just got kind of meandering and aimless after he was killed off. I do remember that they hadn't planned on that, Charles wanted to leave because he was about to become a dad and 24 episode seasons were too much. I get it, but damn :(


I've been a Josh Charles fan since the Sports Night days and I started watching it for him. Stayed because for five seasons or so, it was bloody good tv.¬† | Aw :(


It was one of the few shows mum and I both liked so it was a real bonding activity for us as well.¬† | Christine Baranski was always my favourite anyway¬† | Not even a whole season, too. IIRC, they wanted a cut of the merchandise, because it was their faces on the lunchboxes and everything, and the producers told them to piss off. | Yep. Bo and Luke became ""Coy and Vance"". I remember watching it but not for very long. | Derek‚Äôs death was the nail in the coffin for me. | > Frisky Dingo

Damn I wish we got a proper go at that X-tacles show. BOOSH! | Frisky dingo is one of the best shows ever made | A lot of people feel the quality of the show never recovered though. And although a Rimmer returned, it wasn't the same Rimmer. When I'm doing rewatches I always opt for seasons 1-6. | But the series actually did end after that. The animated series, the movies, and the specials were a different thing. | To be fair, the show is pretty different from the books even by the standards of most TV adaptations. They really did their own thing with it. | The further the show went from the books the better it got. Quentin's story was done but I personally found most of the other characters more interesting. | Yesh and it was the final season. | Yup. They made a very, very big thing on screen about how they wanted to focus on ""other perspectives"" than white males who get all the attention.

Which...fucking hell, is insensitive in this particular case. It was weird as fuck like they'd never even watched the show they'd made, or had literally no idea about other media.

Spoilers for anyone who didn't watch the show. >!Quintin was a depressed guy who struggled a lot with suicide idealization. Like real struggles of coming close to it. Then as the show went on he discovered he was bisexual, struggled with that, came to terms with it, had that timeline erased (so the one significant onscreen gay relationship never happened, despite lots of queer characters and lots of straight relationships). They had a whole episode on how common his perspective was in media, how it shouldn't be focused on and it was time for other stories. Then they had him kill himself, and a whole episode reflecting on how good it was that he killed himself.!< | Yeah, the last season feels a bit like an epilogue. The writers had a good idea the show might be cancelled, so they made sure the show ended at a good place (but still left some room to continue if they did get a renewal). So, it felt like Quentin and the main plot of the show wrapped up, but the final season gave us satisfying conclusions for everyone else. | That scene saved my life. Helped me cry out a lot of suicidal feelings. I didn't feel so alone. | Yes, my apologies I didn‚Äôt specify. I mean the US version | It's when they got too far ahead of Martin's writing. Due respect to the late season writers, but they just weren't in the same league as George RR Martin. | The idea that now Scully would be the believer, and her new partner the skeptic, was a decent one. But yeah the show was never gonna fire without the interplay between Mulder and Scully that everyone spent years loving. | so house could limp* | Gosh I must be the only nerd In the world that actually likes the show. | I love this opinion (and I really don‚Äôt like the show either) because the Big Bang Theory is the most successful sitcom of the last two decades and probably the last ‚Äúgreat‚Äù 10+ season single-cam sitcom to ever air on tv. It has two spinoffs, the first of which was wildly successful and the second definitely will be. The show is _not_ good to me but by literally every measure of success it‚Äôs the best show to have been on tv this century. | Every time I went to my ex's house, it was ALWAYS on the TV. Her parents watched that shit religiously, so naturally I would watch some of it. It had it's moments, but I never really laughed out loud. Her parents on the other hand thought it was hysterical lol. | I never watched it during its original run, just see reruns and I think it‚Äôs really funny. I honestly never fail to laugh during an episode. | I loved that episode where Sheldon, Leonard, Penny and Amy are on a game night. There is a moment where I always fail to not laugh. | When I was in the hospital for two months, they only had this show on DVD, along with a bunch of older lame movies... so I ended up watching most of the show while I was there. 

It's a decent show, lol | I'm with you.  I lived overseas when the show started and I would watch shows simply because they were in English, and BBT was one of them even though I didn't find it all that funny.   But hey, Kaley Cuoco is cute, so why not?   But after a season or two it became obvious to me that 1. it was REALLY unfunny. and 2. These are not eccentric nerds, they're just dicks.   

And from then on I figured out the formula:

Nerd 1.  ""But this is just like when Doctor Octopus did that thing.""

Nerd 2. ""No, it's more like when Niels Bohr did that other thing.""

Nerd 3. ""Girls are scary.""  

Girl. ""I don't get it.""

Nerd 4. ""Bazinga""

Audience. ""OMG, I know about Doctor Octopus, Niels Bohr! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!""  



Ugh, the worst...until I saw Two Broke Girls... | i thought that show was about nerds and i genuinely gave it a try and wanted to like it. but the jokes were corny and dry and it just became ""jew/indian bash hour"" | My buddy called it black face for nerds. | It's a minstrel show, except instead of being racist, the joke is a bad parody of neurodivergent people. Just like a minstrel show, the humor comes from wanting to see yourself as ""normal,"" and having that normalness validated by seeing an amped-up caricature of an ""other,"" which causes a feeling of catharsis. I've only seen a couple episodes, but from what I've heard, they don't even stop at making fun of ""nerds"" and go full-tilt into mocking other ""weird"" groups based on their identity.

It's a kind of humor I find incredibly obnoxious too, and I think it's enormous success says some unfortunate things about humanity. | Bazinga‚Ä¶ | IT IS FUNNY. YOU KNOW IT IS FUNNY B/C YOU HEAR AUDIENCE PEOPLE LAUGHING. WOULD THEY HAVE FAKE PEOPLE FAKE LAUGHING? I THINK NOT! FUNNY!!! | It's enjoyable, generic entertainment. Not all TV has to be the best thing in the world, and given that they have fairly accurate scientific stuff in the scripts, it's pretty ok. 

Also, there is a degree to which that show perfectly encapsulates several aspects of academia and physicsits in general. Yes, the older ones aren't all like that, but god the young ones can be those exact fucking characters to an unbelievably level. Especially the disrespect towards engineers, that's so fucking real it's not even funny. | My mom really liked it and I couldn‚Äôt stand any of it.  Then again I can‚Äôt stand any show with a laugh track. | First two seasons weren't bad. | the laugh tracks were funny. | I think season one was a show for nerds with some really authentic references like the OG time machine. Then it just leaned into making fun of nerds. | THANK YOU | Sheldon Cooper is when Calliou grew up. | They did 12 seasons of it, at some point you do have to move on.

I also remember him talking about how he realised how old he was getting, and in particular how close he was to the age his dad was when he passed. That made him realise that there was more roles he wanted to explore, and not just be doing Sheldon for several more years. | The second season of Young Sheldon onwards is great - not that season one is bad though. The show improved for me once it became about the whole family and not just Shelly. | Yeah I was expecting to loath Young Sheldon, instead we got a show that had humor and serious situations. The episode the father died still haunts me. It felt so realistic.¬† | GANNICUSSSS | I still think they should‚Äôve just had 20 different actors play Spartacus. A new one each episode. All in service to the inevitable ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Spartacus!‚Äù bit. /s | Andy was still alive during the prequel season.  The hope was it would give him time for treatment. | During that period? I *still* routinely think about how we were robbed. It really felt like he was going¬† to be around in *something* forever | R.I.P. Phil Hartman | I just started a rewatch of The Simpsons and every time I hear him, it‚Äôs a punch to the gut. | Jon Lovitz agrees | I think he's given too much credit for it.  I say ""Fuck the abusive drug addict wife.""  He's not responsible for her blasting him, she did that herself and if all it took was Andy Dick to give her some cocaine then she would have gotten it herself at some point. | Now c'mon, Andy Dick is a horrible person, but as ""Matthew,"" he was funny AF!  

As far as I'm concerned, Andy Dick died after the show ended and never did anything else. | It‚Äôs been so long I actually forgot that I used to like Joe Rogan. Loved him on this show then‚Ä¶ | He wasn't unfunny but definitely not near the funniest on that show imo. | I liked Homeland better after. But Quinn. I loved Quinn. | Man, bringing back some memories. 'They bashed Bea!' | My Dad had the entire thing recorded on VHS tapes. We watched them all as a kid. I remember the themed Pot Noodle adverts they had. I absolutely loved it but I was definitely too young to be watching it. I got in trouble in school talking about it (I think it was the storyline where they had a hostage situation in the prison and the current ""leader"" got shot in the head). | But damn, The Freak was such an amazing villain! | I remember watching an interview with Bea after the episode. Apparently, The Freak also wanted to leave, but the directors dissuaded her, saying there was no way the show could survive losing such pivotal characters at the same time. (For the life of me, I can't remember the actors' names right now) | When they fought the walls moved like cardboard for a reason. Used to love watching it with my Ma, Haven't watched Wentworth but it's fucking ruined now anyway. | She deserved little quiet and peace at least one season before killing her .. it just went on full speed | I didn't know there were golf tournaments in women's prison. | Rob Morrow/Joel Fleischmann left because he couldn't negotiate a better salary iirc. It's all available to watch on Amazon now. | Amazon Prime | It's on Amazon Prime Video in the USA.  

I also love the show and have the DVD box set because someone gave it to me as a gift.

It's still a good show but I recently started a rewatch (to check if it's ok to watch with my kids) and unfortunately there are some things that didn't age well. But, there are also some places where they were ahead of their time. | It‚Äôs on Prime in the US. DVD sets are also still available as I bought one about 9 months ago. | The writers‚Äô strike and the sudden shift to half-seasons was where a lot of shows took a downward turn. 20+ episodes gave the story time to breath, explore the wider world and characters. Now, it‚Äôs a 10 episode sprint to the finish line | I definitely agree with you. I didn‚Äôt mean to imply it got bad because she left. That‚Äôs just when I noticed the quality went way down. It would‚Äôve been so much better if Trinity had lived for at least one more season. | I‚Äôll stand by how good the Edward James olmos and Colin hanks season is though. I enjoyed all the other seasons but not to the brilliance levels of everything trinity and prior of course. | YUP! My wife and I just watched this show from start to finish over the last few months. I was stunned they threw Doakes away THAT quickly. That's a ""final boss"" type rival to Dexter. I know in some ways Doakes got Dexter outed with Laguerta but he should have been the one to ""bring Dexter down.""

John Lithgow also acted his ass off and made it hard to live up to that after. I thought Colin Hanks did a solid job though too. | Don't tell me that I'm watching it now towards the end of Trinity, and I feel like it's in decline now... | Indeed. | I just kept expecting Ben Browder and Claudia Black to get together like John and Aeryn. | > I'm one of the few that loved SG:U. Loved it. Watched it with a girlfriend at the time, and at the end of season 2, she asked, ""when is the next one season?"". Her face when I told her that it was cancelled was the same face someone makes witnessing a puppy being kicked.

This is why I've never rewatched it.  No reason to get invested for a canceled show but I remember enjoying it. | My man. SGU was amazing. I was so bummed when it got canceled. 

Same thing with Terminator: The Sarah Conner Chronicles. Why do all the good shows get canceled? üò° | She was the main writer and director (or producer.) she had a heavy influence on the show when she was on it during season one. I believe it was after season 1 she left and they got new writers. The show was still alright, but I feel like her influence was really important and very needed throughout the seasons | I almost agreed with her. Then I realized the older sister was really irrelevant to most of the humor. Mandy was the funniest by the time she left. Eve was also funny as hell but wound down afterward. Meanwhile the rest of the cast minus Leno were great through and through. | I know :( | Yeah that's the thing, while they changed some things for the show, the books killed off a lot of people. I think it was supposed to drive home, the brutality of the events unfolding around them. No one was safe and nothing was certain. 

But I remember the first season being incredible. It was still in the water cooler era of TV where shows came out weekly and everyone was excited to discuss it at work the next day ""around the water cooler."" With my roommates and friends at the time, we were so pumped to watch each new episode. We'd hoot and holler like a football game was starting.. Somewhere between the 2nd and 3rd season, the show just lost its appeal. | I was into the graphic novels before the show was made. It wasn't his death that made me stop watching. It was the disgusting way the showrunners handled it and treated the audience like shit. I knew it was coming and I wasn't going to stop watching the show. But the way they handled it? Yeah I was done. | Which shows that they changed things from the comics when it suited them. | There was really no one charismatic enough to fill the whole left by his absence | The world was a park genius | If I recall, it was her decision to leave for ‚Äòbigger projects‚Äô. But it ruined the show! | Teenaged me was heartbroken. No surprise, the same people tanked the ending of Gossip Girl. | I thought she left to pursue her career which went nowhere | Thank you for the very useful information regarding Welcome Back, Kotter. It answers a lot of questions. I feel bad they did not follow Gabe Kaplan's idea though, it would have let the cast grow and expand a bit more. | Yeah Mr Turner was such a fave I‚Äôve been waiting on something scandalous to drop, even after all these years, as to *why* his story line was abandoned out of the blue but it really seems like the network truly just wanted to go in a different direction and just said byyyeeee. Soooo dumb on their part. 

And yeah, the Cory/Topanga marriage plot was such a bad message to kids üò© giving up Yale for a high school sweetheart and then framing the parents who rightfully lectured them as the villains. | It was not because of dissatisfaction of the show, but more to do with exhaustion and the fact he had drug and alcohol problems. As far as season 10 ending, it was around season 8 they were starting to plan the show to end and Joey's spin-off series, the cast was always getting tired of their roles and felt they could expand more in other creative outlets professionally. That was all. | Paget Brewster calling the Dean stupid in the Honda episode and Keith David encouraging white people in the incest wedding episode are enough to validate the existence of season 6.

Honestly, I had fun with the season outside of those episodes too. It was surprisingly solid and held up on a rewatch. | Paget Brewster is one of my unsung heroes in terms of getting me to check out a show. Ever since [Andy Richter Controls The Universe](https://youtu.be/zq9nu-yQer0?si=XgzsEu1XRpz5KmXE) | Chevy may be an ass, but he sure is funny. | Yea I didn't actually have a problem with Annie but I just hated Fiona left, show got less weird and more monster of the week, there was a vague overarching story about Fiona's father that was dropped. | I'll be honest. The show started sucking after season 2. It could have been great, but the story from season 3 onward literally goes nowhere. | He hasn‚Äôt left (yet)‚Ä¶. due to a dispute he won‚Äôt be signing on for a sixth season.
The  fifth season has been split into 2 halves - the first aired early 2022 and the second is slated to air late 2024.
Because of his leaving; apparently, there won‚Äôt be a sixth season. 
So, whether he‚Äôs killed off or not remains to be seen. | His name is Taylor Sheridan.  He wrote the very good movie Hell or High Water (and got an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay).  He also wrote Sicario, and wrote and directed Wind River.

They're a bit formulaic, but he is the writer on both TV series Mayor of Kingstown and Tulsa King.

He's a talented guy, but as a fan of the show, I can admit the Yellowstone plotlines border on the ridiculous at times.  But it's TV, even the most highly regarded series contain somewhat unrealistic plotlines.

Part of his problem is he's a one man writer's room, so there's no one to push back when he goes off the rails a bit.  And he's done so many projects, it's easy to get ""Taylor Sheridan fatigue."" | I agree. Very nice to watch a series end and be happy.

I liked Natalie too, but my kids always missed Sharona. I just liked how Sharona called him Adrian instead of Mr Monk. | I liked them both, although I prefer Natalie. I feel like Monk made his biggest emotional growth with her. She had a lot of patience and always tried to support him like a friend (although he took advantage sometimes like in that episode about the square tomatoes lol)¬†


Sharona pushed him out of his limitations which was good but it felt like he did it out of obligation because he didn't have any choice and she knew how to say no. Btw I loved that Sharona ended up with Randy it was a perfect ending.¬† | That was absolutely the intention. If they wanted to continue with a Hinson impersonator, they would have done that similar to the Rick & Morty recasting. They opted to end the series and go out with some sort of bang. | Not going to say I was a big fan of Unknown Hinson(although thought at least one of his albums was pretty funny) as I didn't know much of him, but wow was the show terrible after they got rid of him. I have to agree that it seemed like it was meant to be an FU and I think that was part of what made it so terrible. | They canceled it after Rosanne went nuts I thought? | He was fired from the show, Tracy Morgan replaced him. | The show was already terrible, most people watched it just beacuse of Cavill | I mean, it's not like the show doesn't already have a track record. | If it's good, people will watch. I am sure Mindhunters would be the top watched show if season 3 came out. The problem with the new streaming is the uncertainty and not getting conclusions. I feel more shows on these platforms need to end their seasons with the idea that they won't be back so the audience can get closure. | ‚òπÔ∏è
I think they thought Allison janney  could carry the show.   She's fantastic.  But it was the back and forth between her and Anna Faris that was the magic.  
I think losing Violet may have been a problem too. The three generations all bickering and blaming the other was part of the dysfunction that goes along with an alcoholic household.  
   (By the way, If you appreciate Allison, janney, there's a movie streaming called ""Lou"" on Netflix.  She really brings it) | Oh I agree. The plot also reeked compared to Season 1 - but I think Kinnaman returning would‚Äôve helped it feel like it somewhat retained the same flavor/show. Just one less thing that was very different, ya know? | Agreed. The show doesn‚Äôt know what it wants to be. I‚Äôd say it went from trendsetting to following trends. | I think they lost the magic around that time. They coasted for a bit on Capaldi‚Äôs time as the doctor but it did lose steam. I view Jodie Whitaker as the Hail Mary attempt to make it ‚Äúcool‚Äù again and now it‚Äôs just over. | Didn‚Äôt Sean William Scott join ? | Sorry?!?! | Oops, wrong comment, sorry will delete | Don Knots did save the show. | I agree she was annoying, I hated the character. But the last season without her was way worse than the others. | We just did a re watch and now I‚Äôm like can we do a rewatch without the main arc? The government aliens millennium plot just has too many holes and is too over blown for me. Monster of the week eps only please. | Yeah, the standalone episodes are generally much better to me than the mytharc ones.

I've always wanted an episode that was just Mulder and Scully renting a car/driving to the airport/flying on the plane/checking into the motel for the first twenty minutes, then a hard smash cut to them harrowed and tense in the rental car on the way back and trying to comfort themselves and each other for the last twenty minutes.

Never actually see the investigation or the monster, just have to infer what happened from context.  They're the only two characters who speak. | Home? Is that the one with the mom who lives under the bed? | ""Squeeze"" is the one that stands out for me. My husband had never seen the early episodes and last year we got X Files on some streaming service or other. I was so excited to show him those, especially that one. I got maybe 10 minutes into the episode and had to turn it off, I had forgotten just *how* scared I had been. 

Excellent TV! | 80% of episodes require no prior knowledge whatsoever, yet overall they all add to the chemistry which kinda feeds into the wider arc.

So clever, I've done a run through before and not watched a single mythology episode, then about 5 years later I did the opposite :) | I was completely with you until you said your favourite episode is Home! It's the only one I skip on a rewatch, can't handle it. | Home is my favorite episode too | Is that the one with the inbred family in Pennsylvania? The one that starts with a birth that goes wrong? | Home is the scariest thing I've ever seen on tv.¬† Whenever it happens to come up in conversation, spouse and I both do an involuntary shiver.¬† | I'll turn 37 this year and I remember when I was kid, being terrified when the trailer for the episode Home would air on FOX. Home is still a hard watch for me, and one of the reasons is because of how that episode makes me feel. The look of the family makes me feel so grotesque when I look at them, the inside condition of the house is disgusting, the marks on the floor from the scratching of the wheels by the mom, the sound the mom screaming under the bed, ack I hate it lmao. My god that shit is traumatizing on that alone and that isn't even all it contains. | That episode lives rent free in my head with how creepy it is. It's the only episode I actually think about, ever.¬† | So from watching like...I dunno 6 or 7 seasons? I stopped watching and never picked it back up. 

- Aliens are real but there's two species? I think? The Russian alien assassin was an alien, and there were others, maybe.

- Did Mulder's sister ever get found? | I was just thinking about that episode yesterday because it's the first thing I think of when anybody mentions the show. Worst part is that I don't think they can air that episode on regular tv anymore.  Still one of the most impactful hours of a show I've ever seen and obviously unforgettable | It's drama Seinfeld | I used to do social work in Home, PA. My favorite place to go was the property we lovingly referred to as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre House."" This was sort of a misnomer, the vibe was definitely more Hills Have Eyes. | Yeah, at the time it was still pretty novel, but they were really making it all up as they went. If they‚Äôd made the show today, it would be 100% serialized and plotted from end to end. Definitely holds up better as an anthology series. | That's more ot less how I'm watching The Conners/Roseanne¬† (very different theme, i know). I didn't even realize it was the same show/cast until well into season 4/5 or so.
I never watched Roseanne,¬† so her not being in the show had 0 effect on me, but i saw people in here complaining. | She's the better actor, and her character's motivations were more complex - Duchovny's character was so impulsive and myopic that he would have either died, got fired, or been thrown in prison dozens of times without Scully to rein him in. | One of these days Im going to watch X-Files again. | Comedian Anthony Jeselnek once said the following at Charlie Sheen‚Äôs Roast:

‚ÄúThe only reason that you even have a career is because God hates Michael J Fox‚Äù | I remembered the show but completely forgot that Charlie Sheen was the replacement, I remember giving it a try and giving up after an episode or two | He‚Äôs better than you, and you know it. | ""Men"" | Should have gone with Martin Sheen instead. | Back to back on UPN (now the CW) in the early 2000s around 3-5 or 6-8 i forget (simpsons were on 5-6 daily.) | Wow I did not know that. I also thought that was just his signature stance. He has a hand in his pocket in practically every scene he's in on Family Ties. | I forgot david spade showed up in 8SR!

My dad's favorite show growing up was Three's Company and he genuinely couldn't bring himself to continue the show after John Ritter passed. Don't blame him, the guy WAS the show | I've actually watched that half more than the first half. I just liked the dynamic. Grieving widow, her Dad, and deadbeat cousin, moving in. | You really can't go wrong with James Garner | I agree, I think the whole show was great! | David Spade ruins everything he's in. | sorry you had to find out like this | I think it came across so genuine because it was genuine. | They couldn‚Äôt have ‚Äúignored‚Äù it; obviously there had to be some reason in-show the character would no longer be appearing. What they‚Äôre saying is that rather than come up with a more flippant explanation as to why he wasn‚Äôt there and then not talking about it, they chose to directly incorporate the character‚Äôs death into the main plot. | It was likely more to do with contracts already being signed with tons of actors and production companies - you cancel the season they all still get paid. 

Even when the dropped Spacey they would still have had to pay out his contract, unless ""get accused of bad things in the media and we can fire you"" clauses have become a thing in Hollywood (and they may well have done).

Might as well finish the season and try and make SOMETHING out of it. | it makes sense even it's not true ... that the show runner might give it a shot, execs hate to give up on a profitable show, even more so one a big a draw as house of cards... it wouldn't surprise that even a shot at 1 more season without him would have been pushed out the door anyway regardless of contacts etc, hell I've never looked into but his salary was likely the largest single expense for the show, so it would seem like a no-lose situation to the beancounters... grind out 1 more season for cheap, get some eyeballs for sure, maybe it flops oh well prob still paid for itself, and maybe the team is able to keep the magic and it's years of more money! | 100% this. HoC was a palace intrigue show about people in the shadows pulling the strings. Once he actually became POTUS, it turned into an underwhelming version of the West Wing with murder and sex subplots. | House of Cards were 13 episode seasons. They should have ended after season four and finished with 52 episodes. | Exactly! Should have been 4 seasons of 13 episodes each. | Really just needed one final season where everything falls apart after the ending of the second season. | What newer series? I tried googling and couldn't find anything. | The original run ends with Urquhart being assassinated. But it was a more concise, season 1 rise, season 2 rule, season 3 fall. Which follows the books it's based on. | Honestly, as much and it couldn't have happened, just having Spacey play this character being dragged down by past sexual assaults and crimes would have been the only 'satisfying' ending to the show...  but we just got to watch in the tabloids not on netflix | That would have been an amazing way to end. Imagining if it caught up to him... or not. | Did anyone even like her prior?

She was just an annoyance the whole way through. I legitimately think the only enjoyable Claire moments happen in the first 5 episodes of the show when they plot together. | Court of public opinion already convicted him. | lol | with that stance anyone with money is irredeemable

I mean you can‚Äôt hope to have access to better information than the jury that cleared him got.

If you don‚Äôt trust them, how could someone innocent clear their name? | It is never a problem that someone has too many resources for court. It's a fact-finding venue; 'oh no, he collected too many facts' is a non-issue. The problem is only ever that too few resources are apportioned for many. | Basically, yes. I really hope there is a Spacey come back. | Very true, but House of Cards had clunky product placement in it from the beginning. I remember a scene with Frank Underwood and Peter Russo from season one, when Peter‚Äôs son pulls out a brand spankin new PS Vita:

FRANK: Is that the SONY PLAYSTATION VITA‚Ñ¢Ô∏è?

PETER: It sure is.

FRANK: What games does he have?

PETER: All of ‚Äòem üòè | Yeah there's somehow a blind spot in the White House lmao | There was at least one episode in the last season, maybe more than one, where I got the distinct impression that Donna got Eric's lines. She was just acting so much like him. | Exactly. Eric WAS the show. It‚Äôs crazy to think to just move on without him like that. | Whenever I rewatch the series, I don't watch the last season since it just doesn't feel the same.  I love that show otherwise | #FUCK RANDY | That anchor being thing is so meta. | I didn‚Äôt help that they never shut up about him. | For anything confused about ""Hide is black now""

He discovered his biological father is black, thus he is half black. | I mean Donna hooking up with some dude is probably partially because the failed and dropped idea that Eric was going to be a totally different person when he came back from Africa. The dude she was hooking up with was supposed to be Eric basically, but  that idea failed terribly and they dropped it. It just came across as they didn't change the stories. | I think the peak of ""why the hell is this happening *here*?"" was Hyde's wife's first husband barging into the basement like it was some public restaurant. | > Jackie and Fez got together

probably the most unbelievable part | They tried to force the status quo with him, when they should have been writing the show's denouement through the final season. | Sounds just like my opinion of Scrubs... and GoT. | Yes, it started declining in season 5, but blonde Donna was the end for me. | She was yelling at Foreman a lot. Unbearably so | They ran out of ideas and started recycling things as well. From my understanding it‚Äôs one of the reasons Topher left and Kutcher was pulling away as well. We don‚Äôt see a lot of Kelso either that last season.
Breaking up Hyde and Jackie was lazy writing. No one at that point wanted her and Fez together. Reminds me of the HIMYM people being obsessed with Ted & Robin, but the audience had moved on. | ...honestly, you're right. Come to think of it, the episode where Leo turns out to have a Purple Heart was also kinda funny. Or the one where Hyde quits smoking. Or the one where Kelso gets a job at a stripclub (still can't believe I didn't recognize Bruce Willis until I read about it).

It's weird - looking back at the episodes, there *are* some funny moments that stand out. But on the whole, the entire 8th season just kinda... stinks. Maybe it's the weird direction the romance subplots kept taking. | Was supposed to be the joke :( | Pretty sure I already heard it was completely scrapped and that the Hemsworth wouldn't get his chance as Geralt? | Same | Yup. Tax write-off incoming! | Lol, no.... they have so much more material to get through and now are almost certainly going to either rush the crap out of it to try and get it all done in a satisfying way. Or they will bungle it and add more random stuff into the story, changing character motivations as to be unrecognizable.

Sorry just a little fucking annoyed still how they had a show with that much potential in the first season and then did the Rings of Power thing where it feels like they hired people to just write fan fiction in a universe that has established lore and characters and motivations. 

For example, if you are going to tell your own stories in these spaces, you need to have a really solid handle on these characters, or you are just calling someone Yennifer or Geralt in name but the character they are isn't there it's just soulless. | I'm not convinced they will stick to the original series plotline. IIRC HC quit because the show's producer didn't like the original story and wanted to do something else. | It was a bit jarring, but it actually grew on me as a thing. Setting up characters and backstories as it went. Wouldn't have worked for every season, but with a show based on something with a lot of lore and time and stuff, it kinda worked. | I have read the books which helped, and honestly given the way the short stories are presented I struggle to think of a better way for them to have done it.¬†


It definitely comes off as disjointed but I can see how they tried to organize things to reveal the timeline while bouncing between different short stories.¬† | The times jumps in the first season is actually one of the few book accurate things they did. The first book is less of a novel and more of a collection of short stories that aren‚Äôt really chronological. The books after that become more of a traditional narrative | It's insane how badly they butchered it | The beginning of season 1 was were it fell apart. | The Witcher has ended up with a nasty combination of some subpar performances combined with a mostly uninspired script that has changed too much from the books to really follow where they were successful. To make matters worse it lost the last bit of audience excitement by loosing really the only beloved aspect the show had left. | Rule 3 = Rings of Power | Same thing with Rings of Power. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è | Are you saying it was all female writers, directors, and producers? | The game series picked up after the books so they had a little more freedom to explore the narrative-- they were working with the world, characters and using the books as backstory, but weren't directly adapting the novels. So they had a little more flexibility. The Netflix series is adapting the novels, so they have more constraints. | Oh that's a pretty good pick... But it's no Henry. | Should have just killed him off, honestly | I stopped Grey's just purely out of protest of Karev. It was the most messed up move ever to leave Jo right after helping her work out her issues. Like 'i helped to fix you so I could break you again'. Luca's arc almost had me leaving before that though, with the baby in a bag and Luca losing it, and his sister joining the Station 19 show. | Those poor rubber ducks. | Wow really?? üò´üò´ | I loved This Life, it hit as I was in my 20s and just moved to London | You were spared.

MAH NAME

IS

ALPHA  üôÑ | Same here, the dumpster fakeout and then leaving who died as a cliffhanger between seasons killed my interest in the show | TWD had a slow death.  There were ups and downs after Glenn‚Äôs death, but frankly imo the show was dying before then.   

Personally I enjoyed season 9 when Angela took the Showrunner responsibilities.  It breathed a lot of fresh air into the show and characters.  In particular Judith and Michonne‚Äôs relationship is developed a lot which was really great.  The actress who plays Judith is going to be a star.  But it was also the season that Rick and Maggie leaves.   The Rick and Michonne stand alone series was not good at all, and for me was the last nail in the coffin for any spin-offs.  I just don‚Äôt care about these characters any more. | Not really tbh | So did I.  Because it showed what utter contemp the show runners had for their audience. | I remember someone giving a summary of what happened and my jaw dropping because of how bad it was. I stopped shortly before/after (i cant remember) that town with the walls and was upset that i lasted as long as i did | Nope | He‚Äôs amazing in everythign | Some characters you just don't kill, because you'll lose the whole audience. And Glenn's death was not only shocking, but extremely sadistic, drawn out, completely random, and was a giant cliffhanger. | It was true to the comics. Steven Yuen has said in a couple interviews that he was honored to get the scene. 

They changed some things plot wise when they adapted the comics into a show, but that scene in particular was pretty true to the original story. And well executed, if I do say so myself. The next arc was my least favorite, but the last season was really good IMHO. They went out on a high note, even without Rick. | Me too. I feel like the show lost a huge chunk of viewers | Correct, his art should‚Äôve ended with him having his throat slit by Rick in that fight. The end, he‚Äôs such an entertaining character as evil Negan, but him trying to be good and changes. His whole arc is so hard to follow. | I just started the boys yesterday lol | Hang on for a wild ride with The Boys. 

I stopped counting the number of holy-crap moments

JDM doesn‚Äôt show up for a while but it‚Äôs a great show.  Enjoy! | I thought it was OK. At least had a definitive ending for characters. | It has a 7.9 on imdb either 33k votes. A far cry from ""sucking so bad."" | The Whispers were from the source material, not something new the show came up with. | I remember in one scene, they had walkers that could climb and open doors. But then, they just never mentioned it again. Much like many of the story lines from Lost.

Still watched both those series to the bitter end though. | Yes! I always felt that each of his sons‚Äô storylines carried an aspect of Ragnars‚Äô personality and character. | And Sigurd was forgotten. | And Sigurd was killed by brother, which is kind of a nightmare given Ragnars propensity for being betrayed by Rollo | I love this!! | It was greenland | Greenland is part of North America | Why they went with the absolute worst character to then lead the show tho after they couldnt hang onto ragnar any longer ill never know. They had so many options. | If you have the time, read the books by Bernard Cornwell. The tv show was great but the books were fantastic. | I recommend that you also check out Black Sails. Excellent pirate show that is full of action, great characters and high production values. And they also feature fictionalized-version of real historical-pirate like Charles Vane, Jack Rackham, Anne Bonny and BlackBeard.

Season 1 can be rough to get through cause there are moments in the first season that were not good. But once you actually try to get to the end of season 1, the show becomes excellent forward | One thing I found a bit irritating about the later seasons of The Last Kingdom was that like 30-40ish years passed from when we see adult Uhtred first to the last season there is no attempt made to have any of the adult actors change in appearance. They should have done what the crown did and recast, or at least, idk. , give them some grey hairs make up wrinkles. It kinda got hard to suspend disbelief for me at some point. | I think sometimes people just like whichever of the two shows they watched first ‚Äî aka a massive fan of Vikings is let down by TLK and vice versa.  

I did watch The Last Kingdom first and not sure if that colored my opinion, but I love it more by a large margin as well.  Just the sheer wealth of amazing characters alone make TLK better, let alone the pacing and story being so much better overall.  It‚Äôs in my top five shows of all time though so I‚Äôm biased! 

Personally I lost interest in Vikings after Aethelstan was lost so long before losing Ragnar like most folks say was the end for them.  It was just okay for me though all the way through the three seasons I watched. | TLK is incredible and Eliza Butterworth as Aelswith is one of my favourite TV performances of all time. She‚Äôs absolutely magnificent! | How you could possibly watch them at the same time is crazy to me. Seems like you could easily get confused. 

Perhaps that just means that I am easily confused. | That's perfectly fine but I think we'll have to agree to disagree because I found him very boring. | Don‚Äôt get me started on Ivar. What a douche. I thought perhaps hating him so much made him a great character, but I almost gave up on the show completely because I hated him so much. | Reading _any_ of the comments in this post and then complaining about spoilers is peak reddit. | This is ridiculous. What did you expect? You chose to read a thread about actors leaving shows which automatically is a spoiler to the show... Thats like complaining you got wet because you put your feet in the pool. | > I think the show was still pretty solid up until the Professor was killed off.

True, but the professor being killed off and the addition of Maggie weren't the reason for the failure, they were the symptoms. The producers wanted less sci-fi and more action. John Rhys-Davies pitched an idea for an episode, they butchered it and he objected, so he ended up quitting.

> Then, of course, the addition of the Kromaggs

The Kromaggs were actually introduced earlier. The problem with them was when they became reoccurring villains. | To spice up a long running show I could tolerate a seasonal villain, even a stupid one. But it needs to come second to the what if concept of the show and actually be entertaining. 

The Kromaggs are one of the dumbest villains ever. Are they conquerors, eyeball eaters, breeding camp slavers, winning, losing? They also took up far too many episodes. At most they should have been seen 3-4 times the whole series. 

Rickman was over used, and his episodes were ridiculous. 

When it comes to villains season 5 has the best one. The villain basically existed as an excuse for why Quinn wasn't in the show and to characterize the new characters. And his villainy fits into the science of the show. | I stopped watching around when Arturo was killed off so I never knew how Wade was written off and looking it up now, WTF. | Could be a new show entirely, doesn't need to be related to the original characters. The concept itself is good enough to stand on its own. | I would much rather see a brand new show and maybe feature the original actors in some interesting background roles for an episode or two. | Completely agree. Nathan was amazing but I think they still made it work after he left, especially from adding Rudy. To me, once Simon and Alisha left, it was really done. | The guy who plays Rudy stars in a really good show (imo) at the minute, called Brassic, it's a comedy about incompetent petty criminals. | I had the theme song as my ring tone for a bit | You'd screw your own sister for a slice of cheese


I don't even like cheese


That makes it even worse you sick bastard | Monkey slut | My dumb teenager ass wrote that on my wall lol | I still say this. That whole episode was brilliant | He went from Misfits to Love/Hate, and honestly, as good as those first couple seasons of Misfits was, his work on Love/Hate was phenomenal. | Yup. We knew him at the time, totally his call. | He carried the show when everyone else left, but it wasn't enough to make it as good as before, unfortunately.

Third Rudy was such a good episode tho | Yeah, love it! | That's even worse 

You sick bastard | ""That makes it even worse, you sick bastard"" | I feel like Joe got the shit end of the stick because everyone saw Rudy as a cheap Nathan replacement but Rudy was truly his own sort of angel/beast and he did a greatttt job playing him. I think the Rudy‚Äôs truly came across as different characters. | Thank you! | The saying comes from Fonz jumping a shark when the show got silly. I‚Äôm sayin this guy suggests it already jumped the shark before the saying even existed when Ron Howard left | Yup | I'd argue against that.  Howard was always portrayed as understanding and loving of his kids regardless what they did, and accepting of just about everyone which went against normal practices of the time. | Until Frankie learned the steel drums. | Which is funny because when Dorothy and Sophia dressed as Sonny and Cher for the mother/daughter competition Blanche asked which is Cheech and which one's Chong, so Cheech Marin already exists in the Golden Girls universe as himself.¬† | Cheech made the only joke I still remember from the show, and it makes me laugh to this day.  In one episode, the hotel staff discover that one of the guests is a gigolo.  The girls are scandalized, but Cheech is intrigued and asks the guy about his job.

Gigolo: ‚ÄúThe most important thing is that you have to be able to have sex with women you‚Äôre not attracted to.‚Äù  
Cheech: ‚ÄúMan, I been practicing for this job my whole life!‚Äù | And a young don cheadle | Yes, Gideon and Hotch were bad blows, but then to lose the Morgan and Garcia relationship AND they kept torturing poor   Spencer. It became really hard to watch. | Did he die? Also I loved his sibling like relationship with Reid. | Then you definitely would hate the reboot. The reboot is phenomenal because it is far more gritty and real but it‚Äôs also way darker. I can‚Äôt get back and watch anything past the first couple seasons because I enjoy the reboot that much more. Feels like a different show with the exact same characters. | ¬†It‚Äôs why Mandy Patinkin left. He felt the show was far too gruesome and didn‚Äôt like the direction.¬† | Wow, so he's the opposite of his character. | Yikes hope he worked that out but I haven't seen him in anything since so either he's been blacklisted or never got help....or he retired | Talk about killing the golden goose. Criminal minds went on for over a decade after they fired him. | We need Reid back!! | The show itself ultimately became a zombie. | Honestly I tuned out after the Governor came back and the music might as well have gone ""DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN."" It's a show that simultaneously has no stakes and will also kill off any character you get invested in. | I got tired of it when I realized every episode would be ‚Äúalright, we have to be quiet, nobody‚Äî‚Äú ***\*\*\*LOUD NOISE\*\*\**** ‚ÄúRUN! OH NO, SOMEONE GOT BIT OR DIED!‚Äù. There‚Äôs only so many times you can rewatch the same thing. | It became a repetitive variation of the same theme with tons of filler. Everything after season one is just meh to bad. | Wait is the show still going!? | Rick, Carl and co. end up going to the Commonwealth which is featured in the last few seasons of the show.

The political turmoil, sort of like what happens in the series, occurs but Rick manages to calm the citizens and they rally to him and depose Milton. Rick see's an opportunity with the Commonwealth's resources and the other communites to get things back under control finally.

However Milton's son Sebastian resents Rick for what he did and kills him in his sleep. Carl has to put zombie Rick down and he jails Sebastian. Setting an example that things are gonna change and not be as savage as they were, like his dad wanted.

It then time jumps **years later**. Carl is now a man, married with a child to Sophia (Who didn't die in the comics). Society has largely more or less become Rick's vision and dealt with the walker problem to point of where they are ignored or forgotten  

Some are even used in a circus as attractions. A walker that wanders away from the circus is killed by Carl and he is actually reprimanded by the authorities for doing so as it was ""someones property"", but he is let off as he is Rick Grimes son who has been deified in this new world.

So yeah it all ends on a pretty peaceful note with everything becoming somewhat ""normal"" again. Negan stays in his cabin in the woods and does not return like in the series. Carl goes to visit him one day and he is gone. His fate is left ambiguious except for the fact he is likely travelling elsewhere.
 
The last panel ends with Carl telling the story of his father to his daughter, Andrea, while a large statue of Rick stands in front of the courthouse in the Commonwealth.

Edit: I really like this ending as when I read it, I was expecting it to all end in tragedy, but to find it all ends on a somewhat happy note was unexpected.

It made me smile that the twist was a happy ending after all they went through. | I was more mad at Abraham than Glenn because, like you said, most of us knew Glenn was coming. They gave someone else Abe‚Äôs comic death, which combined with Kirkman stating he always wondered how things would‚Äôve turned out if Abe was alive for All Out War, had many people thinking we‚Äôd be getting to see it. Instead, they just made him a cheap secondary death in the lineup. So stupid. But Carl was what killed the show for me. | What makes it worse is the supposed reason Carl was killed off in the first place was because Chandler Riggs was turning 18 and due for a big bump in pay. The studio denied this but Chandler‚Äôs dad got on SM and claimed this was the reason. | Beth was done disrespectful too lol | Carl also survived LOOOOOONG past that in the comics. |   Kirkland's intention was Carl was supposed to eventually fill Rick's shoes as a leader who grew up mostly post apocalypse and understood how to survive in that world.

  
  The show writers/producers intentions were that he not make it to 18 because they would have to pay him more money.  This is likely why Enid was killed off also.  I was also done with the show after that decision and how they acted like it was for the story when it was actually about $ | I found his character annoying because he couldn‚Äôt act. Surprised everyone went on to love him so much | Arguably, it‚Äôs realistic. | Yeah agee. Carl is NOT my favourite character, not by a mile.. but where tf was the story gonna go now? | Can confirm. I binged the whole series in January. It falls off a damn cliff after the whole Negan arc. | I would say whoever is reading this comment, Season 5 and 6 are regarded as the best seasons and when TWD was reaching high viewership, getting to the start of season 7 is when it slows down to shit and drops off a cliff | JDM had a really good character with a whole lot of potential but sadly they had already decided that the show should be formulaic and stretched out as much as possible. | Yeah the once scene with Maggie after all that was enough for me to be like I'm good ending here. | I disagree. The Governor season was my least favorite, and I don‚Äôt think it even got good until the Alexandria arc. | It‚Äôs not worth it | Yeah, I don't know. I'm generally not a squeamish person or anything, but that moment really took me out of the show. It just seemed sensationalistic and almost deliberately cruel to the viewing audience. It didn't make me mad or anything, but it was sort of like finding out a good friend did something you're not exactly sure how to respond to. I didn't even make an active decision to stop watching. When the following season started up, it just was never a priority to me to keep watching. | Y'all are forgetting about Andy Wilman, the producer who's like the ""5th Beatle"" for Top Gear and all related projects. He's often held responsible for turning the brand around from a boring car review show to an empire. He helped modernize the format, make it cool, flashy, and comedic, and let Clarkson go off unhinged. | I‚Äôm so not ready for it to end. | I think probably up to season 21 I stopped watching I think for me after that and TGT it felt too forced, like they were trying to hard to fit the chemistry of the wrapper) earlier seasons | Thats show is so incredibly funny and wholesome. Highly recommend if you like top gear. | Jeremy would make an entertaining show about anything.¬† With anyone.


Caleb has absolutely 0 acting skills and it's still entertaining.¬†


Charlie has an accountant personality and again, entertaining as heck.


Even these would be hits:


Jeremy's:


Septic tank cleaning business


Home improvement cie


Computer repair shop


Think of any profession, and it would be fun to watch. | In the UK, Countryfile, a program largely about farming, is one of the most watched shows on broadcast TV in the UK. It could never get the international viewing of Clarkson's Farm though. | My mom absolutely loves this show. One of the only ones she actually tells us is on Amazon prime. Because she cannot figure out how the hell to work that thing to save her life but she somehow knows there's a new season. | I lile the part where it's revealed he has been eating lobster shit for a long time | There are a couple of British subreddits that show up on my popular feed occasionally, and I recently read a post from a disgruntled customer of the pub he opened to serve/showcase his organic produce. For some reason, the poster- who had travelled a bit of a distance on his motorbike- was upset about the traffic in the mostly-rural area, and the crowd and the high prices at the pub. It was a weird post‚Ä¶ I almost got the impression that the person wasn‚Äôt a fan, and had mostly made the trip there so they could find something to complain about. Clarkson is probably a more polarizing character over there. | Never really watch Top Gear only clips. I didn't know he made a show about farming. | I couldn't get more than a couple episodes into Clarkson's Farm. What killed it for me was someone saying ""Do it this way"" and he just decides to do it another way for no reason besides being an ass. And of course the recommended reason had reason.


""Oh, he's just purposely being an ass for ratings now.""


Which is what much of entertainment is, but it was too transparent. | The sports lorry is Burma not Bolivia. There is a top gear Bolivia special but I don't remember any rock throwing 

I think you're thinking of the Colombia special where James throws a rock at Jeremys jeep [clip](https://youtu.be/tllkZpK7xnE?si=bmI-Zdx_5YErf740) | IMO what makes him watchable, and a good tv show host is that yes, he‚Äôs a prick, but he‚Äôs not too proud. His schtick is being deliberately obtuse, and being the butt of the joke - which isn‚Äôt something many pricks would do. | https://www.carthrottle.com/news/the-grand-tour-new-presenters | I‚Äôm not a car guy, nor am I European, but I watched every dam episode I could until they left the show. The personalities and how they interacted with one another, the banter and respectful jabs, the hilarity of the obviously dumb builds for a cheap laugh. The show just had charm. When they all left, everything that defined the show went with them. | Original Top Gear was boring as shit before Clarkson & Wilman revived it in 2002 (James May was briefly a co-presenter in 1999 and got fired) | I might have continued watching it, depending on who they got as presenters. But they got Chris Evans. | I don't care of it's an unpopular opinion - Clarkson deserved to be fucking fired, especially since his long string of causing problems and the final straw being the fact he beat the shit out of a show staffer for something the latter had no control of. | Fact is that all of the hosts outside of Clarkson, Hammond and May *tried* to be funny, and that's exactly why they weren't. Clarkson and co were funny without trying, it was just three blokes doing dumb bloke things. | I didn‚Äôt enjoy LeBlanc so much, and that entire group lacked chemistry. I felt Flintoff, Harris, and McGuinness were really finding their stride before that terrible accident. |  Chris Harris is fantastic and of the Top Gear mold. He's an actual motor journalist - the problem with all the replacement presenters is they're people who like cars, not people who live and breathe them. | I would very much like to forget Noel Edmonds | I don't think either Freddie or Paddy had the car knowledge one should have on the show and that to me is the missing ingredient. 

But the three of them were the best group they managed in the later years. 

Also, I liked Sabine a lot and really think she would have been a great permanent addition has she not tragically passed so young. | There's what?! Tony and Ziva were really the only reason I watched. Gibbs was good too, but those two were the best. I'm looking forward to that. | Thank goodness it‚Äôs not only me. That was my comfort show for years and years. It will be so nice to see them on TV again. | So extremely excited!! | The what now | Wait, Gary Cole in on NCIS now? | They really still have great characters. Its not the same but still good. | Oi Hughey, I wrote a damn fine jingle I did | i would absolutely have watched the show if billy butcher was there | In Australia we have the series run on repeat week nights. They play the full series so right now it‚Äôs the Kutcher episodes where they‚Äôve adopted the kid. I can‚Äôt get into the Kutcher seasons so I‚Äôve got little idea of what‚Äôs going on and I don‚Äôt know how they end up losing or giving up the kid as he‚Äôs not in the final episodes. | They play Asthon Kutchers episodes so much the channels I watch. It's so bad! | You were right the first time. | Oi Alan, we've gotta kill 'omelandah | Charlie Sheen said they wouldn't have a show without him, so if they cancelled it too quickly that would be admitting defeat proving him right, despite the fact he was correct. | Spite. Spite is the reason. | I don‚Äôt mind raunchy comedy. I just don‚Äôt like unfunny corny comedy | Shows how subjective humor is. I have never even smiled at a joke in that show, I shudder whenever I enter a room where someone has left that show on the TV. | The best trash üóëÔ∏è | Because you happened to like that one. It's the same quality as all his stuff, just not all of it lands with you.

I don't know why people struggle so much to accept that there are many great shows out there that they will personally not enjoy, but that doesn't actually make them bad. | Besides no laugh track I think that the show being about the Cooper family and not just some dudes with misogynistic views it's what made it so good. Also George Sr. being a good that actually. | I stand by something I said once that Malcolm in the middle walked so young Sheldon could run. Although it's definitely more serious than any other show Chuck did. If it wasn't attached to the Big Bang Theory more people would be open to it. | No laugh track? | 1. The show kinda sucked regardless 
2. I‚Äôm calm, but definitely don‚Äôt tell me what to do | Thank you for posting this, I had no idea and genuinely this healed me a little | These where great, so I'm glad he left Bones. | Sam Weir grew up to direct a D&D movie? That is perfectly heartwarming. | Seeing what u/SugarNSpite1440 posted above, kind of makes it easier to bear.

>The actor was in a position to direct a movie and asked for the time off to do so. They wouldn't give it to him so he asked to be killed off. He wanted to leave because he wanted to direct. | Dude was the young kid in Waiting that freaks out in the end!? I had no idea. | Wth no way. He absolutely made the right choice to leave Bones then. | Especially when you find out that‚Äôs a bs rumor. He never asked to be killed off. The showrunners did it and he wasnt happy. He wanted to comeback here and there and they decided ‚Äúno, let‚Äôs kill you instead!‚Äù | It's not really that easy though. The season is mapped out months before writing begins and then the season begins filming...so even if they had allowed him to come back they would have had to, in the middle of everything (depending when his project got the greenlight) written him out (plausibly) for possibly two seasons and then figured out how to suddenly write his character back in. And it's not just the TV schedule to consider. It takes months of preproduction (and rehearsals for stunt heavy films) to get prep for a movie, then 6 weeks to sometimes 6+ months of filming (for movies with lots of stunts and reshoots), and then 1-3 years (depending on how much post production or cgi is needed) to finish a film. So a MINIMUM of a year and a half to three years. And the director is the one person who is there for every single step, making every single approval and decision, and giving every final say on things. Then there's promotional time, premieres, talk show circuit and interviews for big projects like he got. So, in reality, he would have probably been gone for 2-3 seasons before being available to then come back...if he had wanted to. He may have been more interested in lining up another directorial project than being in acting at that time. | I believe the creator wanted to call it a spinoff, but got overruled. That's why they slammed Med School in the opening.¬† | They half did by calling it scrubs med school but also advertised it as season 9. Should have fully gone with the spin off | Did they not? Only ever watched a rerun or two but here in the UK it was called scrubs:med school. | Wasn't it titled ""Scrubs: Med School"" and released as a web series? | Yeah and even then what it was wasnt that great to begin with so i just like to pretend it never happened | I believe it was billed as a spinoff, but after it tanked they slapped it back on to the main show for DVD/streaming/logistical reasons. | This what I thought. Season 9 wasn't totally bad as it's own show. Like, if I was to compare, I would say that season 9 of Scrubs was better than season 1 of Parks and Rec.

It would be interesting to see if they had spun scrubs off during the 8th season of Scrubs. Maybe that would have given them time to find their feet. | AND ***Mrs.*** Turkleton! | You think my name is Turk Turkleton? | Yeah wasnt the same without the turkletons | I watched the behind the scenes on that one, and the producer described that when they got picked up to do the ninth season they were told that everyone could come back at the same pay, but nobody would get a raise. One person tried to ask for a raise, and they just got dropped. 

Always got the impression that was who it was. | That's Mrs. Turkleton to you. | Were either of the Turkletons in it anymore? I stopped watching with that stupid JD gets random lady he has no chemistry with pregnant plot


Shes even a good actor too she was great in 30 Rock. | Carla as a character absolutely bugged the life out of me, as bad as the season was I didn't miss her at all | And they tried to change the name to something like Scrubs Med, but the studio shot it down. | It's a completely different programme with a legacy title. It's weird. | There wasn‚Äôt. | There‚Äôs a season 3? I stopped watching when season 2 started giving me Velma vibes. | no, its actually more disappointing than that. The original writers started thinking of allowing new writers take the reins in terms of what story wants to be told.

  
Imediately the new writers thought that Joan was the true voice (of the new writers) instead of Abe being the voice of the original writers.

  
So its not that they are like ""wow everything is woke now"", its more like the new writers are like ""yeah, everything is woke now and that's better and fuck all the previous vibe and themes of the original show"" | I‚Äôm sure it heavily affected the writers room and everyone else on the show, but the voice actors had renegotiated their pay when season 10 was in production and it was the second season of the Mike Scully years. Mike Scully was the show runner for seasons 9-12 and he was well liked by the staff and everyone else involved with the show, but he also wanted to play it safe and not let the show jump the shark. While this is all well and good, it‚Äôs not what the executives want and he was replaced by Al Jean for the next 12 seasons. 

I like the Scully years, i think he knew what made the show good, but he was handed the show at a precarious place. The plateau is short and the drop is sometimes slow, but everything drops in the end. | ""1. They don't have beaks. 2. They don't have feathers and 3. They are lizards!"" | Wait, who did he play? | Thank you, Walton Goggins | He also was incredibly difficult to work with and an unrepentant asshole on set in a way that apparently almost rivaled Dan's behavior. | Dan was forced out for sexually harassing a female writer to the point of a lawsuit. He is a scumbag. | +1 to S5 being hugely underrated. There are some fantastic episodes. The Ass Crack Bandit, Meow Meow Beenz, and literally any scene with Jonathan Banks in it. I thought it was great. | Seasons 5 and 6 have some of the best episodes in the series imo. | The people have voted! | Season 5 had Meow Meow Beanz which is one of my top 5 episodes. | The final 2 episodes of season 6 are both phenomenal. | Damn I may have to pick up season 6 then, I watched 5 and sort of lost my way with it | I really hope they bring them back (and maybe even Jonathan Banks) even though it sounds like most of the original cast will be returning. Even though they were replacements, they all did a great job as additions to the show and shouldn't be forgotten. Brewster, in particular, was an excellent foil to both Jeff and the Dean. | Those 2 really nailed it.  Garrett's wedding episode is one of the funniest 30 minutes of television ever made. | It was but they were kind of forced into it.   He made the choice to leave and I think it was fairly sudden. | This. The stupid way they killed him off, in the Christmas special no less, was just so petty. It totally broke my immersion and I didn't care enough to try to get it back. | Exactly! I live and breathe for Maggie Smith's cutting wit and Michelle Dockery's stank face in this show.¬†


I was also really wanted Lady Mary to get with the guy she went on a sex vacation with. I don't get the car guy. | She has an autoimmune disease which made the demands very difficult for her. What really ticked her off was her costar got sick, and the studio gave him a month off to go home to England to recover. When her illness flared up, they gave her no such consideration until she needed to be admitted to a hospital.  When she recovered, she refused to go back to work, I don't blame her. That's definitely not good to her.  

https://deadline.com/2020/06/nicole-beharie-sleepy-hollow-exit-controversy-impact-career-1202965074/ | She did get killed off | I was hooked on it for pretty much exactly the first 1.5 seasons. Then they decided to do a whole Olympic hurdles race of shark jumping. | I made it a few episodes in the first season after he left. Googled when he was comeing back saw never and and said fuck it I'm done. | But Big Bang Theory without Sheldon sounds like an infinitely better show. | All the finale talking heads were cutting onions tier, but this one really hit the hardest. | And ""That was an over reaction"". | Technically it still did | Asian Jim was the best cold-open despite being in a later season | Didn't they find out that Pam is pregnant before they got married? | Don't forget the artistry that was the episode with the plot about Nespresso ^tm | They found out she was pregnant before the wedding though. That was the finale of the previous season | I am the fucking Lizard King. | I like this.

I've long been a ""The Office would have ended perfectly after Jim asks Pam out because we know they will work out"" guy. But I enjoy a lot of the season four and five episodes and Jim finding out Pam's pregnant is a precious special moment. I agree on RC as well, he was a true treat and Michael's goodbye is heartfelt. And again, like you mentioned, the finale is such an amazing end. | It's four seasons really and a lot to dredge through to get there | The wedding was toward the beginning of season 6. The show went 9 seasons, so almost 4 full seasons after the wedding.

I think Michael Schur learned a lot from the later seasons of the office and parks and rec if you look at The Good Place. It had a defined planned ending and they wrote to it. | Dwight and Angela's wedding was the finale, Jim and Pam might be what the other poster meant in terms of wedding | I'm a huge fan of The Office, so take this with a grain of salt. They didn't squeeze anything out of the show until the end of season 8, season 9 still has some good stuff but that also feels squeezed. The writing staff and acting talent contained within The Office was incredible. Maybe it overstayed it's welcome, but, at least in hindsight, it earned the right to do so. | This right here. I actually really enjoyed Seasons 8 and 9. By this time Rainn Wilson, John K, and Ed Helms are superstar actors by this point on the level of Steve Carrell, so they held their own. 

I just never understood why they did Andy so dirty, it was such a horrible arc for him. The show should‚Äôve had Nellie be some sort of villain, and Andy redeeming himself and a marriage with Erin, similar to the Charles Minor arc. | Andy was always an asshole. | It was basically all the characters by that point for me. They all went from struggling with poverty, dealing with absentee/addict parents, and just doing what they can to scrape by, to being self-sabotaging adults who do thing because ""We hood AF."" 90% of the conflict in the last few seasons was them fucking up their own lives, despite entering successful careers. | Debbie really became a character with zero redeeming qualities. She basically did everything wrong and some really heinous shit compared to her siblings. With them, you can at least point to some good qualities like how Fiona was generally a supportive and giving person who prioritized her family or how Carl frequently tried to fight for the people in his community. Debbie just sucked. | I was gutted when they had Lip waste his potential. It was fairly realistic as far as I can remember but it was their best opportunity to show a storyline about getting out of poverty. And watching him struggle with navigating that new world would have been much more interesting to watch than just ‚Äònever mind, he‚Äôs just the new Frank but less comical‚Äô. | By then there were more adults in the family so it really wasn't an abandonment issue. | And because of the people he was brutalizing. If this was Law and Order: Crack and Burglaries division, it wouldn't have hit everyone's justice meter so much. | lmao | YOU HAD SEX WITH HER SHE WAS ONLY 23 YEARS OLD YOU SICK **FUCK** | ROFL well | I fucking *LOVE* Barba!!  His episodes on the other side of the aisle just show how incredible he really is. He walks all over Carisi, even when they're obviously trying to downplay it. | They killed off his wife when Stabler returned. | He was Julia Roberts' fiance in *Runaway Bride* and was delightful in that role, though I haven't watched that movie in ages. It probably doesn't hold up, but I do remember really liking his character | He's also hilarious in Harley Quinn as Commissioner Gordon | He WEILDS another rapist!? | They're making a new season. | But it's still a great adaptation, in my opinion. While it differs in a lot of ways, it still absolutely feels like it respects the source material and makes sure it hits a lot of the important story beats.

It's also one of my favorite adaptations, because they just lay out the fact that >!the show and book are two different cycles (of many) the Watcherwoman enacted, so they actually coexist!<. It was a fairly brilliant way of them using what was in the book to basically say, ""Yeah, we're telling the story differently... but there's a reason why."" | I love the show, discovered it years after it began. Would u recommend the books to someone that has watched the series first? | Honestly that makes me more inclined to give the show a chance. I read the first book and a bit of the second, but I found Quentin‚Äôs relentless ennui insufferable, so I stopped. | Probably why I couldn't get into it. It was very different from the Books. | Yeah, a reason why I couldn't get into the show. I've tried a couple times but can't do it. | I loved Margo's journey, true highlight of the show for me. | that is an interesting interpretation of what happened | The endless sad music montage. It felt half a season long. | Nah I have no respect for the late season writers lmao. Tanked the show irreparably.

That said, in keeping with the spirit of the question I‚Äôd still say Charles Dance, but yes the writing was the issue. I‚Äôd like to think that he‚Äôd still put on a great performance, and I‚Äôm sure he would, but other actors who I thought were phenomenal in the early run felt like cosplayers in the final seasons. The writing was just so comically bad. | Along with How I Met Your Mother or Friends, it‚Äôs a good background show. Easy to keep up with while barely watching/listening and for the most part not distracting. 

I get why a lot of people don‚Äôt like it‚Ä¶canned laughter, forced jokes, tired tropes. BUT I can also see why there‚Äôs a lot of fans, and for its purpose, it deserved to run as long as it did. | I liked it.  I have a PhD in Biochemistry  and still loved the show, despite Reddit thinking no scientist would actually enjoy it.  I also enjoyed Young Sheldon. | I like it and still watch episodes.

It was one of my Mom's favorite too, and when I'd visit her we'd watch it. When she got too sick, we'd just order food in (or I'd cook), and me and dad and her would pile into the bed (with her beloved dogs) and watch a few episodes before she got tired and fell asleep.

I wish she had been able to see the end. 

Love you Mom, RIP. | Plenty of nerds enjoy it. The ones who hate on it seem to think it's either insulting them, or they're insulted on the behalf of others. It's harmless comedy, and the earlier seasons at least are genuinely funny without over-explaining the science every time. It definitely lost a lot of subtlety later on but what show doesn't do that. | I liked it too. | Nah, I enjoyed it too. Reddit just hates it for the most part. | There are lots of us who enjoy it. For some reason it just gets a lot of hate on Reddit.

My mother (now passed) used to enjoy it, making comments like ""That's just like your friend"", or worse, ""That reminds me of you."" | It's not in my top 10 list or anything, but it's an easy watch  with the occasional laugh. I don't understand the hate. | You're not alone. I think it's mostly internet people that hate it. Real people (myself included) love it. | I enjoy it, too. It‚Äôs one of the few shows that everyone could sit around and enjoy. | I enjoy it. I don't go out of my way to watch it but it's inoffensive and I get a few laughs an episode¬† | Yeah kinda sad that I love it even with Sheldon airing I still love TBBT | No, I absolutely love that show! | Bah, u/Honorable_Cingetion is clearly mad about the giant dump someone took in his bowl of corn flakes. | Yeah I‚Äôm not denying it‚Äôs a popular show, but IMo it‚Äôs awful. | My family always used to watch it every week, but even we tapped out after 3 or 4 seasons. It seemed like there were a lot more recycled jokes popping up and the writers were quickly running out of ideas.

I couldn't believe it when I saw that it lasted past 10 seasons. | I might be really obvious to me once you say it, but what is the other spin-off (aside from Young Sheldon)? | Single cam? | first episode I tried to watch had a racist joke within 10 mins. I was like Nope, not dealing with this | I try and never miss the chance to say how much I loathe Calliou and the selfish brattiness he taught millions of 4 year olds was a way to get whatever you want. Thank you for giving me that opportunity this morning. 

I loathe Calliou. | His father died a couple of years before TBBT came out. I bet that he would have loved what his son was doing with the character. | Fuck Andy Dick | Yup. Rewatching the Simpsons with my kids...


I'm troy mclure.


Gets me in the feels. | Despite never having seen a single episode, I still remember my favorite line of his from that show.....""Are you questioning my constitutional right to make nude phone calls?"" üòÇ | Then I'm in good company | It can be both.¬†


Fuck her too, but fuck Andy Dick especially. For that and many other reasons.¬† | Oh man, if you saw where he was now it's like a porn star living under a bridge in Vegas like the troll he is. | That was Myra when she was top dog if I remember correctly. | *cough cough* Lost | A cat and mouse season, yeah. | Bonehead network executives. | I watched the whole thing and literally couldn't tell you the ending of Gossip Girl if my life depended on it.¬† | His ideas would have to include character development. Half the cliches and tropes they used wouldn't work at a Comm College.  

Interestlyly enough, during *Where are they now* reunion type shows, they all say John Sylvester White (Mr. Woodman) was the most talented and funniest guy in the bunch. They all wanted him to have a bigger role in the writing and to use some of his ad libbing. But just like they did to Kaplan, the producers said no. | Well, makes sense. Firstly hars to manage anything with that much trouble and for the rest, working the same thing for a decade must get old. | I probably watch that Honda clip with Paget and the Dean once a week. | Don't forget the Dean and the olives. I've never laughed so hard while watching TV in my life. | Costner has publicly stated that he had finished playing John Dutton prior to the start of filming for S5 part 2.  So apart from flashbacks or previously un-aired footage, he won't appear in part 2.

To explain his absence, his character pretty much has to die. | I am really enjoying it. | I agree. His cool definitely made the first season super fun! So it might have helped the second‚Ä¶ it still hurts though‚Ä¶ first season was so good | Ugh, thanks for reminding me. The whole experience was just terrible. God awful. I‚Äôd never felt such a disappointing downturn. 

Every other show mentioned here is like ‚Äúyeah, wasn‚Äôt as good‚Äù but *this one* just became insufferable. A husk of its former self. So damn depressing‚Ä¶ | Agree. | Yes, I couldnt believe it at first that they'd actually killed her. I was kind of excited about where they'd go from there. And then they didnt really go anywhere at all, like. 

It had some memorable characters though. Tommy Egan, Kanan, Dre, Joe Proctor (Turtle üòç), Raina. Tasha, too. | I feel the same way about the show supernatural.  The individual episodes are great.  Story line totally messes it up for me | Dude yes! I'm currently rewatching and ha've been wondering if anyone has done some kind of cut of the series with only MOTW episodes. I could not care less about Mulder's sister or whatever illness Scully has currently. I want to see them hunt for a goat man in bumfuck Arkansas. | I should do the same! I started a rewatch and got bogged down in the plot-heavy episodes. I used to love those, but it‚Äôs the stand-alones that are the best now. | Many years ago when I downloaded the whole series I decided to rename all the files and separate them into conspiracy arc episodes and monster of the week episodes. It made it so much easier to binge the show depending on your mood.

Watching it in chronological order can get exhausting, but the conspiracy arc flows much better when you can just drop them all into the same playlist together. Or the standalone episodes of your choice are great when they're not getting interrupted by the heavy-handed drama of the conspiracy arc. | I can't bring myself to skip the mytharc episodes because those are the ones where Mulder and Scully are the most ""us against the world"" supportive of each other. | I did that with my friend who had never seen the show. I cherry picked all the monster of the week episodes, then was like, ok. If you *really* want to go down the rabbit hole, they've got some stories about aliens and maybe a stand alone movie with a decent soundtrack | I can‚Äôt think of another show that so clearly tried to have an overall story arc without coming up with a series bible. | I still don‚Äôt completely get the main arc. To be fair I missed or forgot about some episodes but it is just blur. | i'm all about Mythology and was the opposite, motw eps while fun i find i could have done without. It's why Fight the Future was so amazing, it was ALL mythology. MilleniuM was also SO great as a show. | Can you imagine that....and I think it could work to remove that whole over reaching arc...

Mulder has all these conspiracy theories about aliens and government cover ups etc, and each week they go through these monster of the week issues making his beliefs more concrete, they come across all these cases of the unusual, of course the truth has to be out there... But it isn't, those earthly events are just weird stuff and he is just a bit of a conspiracy theory nut | This is the appropriate way to do a rewatch, IMHO. | That's what I did when I had to lie in bed for 3 months: Watched all the ""monster of the week episodes"" | That's why I didn't watch the show much originally, if I could find a monster of the week, I was happy. | Too many writers trying to go in too many different directions. | Wife and I just re arched out tones of every season and left it at that. Nothing beyond season 7 made the cut. | I was skeptical at first, but the more I think about it, that would be an awesome episode! | It could've happened! The X-Files was miles ahead of the rest with its meta-episodes (Jose Chung's From Outer Space, Bad Blood, Postmodern Prometheus) where they toyed with the narrative and perspectives. It wasn't always great but when it was good, it was amazing. | That's the best fan suggested episode suggestion I've ever seen.

They don't even need to be together, War of the Copraghes had amazing chemistry and for most of it they were on the phone. | We all hoped for that hard smash. Oh.. not what you meant? Sorry | ""In and out, 20 minutes adventure."" | That‚Äôs a great idea for anything, really. X-Files is perfect for it but you could totally just write a short story like this for other characters. Flex that brain muscle and put this idea on paper. | My sister would make fun of me because I hate the ‚Äúpoint‚Äù of the show, lol. I love all the stand alones, but oh my god if I had to hear about Samantha, I almost wouldn‚Äôt watch‚Ä¶but I would because Gillian and David had that amazing chemistry. | That would be a great episode. | Rick and morty did this more or less. Just as an opener nit a whoke episode | Yeah it's a creepy and disturbing episode lol | I love the season 7 monster of the week episodes, honestly.  I feel like their chemistry is at a peak and the mood is a little lighter even when the investigation is intense. | It's wild to think how many main plot events are completely dependent on Scully's ... unplanned vacation, shall we say, given that it was entirely random because Gillian Anderson was pregnant. | That was a brutal roast, wonder what happened to him. He destroyed everyone on the dias that day | That's our scumbag! | I love how  *2 and a Half Men* had to kill Charlie off TWICE. | I loved threes company growing up to.  It was a sad day when we lost the extremely talented John Ritter.  I love seeing his son in movies. | John was having a career resurgence. He did the 'Problem Child' movies and IT and was having a few down years and was coming back to TV. Gosh, that news broke the 14 year old me when I heard. | Same. I was so so so happy that he finally found a project worthy of him. And I was so happy for Katey Sagal too! It was nice seeing her out from the shadow of Peggy Bundy (who she was amazing as) and Ed O‚ÄôNeil. I worked on the show the season after he died. The crew told me he actually died in his dressing room but for whatever legal reasons they said it was the hospital. That‚Äôs just what I heard. Who knows if it was true. | Ritter left Three's Company long before he died.  He was making a new show-8 Simple Rules for Dating my Daughter- when he died. | Yeah, I remember that half more because I feel like it had more poignant moments. The episode I remember the most is when Bridget is mourning but doesn't want to be sad, and Amy is happy but feels like she shouldn't be. I think about it every time someone in my life passes away. | Clearly, you didn't watch Just Shoot Me, or Tommy Boy, or Black Sheep. | I would disagree with this. Is he a top tier actor? No. 

But he‚Äôs done decent stuff and can do good comedy if given the right material. He‚Äôs not Rob Schneider bad. | By ""ignore"" I mean giving an offhand explanation (see Cara Dune). | Morality clauses have existed for a long time. Not really sure they would be enforceable with just hearsay, but lawyers are gunna lawyer. | That may well be the truth behind what I heard at the time, it certainly seems plausible. | > ‚Äúget accused of bad things in the media and we can fire you‚Äù

_‚ÄùAlright, Mr. Spacey, one more page. Yes, okay, just sign here, initial here, and write out your twitter password here and we‚Äôre all finished. We really look forward to working with you on this final season.‚Äù_ | Nothing can top the threechum | Specific juries can find someone ‚Äúnot guilty‚Äù or ‚Äúnot liable‚Äù for cases even when the public evidence points to them being guilty. Not everything is allowed to be presented to juries and a million other things can happen as well.


But when over a dozen mostly unconnected people come forward with accusations against him, with at least one of the accusations originally publicly made in 2001 but with his name redacted. When multiple prosecutors in multiple countries believed they had enough to convict and 1 case only got dropped after the victim died. 

That tells me he probably assaulted some people. | I was gonna say. He's never throwing that, no matter what the judicial system says. | It's not that simple. He was known around Hollywood as a predator for a long time. That was not an isolated incident. Hell, 8 people *who worked on House of Cards* also accused him of sexual misconduct.

It's also just really difficult to prove sexual harassment at all, much less decades after it happened, and even less against a person with an army of top lawyers.

I don't know if he did that one crime or not. But when there are this many signs all pointing to this dude being a creep, he's probably a creep. | That's a huge, dumb leap from what I said but ok | Not that I disagree with this sentiment, but rich people also have access to less than ethical resources as well. Like hush money and bribe type resources. | Lol this makes absolutely no sense as a counterargument to what I said | Good thing that  was disocvered and not the fact he sexually assaulted 3 women he is currently serving time for.

Show would've been AWKWARD after that. | The curly hair and mentality he had made sense..! | [removed] | I think it is the subplots, I didn't realize the Leo one was in the 8th season. The good stories mostly feel like they were in another season. | Oops | Oh they‚Äôll make it and then cancel it. ¬†It‚Äôs more valuable as a tax write off than a streaming ip that nobody watches.¬† | my wife and I watched the 1st season twice. and she had to read about it online, she woke me up at 2am and filled me in on how the timeline worked. | For real. They had no problem throwing George under a bus (literally), they let Derek hit by a speeding semi truck in the middle of the canyon, Lexipedia and Mark got rekted by a plane crash, but hey let‚Äôs make a fake Lizzie live happily ever after with a fake Alex in a farm somewhere because LOLOL. | Did you know that wolves don't have alphas, but bunnies do?

I think of that when anyone calls themselves an alpha. | I just watched that one! The lead up to it with the group seemed like it could have had suspense, some of the whispering parts and the graveyard were alright, but that line was like watching a giant balloon deflate. | One of my old teachers told me I ""lacked"" commitment. 

I watched every MFing episode of TWD. 

How's about that Mrs Smith you piss smelling old harridan. | I watched this arc for Samantha Morton but like, I was sad for her. She's such a great actress. | Exactly the same here. Never watched another episode after that. | It's an annoying trope in television, I feel. I believe it's because, on top of being a good hook to get you coming back next season, if the actor doesn't continue their contract with the show they can just give them a scene 1 sendoff. But once you see that dynamic, it makes a lot of shows annoyingly cyclic. I believe Stargate SG-1 was big on this. And I've been watching Shameless and just notice this happened at the end of the first season with a few characters. | Wait, dumpster fakeout? Can you remind me? | Jumped the ü¶à moment. | I started watching Daryl Dixon (because it's on Netflix) and it's just kinda boring. I wouldn't say it's necessarily bad, just nothing new or interesting seems to happen. | I think all characters are killable‚Äîgiven the right circumstance (poor Sean Bean). But like you said, the set up was terrible. Everyone‚Äôs favorite character on a show where favorite characters were starting to dwindle. No storylines intriguing enough to hold people‚Äôs attention instead. And then wholly inadequate fallout for the size and scope of what they‚Äôd just done. I think they were trying to stay comic-accurate but had nooooo idea how to do it with *this* Glenn. | Glenn was killed the same way in the comics. I would have been mad if they *didnt* have the balls to do it. The two things that killed my interest in the show were: the cliffhanger of Glenn‚Äôs death and killing Carl off | But true to the comic unfortunately. | Then it was poorly written in the comic too. The fake out and eventual death felt so cheap and gimmicky.¬† | Any criticism of this show (Glenn's death, Negan) is met with this retort.

We know. | Lost is a top tier show and I will die on that hill. I watched that show live every week from the very first episode up through the finale and at the time, was disappointed by the ending. However, I rewatched the entire series again on Netflix or whichever streaming service it was on at the time and that show still holds up and is honestly maybe better not having to wait a week between episodes and a year between seasons.

It‚Äôs not perfect of course, and I wouldn‚Äôt put it on the same level as Breaking Bad or any other shows like that, but if you go into a rewatch knowing that the show won‚Äôt answer every single mystery they introduce, you do come away with a much bigger appreciation for the show. Plus it‚Äôs nice to see a show from the early 2000‚Äôs that still holds up today given how much more focus, attention, and money has been put into television since the days of Lost | He fulfilled his Dad's desire to just end it all. | No, they‚Äôre supposed to be in Canada in the last couple episodes. It‚Äôs referencing the ‚ÄúVineland‚Äù legends when the Vikings actually landed in Newfoundland. Time frame is off by a few hundred years though. | I‚Äôve read every single one, and they were indeed amazing. There‚Äôs even a new culinary book co-written by Cornwell called Uhtred‚Äôs Feast that delves into the foods of the period interspersed with short stories, which is also excellent. | I liked the first few seasons, but it became formulaic. Ulthred is trying to recapture Castle MacGuffin, but gets bound by some oath to do something else. Resolves the oath by the end of the season, but in the final episode gets bound by a new oath, repeat. | I loved them all but I'm still confused as to what the deal with mouse was. | Second this. One of the best shows I've ever watched. The naval battles are gorgeous | I really appreciate the recommendation, I‚Äôll check it out! | I‚Äôll admit that it wasn‚Äôt perfect, but I‚Äôm not sure the casual viewer unfamiliar with the history of the period will even know that there‚Äôs such a long timeline. When watched without regard for the dates of the actual historical events it works. | Nah, I like Vikings for the dynamic between Ragnar and King Ecgbert. I saw that first. Then I saw TLK and it was just magnificent all around. | Her story arc is one of the best examples of a well-written female character that I‚Äôve ever seen, and Butterworth utterly nails the role. Aelswith is truly portrayed as a three-dimensional and deeply complex woman whose growth throughout the series is an absolute joy to watch.¬† | You complaining about reddit on reddit? | The idea of the Kromaggs was neat - I love me some alternate hominids.   Execution sucked. | That's kinda what I was saying, maybe I didn't make it clear. Original actors would be in like one episode at the start and maybe one other. But otherwise it would be new actors | Rudy is the main reason to finish the show | He was also terrific in Preacher. | Brassic is an incredible and surprisingly heartfelt show considering the setting and characters. | Nathan was a gremlin üòÇ | Yeah I thought he was a great character. But Nathan was just a savage. 

There was an episode where some sort of posh/weird guy meets the rest of them and they are all just like wait till Nathan meets this guy and it‚Äôs hilarious. 

Rudy was a lot more loveable so I think the show lost its edge. | Except Ron Howard left the show a couple of years after the episode where Fonzie jumps the shark. | Who looks exactly the same today as he did back in the 90s | if i remember correctly>! he got married and had a kid and wanted a safer job that didn't put him at risk. in one of his last episodes (maybe his last?) an unsub tried to kill his wife.!< | Hated the reboot. Too dark, and too slow. Just not enjoyable at all. | Oh he was just in a play six months ago - IBSEN'S GHOST and is in talks for another. He also  may be doing a podcast with Jim Clemente, a producer on Criminal Minds. SOURCE for the latter: TG cameo. I hope he doesn't switch entirely to theater, because I'd struggle to see him perform, lack of $$$.

  
And he was in SHADOW WOLVES in 2019 - a movie so bad even I couldn't stomach it & I watched for Gibson. | He lives in my parents‚Äô neighbourhood and took a selfie with my mum at the local Wal-Mart. He‚Äôs spotted fairly regularly at the pool, as well. | they fired him in 2016, it hasn't even been 8 years since.

criminal minds ran for 4 seasons after his firing. | The intra-season pacing was so annoying. Doing a round robin between story lines was a horrible idea and they stuck stubbornly to it | You know it's based off the comics right? | The main show ended, but I think they started (or planned to start) 2 or 3 spinoff shows. Idk, I stopped watching after Carl | Thank you for writing this out, it seems like a very good summary for those of us who didnt read it nor continued watching the show. | THANK YOU!

I saw the ending of the main show with my wife and we are now rewatching from the beginning because I haven't seen the whole thing and knowing that Carl is gonna die (I knew this for a while anyways) makes me go WTF about killing him off. | I liked Abraham mostly because he was Sgt. Denver ‚ÄòBull‚Äô Randleman.

Never saw Carl die, his bite reveal is the one I was referring to. | Chandler had just bought a house near the filming location too, assuming his character would be there for a while like the comics. Then they surprised him with his character dying | Big agree! | I don't love carl and I stopped bc he died. It just baffled me and the show had already fallen off | To be fair, so do the comics. I watched the whole thing, including all spinoffs, and read the comics twice. But the start is decidedly better than the last quarter | I'm really disappointed with Season 7 & Season 8 because while I personally could see how Jeffrey Dean Morgan was putting 100% into his role as Negan, as a comic fan, I hated how the character felt more like an overly cartoonish villain compared to the original comic counterpart, which was basically still ruthless as fuck, but actually reasonable & having some morals he wouldn't cross. | TWD definitely had a high viewership from very early on tho. Even in Germany everyone talked about it when S3 was new. | And they started doing more bottle episodes and focused too much on side characters no one cared about instead of moving the main plot forward. | I think a lot of people felt like that. The first showing had his eyeball hanging out while trying to talk to Maggie and they dialed it back for later showings. No idea what version they are showing now on streaming. | He was at boarding school with Clarkson so they go back a long long way. 

They were the Lennon/McCartney of motoring. | You just know the end of the episode is gonna make everyone cry. | Yeah they address that later on. Too scripted. | Now with grand tour ending for those three they have new presenters coming in too. I expect that to do a top gear. | Also really informative to see what farmers dealt with during covid in the first season as well as things caused by Brexit. As well as general infrastructure. | Hell you don't even have to like Top Gear. If you want to see what happens when a clueless brit with more money than sense tries to grow crops and handle livestock with no previous experience or even basic knowledge of any of it this show is for you. 

The side characters ""impatient guy that knows what he's doing and gives Clarkson shit whenever he has a chance"" and ""country old guy with important knowledge but also has an intelligible accent"" are just a bonus. | Yup, turns out I don't love cars, I mostly just love Jeremy Clarkson. | Funny, wholesome, and I'll add very informative. Gives a good glimpse into what really goes into farming. Now I know I'm glad i'm not a farmer! | I can't stand him but I like the farming show. Former farmer here. | Jeremy Clarkson attempting basically anything is top tier television | Ditto *Country Calendar* in NZ. Been going since 1966. They did a few brilliant spoofs earlier on too (radio controlled sheep dog, musical fence). | He's kind of a right wing twat. Even Hammond and May are like ""yeah we know he's sort of a prick, but he's our prick"".

He also has a very large audience and it's disappointing when he's being a prick because it has real world consequences. He basically told tens or hundreds of millions of boys and men around the world that caring about the environment or driving an electric car makes you gay and real men drive the loudest, fastest, most gas guzzling cars they can get.

And there is the fact that he got fired for punching a member of his production team in the face because they hadn't prepared a hot meal for him. You've obviously got to be a piece of shit to do that. | Iirc, that‚Äôs only the beginning. He actually has to run the farm, he can‚Äôt afford too many stupid things. And he does learn eventually. | TG was the most popular TV show worldwide - you didn‚Äôt have to be into cars or be European to ‚Äòget‚Äô it or like it. The show was never really about cars. It was a comedy show about three buffoons that had broad appeal no matter your cultural background

When they left, TG became ‚Äòjust a car show‚Äô, and that broad appeal was gone. | Did you watch the Grand Tour? | Top Gear used to be the most popular TV show on the torrent sites. It had a worldwide audience. | No ones arguing that - doesn‚Äôt mean the show carried on in any chance of its former glory. 

Plus, TBH. I think it‚Äôs a net positive. I didn‚Äôt enjoy The Grand Tour much since sometimes it just got a bit too silly. But Clarksons Farm and Richard Hammond Workshop are awesome and it don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd have them if they didn‚Äôt leave. So silver linings and all that. | I don't think it's a matter of opinion, you're just right - he absolutely had to leave due to his conduct. Physically assaulting a colleague like that should be a sacking offence in any workplace, regardless of circumstances. 

And frustratingly, it's also true that the show was simply not the same without him. Hammond and May knew they couldn't carry it themselves, and (sensibly, imo) decided to leave at the same time. The BBC kept trying to find another lineup that worked, but it was never going to be anywhere near as good.

Actually kind of upsetting that they kept flogging it as long as they did, and only pulled the plug after a(nother) life threatening injury on set. | Yeah, I remember a couple of months before the punching he had caused some other problem, and he was kept on with the public announcement that he was on his ""absolute final warning"" or similar wording. So yeah, even if assaulting a colleague wasn't a sackable offense anyway, he completely screwed himself.

He's an absolutely fascinating character, because on the one hand he's a very funny, charismatic and surprisingly intelligent man. Importantly, he's also extremely knowledgeable about cars, which did actually matter a lot.

However, on the other hand, he's also a massive prick, with an angry streak, a series of shit opinions and a lot of arrogance to him. | Yeah, but who hasn't wanted to punch Piers Morgan? | RIP Top Gear. | One punch is not ‚Äúbeating the shit out of a show staffer‚Äù there is also a story behind the incident. 

He is a different breed from a different era and snowflakes would always be his downfall. 

I didn‚Äôt agree with everything he said or did, but he is an artist in what he does and that wouldn‚Äôt keep everyone happy of course. 

I don‚Äôt care if this is an unpopular opinion. 

Their leaving was the downfall of TG | Leblanc was clearly acting as a car show presenter. I think if he had relaxed down, delivered the lines without trying so hard, and just shared his love of cars with the audience it would have been better. As it was, he just came across as a third-rate cosplayer. | [*NCIS: Tony and Ziva*](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/ncis-tony-and-ziva-begins-filming-1235948442/) will be on Paramount+ next year some time. No word if they plan to tie into the flagship, but it basically picks up with the couple in Europe running a security company, raising their kid.   

They're also doing a prequel (NCIS: Origins) that delves into Gibbs' start at NIS (before NCIS) in the early '90s. We get to meet the oft-mentioned Mike Franks. It's basically just before Gibbs and Dinozzo debuted in the NCIS backdoor pilot on JAG (which is finally fully available (all episodes) on FreeVee). | It's about 'Omelander bollocksing me wife | Two and a Half Boys | The crossover we never knew we needed | Oh okay, so spite. To be fair to Sheen though, he was right. | >I shudder

Do you have to make your way to the fainting couch before you succumb? | don‚Äôt you mean ‚ú®üóëÔ∏è‚ú® | Sounds like someone needs to calm down | >definitely don‚Äôt tell me what to do

Ooh watch out we got a badass over here lol | Sounds like someone has a case of the mondays | Calm down | I hate to tell you, it‚Äôs not true. He wanted them to write him off so he could comeback here and there. The show runners instead kill off his character. He was sad about it | What I remember about the Med School episodes was how eerily accurate it was.  My wife is a PA and at the time was in grad school.  Her class was taking the same courses as the rest of the med school for a while until they split off on their own track.  

There were Scrubs ""Med School"" episodes  that were nearly verbatim conversations  I was having with my wife when she talked about classes.  Especially the whole cadaver memorial episode. | They called it Scrubs Med School, but advertised it more as just a continuation of Scrubs. | It aired on regular television but I think they did some mini-episodes that were used as a web series. It's been years so I could be wrong about the mini episodes, but I watched season 9 on TV, I know that for sure. | No, the creator wanted it to be a spinoff, but the executives wanted to market it as season 9. | ""sometimes you call me ruxin and sometimes you call me ruspin, what do you think my name is?

ruspin ruxin, but all of your friends call you ruxin"" | Hehehe, can I get a SCOTCH! | He joined the cast for a live streamed reading of the scene during the pandemic and played Walton Goggins' character. | This is an uncharitable spin on the situation. Dan was not forced out for sexual harassment, that controversy was completely separate. Dan immediately took public responsibility once writer Megan Ganz came out publically about him pestering and holding her rejection of him over her while in a position of power. He then issued what has been called a masterclass in sincere apologies, which Ganz promptly accepted.

He definitely was guilty of scumbag behavior, but its not beneficial to anyone to hyperbolize and omit important details. | I did not know that happened on the community set. I also haven't read anything for a long time about community | Who is the other fat dude who is always hanging around Brian Posehn? Those two make a great combo, like nerdier versions of Tim & Eric. | Really? I hate that episode. I skip it on rewatches. | I think most people rank 5 over 6 | >Jonathan Banks

IIRC, his character was killed off. | I didn't know about this, but I remember at the time Abbie was seemingly being turned into a side character with the whole Crane family drama storyline, and Nicole was (rightly) pissed and wanted out. I felt like the showrunners fell into the same trap as *Castle* of thinking the show was being carried by one of the two leads, when it was really the chemistry between them that made it engaging. | I mean they didn‚Äôt go ‚Äúyou know what would be cool?  We should kill her off‚Äù. She said ‚Äúfuck this show I‚Äôm OUT‚Äù so they had to write her off by killing her. | He comes back for a few episodes in the final season and even directed and episode | He came back for part of the final season and it was a big improvement over season 8¬† | Your opinion is bad and you should feel bad. | And we got the iconic line ‚ÄúI wish there was a way to know you‚Äôre in the good old days before you‚Äôve actually left them.‚Äù | Yeah, season 5 finale playing volleyball at the company picnic | Actually, it‚Äôs pronounced espresso. | Yup. I'm a stooge. I expect many more comments pointing this out. As they should. | Good call, should have been clearer | Oh yes I only knew of Jim and Pam‚Äôs wedding, I didn‚Äôt know Dwight had a wedding | For the differing perspective, I think seasons 2 and 3 of the office are the greatest seasons of American comedy ever produced and 4 is extremely good. The show started showing cracks as early as some season 4 plotlines and was a completely different show in parts of season 5, beginning to lose touch of its roots in what made the show enjoyable in favor of doing typical sitcom style jokes.by season 6 there are funny episodes and scenes, but it's a fundamentally different show and a mediocre one at best.

Jim and Pam's wedding is a perfect example. The office is the kind of show in its early seasons that would have stayed as far away as possible from the dumb wedding dance song walk in thing, or even directly mocked it. It's played completely straight here. It's the exact opposite of what the show was. | I honestly get annoyed with everyone acting like the show is somehow trash without Michael. It goes from most episodes being an 8.5-10 for me to most episodes being a 7-9 for me. 

Like yeah, it obviously loses something, but still a great show with awesome moments. 

People acting like it is unwatchable or something are crazy. | This is technically right, because if the show focuses on wrapping up by the end of S7 there would've been a lot less fluff. 

But at the same time, the show peaked early with S2/3, even by S5 the show got a little of the rails. It was never going to stay as peak as it was early on. | My brother agrees with you. | I think I read somewhere that the actor who played Andy had taken on another role somewhere else and the producers? were not happy with him and this was their revenge. I could be totally wrong but... | I think I read somewhere that the actor who played Andy had taken on another role somewhere else and the producers? were not happy with him and this was their revenge. I could be totally wrong but... | Yeah was going to say his interactions with Jim early on show this pretty clearly. | But that's realistic- kids dealing with those issues frequently turn into adults who continue the cycle. They began acting like their parents. Deep down they don't feel like they deserve success, and they were never taught the tools to successfully navigate their lives. 

The show is called Shameless after all. 

That being said I agree about Debbie- her decision making and attitude about it definitely ruined the show for me too. | Yep. I actually still enjoyed the show after Fiona but Debbie became such a piece of shit I found myself angry after any episode that focused on her at all. Just absolutely trashed an otherwise decent character and turned her into the worst person on the entire show, in every sense. Fuck it still makes me mad to think about it. | Sucked kinda like... her father? | I‚Äôm pretty sure Lip became a chef and took over a sandwich shop‚Ä¶. | It is VERY realistic that he could not get out. It's very sad and common for bright, poor children to just flame out.  They really needed the support starting in grade 1.  

And Debbie getting pregnant on purpose is also a real poverty problem.  Little girls wanting to be grown up and with nothing good on the horizon they think being a mother is the next thing to do. | People got a justice boner watching him brutalize Ron the Rapist. It just wouldn‚Äôt provide the same satisfaction watching him brutalize a strung-out John the Junkie. | WHAT. I haven‚Äôt seen Runaway Bride in many, many years but I did watch it probably 30 times. I do not remember Meloni being it at all. | Oh yeah, I like both versions a lot. I think the show makes much better use of side characters, making it an ensemble cast. Whereas the books you're mostly trapped viewing everything through Quentin's eyes. And I love how that plays into his character growth as we see how self absorbed and oblivious he is early on. He fails to realize how much Josh is struggling. He fails to see how much he was making Penny feel ostracized. He's always so miserable despite most other characters generally viewing him positively or with envy for what he has. I think both mediums played to their strengths really well. | The books can't sing like Hale Appleman..I haven'r read the books though, so maybe they can. | The books are light years apart in tone. Be warned, the books are not happy ones. | Yeah! Just know they're very different and don't try to experience them the same way | Maybe? I read them at a time when I could really relate to a lot of the characters which I'm sure increased my enjoyment of them. I think the first book is good, the second is the best, and the third is somewhere in-between. 

The biggest change is probably how much the books focus on Quentin. He shares book two with Julia, but otherwise it's very much all about him. And he is quite unlikeable for a long time. Which is the point, and makes his character arc really great, but I know some people who just disliked him too much to keep reading. 

As someone who read the books first, it really helps to imagine the two stories as alternate timelines rather than adaptations of the same story. Which I think the show kind of suggests might be canon a few times? Either way, I'd recommend reading them or listening to the audiobook which has a phenomenal narrator if you liked the show. | Margo and Eliot are seriously two of my favorite characters of all-time. I don't need or even want a spin-off of *The Magicians*, but I'd absolutely love to see Summer Bishil and Hale Appleman in a show or movie together again. | I always respected the physics and equations in the show being real and checked by onsite consultants. | Oddly enough the worst part about Young Sheldon was when the story was about Sheldon.

I'm so glad they're doing a Georgie show, what a great character his brother is. | Young Sheldon is actually a pretty good show.¬† Solid story lines and when they do ""scientist dumb"", it's usually ""child ignorant of thing children actually ignorany of"" and it just works better.¬†¬†


The big bang theory, 90% of the jokes are ""scientist has a girlfriend"" or ""scientist weird"" or even ""scientist dumb"" or ""girl likes boy stuff"".¬†¬† | I just didn't find it funny.  The jokes were flat and devoid of humor.  If you listen to them without the laugh track it's incredibly obvious just how bad the jokes really are, since you don't have that canned laughter to tell you when something is being funny. | ...and it had Penny's nips every episode. | The only thing insulting about the show is that we're expected to laugh at its jokes. | Bazinga! | Which in itself is funny because reddit goes fucking nuts for Rick and Morty which has a lot of the same ""I'm so much smarter than you"" humor even though it's all so dumb everyone understands the joke. | I think it's because they can relate to it a little too much.

Personally, I liked it. | Feminists and those people who hated nerds in school hate it. | Sorry for your loss, my mom marathons the show a lot as background noise and makes the same comments. When I was younger it used to annoy me, but now I really appreciate that it's her way of trying to relate to me. | I mean, it only ran for like ten years, made a billion dollars, and was one of the top ten most watched TV shows during it's run, so yeah, I guess everyone hated it. | Internet people are real people.¬† | I‚Äôm with you, don‚Äôt worry. | My ex LOVED it. I had to watch a lot of it. 

I know people pick on the science/nerdy stuff but that didn‚Äôt bother me. Sheldon was such an unrepentant asshole that no one would ever put up with and he stated that way for 12 years. They ended up giving him a Nobel fucking prize and they gave one in physics to a neurobiologist which doesn‚Äôt even begin to make sense (maybe the nerd stuff did bother me‚Ä¶). 

It is the most cynically written show where no one seems to even be able to tolerate each other as friends, much less spouses.  And it went on FOREVER and absolutely would have continued if Jim Parsons hadn‚Äôt called it. | Glad I'm not the only one who noticed this. I have to assume they meant multi-cam. | yea it gets worse, way worse. at first i was laughing along with it, the usual jew being cheap and indians being dirty and poor jokes whatever everyone makes it. and then it just got so racist and passive aggressive, they pretty much became associated exclusively with the characters that were being clowned on. And the way that Raj has to talk too, guy's kind of a dick to represent his own people like that ngl | Moved across the country with two four year olds in a van back in 2007. Brought twenty DVDs. They would only watch Calliou. I‚Äôve never been the same. | I‚Äôve heard so many version of the story now from different perspectives. | Reading that, his voice immediately popped into my head for that line | Yeah, that‚Äôs the ticket. | Yes thats right. I remember the episode, but couldn't remember the name. I couldn't believe they actually killed her. | Yeah, I know. My question was more of a rhetorical ""why does it have to be this way"" general sort of whining.  lol | Absolutely. I loved Proctor and I loved Julio! I was sad when they killed him off. | Just my opinion but the main story line through Season 5 was great. But that was the originally planned story and when they decided to continue making further episodes the main plots really fell off. | There was possibly a sister and maybe aliens? A blur indeed. | If only I had Gillian Anderson's email address!  Or, you know, a time machine. | ""You know what they call a Quarter Pounder in France?""

""We're not doing this Mulder. Just be quiet.""

Last line of the episode:

""So... what *do* they call a Quarter Pounder in France?"" | I'm imagining it to have a vibe like Jimmy and Bunk in ""The Wire"", where they spend 10 minutes checking a crime scene, and the only words spoken are various ""fuck.  fuuuuck.  Fuck!"" | Thanks!  And yeah, that's one of my favorites as well | You know deep in your heart that if we had gotten it that it would've been really dimly lit | Thanks for the affirmation, friend | I'm with you 100%.  The point of all the stuff that happens on the show is that it happens to Mulder and Scully, and we want to see how they react and how it changes them. | Thanks! | The really campy episodes are the best IMO. The ones where Mulder and Scully actually smile and make light hearted banter. | He's still doing standup. He has a podcast but it's on break at the moment. | He still does clubs and theatre tours. He just filmed a special in Milwaukee a few months back, so I would expect it to drop soon. Also a podcast called the Jeselnik and Rosenthal Vanity Project, which just came back last week after a few months hiatus. On the pod he talks openly about how long it takes him to come up with a full hour of new material. His jokes are short, setup-punchline style so it takes him a long time to build an hour, then he tours with it until it's perfect, then films the special. He's not one of the guys cranking out an hour of mediocre standup every six months. | He‚Äôs done a few stand up tv specials, does a podcast. He‚Äôs had a couple of tv shows - one famously cancelled, another fizzled out. Plays the arrogant asshole so well, even does on socials as well. | He was diagnosed with Parkinson‚Äôs which limits his in person roles. | I'm so goddamn mad that I didn't put together that Jason Ritter was his son until just now | I love reddit. What'd you do for the show?? You've got a dream job of mine, lol | u/BeanieCapCreations knows that.  You just interpreted what they wrote, incorrectly. | God I love a ""well ackshally"" that comes from the commenter not being able to read | That‚Äôs been done a million times before; it‚Äôs always ‚Äúweird‚Äù per se but is so common in Hollywood that it would have been just another show that did it. Hell, Marvel stopped even explaining their recasts 15 years ago in the MCU. Tackling the death head on in the manner they did is vastly less common. | Oh for sure but it's not like Spacey doesn't have lawyers as well and I doubt they'd let accusations alone break a contract. But I'm not a lawyer and definitely not his lawyer heh. | Sheen still got a $25M when he got fired. | What an awful day to know how to read. | This is a tough one. 'Probably' isnt guilt in terms of criminal penalties of course. But in the simple economics of showbiz that is enough.

But in actual truth we all know that Hollywood has plenty of people that will do all kinds of things if it meant being near their idols or if they think it will help them get ahead in the business. Like everywhere else.

Not an excuse or rationalization. But actors (and politicians or sports stars) make the news when shit like this is unfortunately everywhere. The human species sucks and tbh Earth would be much better off without it. | I think John olliver said this about all the sexual assault allegations against Trump and I'm writing this from memory but....

""if one person told you that your friend tom shits in his kitchen sink, then I would say they're crazy and there's no way my friend Tom shits in his kitchen sink..... But if 26 different and unrelated people all told me my friend Tom shits in his kitchen sink then...... Yeah Tom DEFINITELY is a sink shitter. "" | I really have to separate the artist from the art with him.  Mom enjoys the show, and he is my favorite character.  His actions are a shame in so many ways. | The Ranch really went downhill after Kutcher had to fire Masterson. J/k Never watched that show or met anyone who did. | Do you smell burnt toast by chance? | I guess stuff like this is hard to understand when your parents are related | What a weird comment. | From human being to human being, you have got to step away from things and take a deep self reflection as to who you want to be in this life. | why does Kamala's skin color matter or bother you so much to make a comment about it | Gross | Nyet. Bad comrade. No borscht for you!!! | That‚Äôs not how tax write offs work | If they already know they‚Äôre not going to release it, there‚Äôs no reason for them to finish making it. Yeah, they‚Äôd be able to write off a bigger loss by incurring higher production costs before cancellation, but they‚Äôd be better off not incurring that loss in the first place. | The only other exit that was somewhat unreasonable was Burke but that was somewhat understandable once the reason why came out lol | Animals ate Lexi's body but Alex gets a farm... | Comments like this are why I continue to brave reddit. | You seem fun! | Glenn gets caught in a huge crowd of walkers, you think he's dead for at least an episode (I forget how long they dragged it out), they then reveal he survived by hiding under a dumpster | Exact same two reasons for me. Knew it was coming, had mentally prepared for it, then they pull the cliffhanger move. So fucking dumb.


And Carl's death was the last episode I watched. | That shouldn‚Äôt mean anything at that point anymore, considering Rick‚Äôs hand and the entire existence of Daryl | Of course there‚Äôs a cook book. | Love the show but yeah üòÇ the guy got destroyed by Oaths 

Was frustrating.  Like he is SO loyal, why must they keep fucking him over lmao | Even to a casual viewer its obvious. Characters go from being babies to full grown kings (meaning min 15-20 years) in just a few episodes and everyone else looks the exact same. | He was a trainwreck of a person and we love him for it | Yea was going to say, Richie is in that episode | The show's quality decline started when Fonzie jumped the shark on water skis. Basically, they couldn't top that and it's where the show should've ended but they dragged it out for several more years. They did have successful spinoffs like Mork and Mindy and Joanie Loves Chachi, so many modern shows use that as a template (Big Bang Theory, for example). | That's wild. | Fair enough. He still cost himself a lot of money. | These are the ones I am aware of at least. I haven't seen most of them. There could be more.

Fear the Walking Dead    
The World Beyond    
Daryl Dixon    
The Ones Who Live    
Dead City    
Tales from the Walking Dead | Oh yeah I forgot about that. | I kinda figured. I know by the final season of the main series, I was just wanting it to end. It was a shell of its former self by that point. Too many good characters were gone and it just didn't appeal to anyone. It got to be like GOT where it was ""who can we kill this week!?"" | There never felt like an end game,

After 8 years Rick was doing the same shit as he was doing in season 2 and we wanted the story to wrap up | For sure, I think around the season 4-7 mark it was at like‚Ä¶ 18 million peek viewers | The ‚Äútoo scripted‚Äù episode was so hilarious. 

‚ÄúSo here we are‚Ä¶ with amazing cars‚Ä¶ it sure would be cool if there was a track somewhere where we could put them through their paces. But I guess that would be too scripted‚Ä¶‚Äù | that speed down the pitch black tunnel that james may crashed really bad in was the stupidest thing i've seen them do. and they've done a lot of stupid stuff. | This is true. I‚Äôm an American whose approach to most cars (save some more unusual ones) is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care, as long as it works and gets me where I‚Äôm going.‚Äù And I loved the show , largely because of how the hosts played off of each other (and my love of the UK). | Initially when they left, it was hosted by Chris Evans (the British TV and radio presenter not Captain America).  God was he insufferable.   Jumping up and down shouting ""We got The Stig, we got The Stig"".  As though The Stig wanted to go with the other three but the lawyers said he had to stay with the BBC. | I think you meant ‚ÄúTG was the most popular TV show‚Ä¶..in the worrrrrrrrld‚Äù | I always explain to people that it's equal parts of cars, comedy, and kickass cinematography - then later on it became a travel show as well. | How was Top gear the most popular tv show? I‚Äôve never seen it but it‚Äôs literally a show about cars, except now you‚Äôre claiming it‚Äôs not? | Clarkson's Farm is genuinely a great show, and I feel like it actually kind of gets into Jeremy's heartstrings. It seems like that show was as healing for him as it was for myself. | May's Oh Cook! is pretty good too, and ""Our man in..."" | Don't forget James May's evolution into a semi-ironic food youtuber | Don't forget James May's ""Oh Cook!"" and ""Our man in..."" shows.  Both are great.  ""Hey, Bim!"" | Actually a lot of people at the time were certainly arguing he shouldn't have been fired. I suspect a lot of those people are still saying that. Idiots don't stop being idiots. | I wouldn't be surprised if they had to keep going for contractual reasons. Like if the BBC commissioned the show for 3 more seasons, and throwing away two more seasons would be unacceptable. 

Plus there has to be a non-zero number of people who thought that the cheeky-chappie car show format was what people loved rather than being a vehicle for three blokes to be on the screen. | So a somewhat smarter than usual Boomer? | Oh, that twat become so increasingly punchable every day that whoever beats him senseless will likely be knighted.

But he assaulted a crew member because the hotel he was staying in had closed the kitchen before he could order something to eat and he got pissed that he wasn't able to get any steak. | So it‚Äôs ‚Äôsnowflakes‚Äô fault he punched someone and got fired ? | There might be a story behind the incident. You don't know it though. All you know is that Jeremy can't be guilty because you think he's a top bloke.

You punch someone in the face at your job and you're getting fired. That's simple.

it's even worse that it wasn't really one of his ""colleagues"" like Hammond or may, it was just a guy working behind the scenes who is undeniably ""beneath"" Jeremy in the hierarchy. It was an arrogant star with an anger issue abusing a ""nobody"" because he thought he could get away with it.

Everyone knows he's a prick. Even Hammond and May know he is a prick. | We've met Mike Franks before. He was in a handful of episodes, usually toward the end of each season. | Mike Franks used to be in NCIS a lot. He hasn‚Äôt been for a while now, but it‚Äôs hardly the first time we‚Äôll meet him. | Al, I picked up yer chubby li'l prick son from footie practice. You're welcome. | I could see Starlight in place of Berta because of her DGAF attitude | [removed] | I'll be over here with the picnic chair | [removed] | The show entirely was really great about accuracy. It's much more accurate than many of the SERIOUS medical shows despite being mostly comedy. No surprise the trend continued into the 9th season. | I checked and you're right: it aired on ABC. Also, didn't get a title change because while the show runner wanted to call it ""Scrubs: Med"" to differentiate it the studio didn't want to so he just kind of threw ""Med School"" by the chest X-ray in the opening and hoped people treated it like a spin-off. | That apology was so self hating | It‚Äôs Steve Agee | That is such a new beanz thing to do! | üçéthis is for you, new beanz | Yeah but they still killed her off, like the OG comment stated | You‚Äôre right, Big Bang Theory just sucks in general | Sorry, I just assumed you'd pronounce it wrong. | Nexpresto | Still shocking to think about, I know. | I think there is something to be said about the in universe relationships. I believe if there wasn't such a scheduling conflict between The Office, The Hangover, and Ed Helms the show would have sustained much better. At the very least we owed Dwight his wedding and I'm glad we got to see that and his relationship with everyone in the office improve. | I think it's unwatchable well before season 8 actually! | It was The Hangover 3, which he was probably contractually obligated to do, but I think he was on the Office first? So that might be why. | except basically nothing about the show was realistic, so claiming it made sense because of realism is silly.

its a TV show, its meant to be ***entertaining***, yes a touch of realism is important. But following realism to the point of it becoming uninteresting is still a fault and a mistake.

the characters became irredeemable and frustrating to watch. They went from doing bad things to get by, to being truly awful people sabotaging not just themselves but leaving a trail of ruin in their wake, and once you don't have anyone in a show to root for anymore......ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è | True! Proud of him! | To be clear, I come from poverty and can confirm everything you‚Äôre saying. Both of these things have happened to very good friends and family members.

ETA: I guess I added the ‚Äòfairly‚Äô qualifier just because I don‚Äôt remember the exact details of how that storyline played out. | He's Coach Bob Kelly! I mean, following the rom-com formula you know he's meant to be snubbed and forgotten, but he played the role so well | Thanks for the warning. I can see how that might come to be though. | George Jr. is GOAT. | Perfectly acceptable - comedy is subjective! | Are those the jokes in big bang theory or is it ""what are you doing Friday?""
""Dungeons and dragons""
*Laughtrack* | I like R&M but not BBT ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

With R&M it's ridiculous scenarios and goofy characters. I don't think the jokes are particularly smart, a lot of it just parodies science Fiction in a fun way. 

BBT is just nerds being horrible to each other and trying to be funny. Idk, never clicked for me | But usually with worse taste | It hurts my soul that I had so many (non-sciency) friends who LOVED the show. The laugh track alone was an affront to humanity.... | Don't forget the mysoginistic, abussive of the male characters. | Frankly I'm glad I didn't continue watching it considering it got worse. Like I've said some racist jokes over the years like How do you start an Ethiopian rave party?, Put a peice of toast on the ceiling.¬†But that was rare and I unlearned that behavior.¬†


The episode I started watching was where Sheldon was at a dorm and ether a student or an ra was talking to him. I noped out when he did a ""you speak English really well"" (cue laugh track) line even though it was very apparent that the native language of the dude was English.


I was like, if this is what it's going to be like I'm not for it.¬† | Mmmmmm, jeeealous? | It's a shame, yeah. It would be great if *quality* of any given materials == *support* given to said materials. But FFS, the SciFi channel got absolutely **butchered** at around that time. Wrestling, ghost hunting, and reality TV shows. I remember when the channel supported their shows, even going so far as to flip what side the little planet logo was on so it didn't block the silhouettes during MST3K (adjusting logos, placements, size, etc is a *big legal deal* for companies). 

Instead, Bonnie Hammer didn't even bother to hide that the channel was successfully killed, and when any semblance of its science-fiction roots was in the past, she renamed it ""scyfy"". | She pops up on Reddit every now and then, so who knows... | ...her name is Bambi? | A man can dream | No problem. I love ambiguous story telling. I‚Äôm imagining a mostly static camera angle on the windshield of a car as they drive away from some indescribable horror. No flashbacks, just dialogue. | they just came back last week with a brand new JRVP, I think the break is over. | Didn't one of his shows get canceled because he made fun of some guy dying from a shark? | When was jeselnik diagnosed with Parkinson‚Äôs? | I‚Äôm his lawyer‚Äôs lawyer. | Famous Hollywood acting men in the same age group as Kevin Spacey have an average of less than 2 accusations from a life time in show biz.  Kevin Spacey is a huge anomaly.  I‚Äôm still finishing the work, but I did a study after the last time this conversation came up.  He is nowhere near the average of Hollywood men. | That‚Äôs why the 15 accusers against Spacey is so damning to me. Especially when he seems to have a specific pattern. | I read somewhere that you just gotta think that if Hyde met Danny Masterson he would beat the shit out of him and I think that‚Äôs true | The Ranch was one of those shows that could have been good, just somehow missed all the marks. I watched for a while waiting for it to find its cohesion and it just kept failing. | I‚Äôm experiencing second-hand cringe from reading it üò´ | Isn't that exactly what they did with Batgirl and Scoob movies? | Oh, thanks!

As a former huge fan of the show, I guess it‚Äôs pretty telling that I‚Äôm completely forgetting things like that. | oh for sure, and not just bcs of cm but it seems that he hasn't been swimming in roles since. | Except they hardly had to guts to properly kill anyone anymore. In the beginning it was great that they deviated from the comics character-wise, because you never knew who was going to get bit. But as the series progressed and they wrote out both Rick AND Carl, it was rather clear they'd just keep going with the fan favorites only. Rosita dying at the end might just as well not have happened to, it really felt purely like a ""well, someone still needs to die here"" kinda move. The only deaths I didn't see coming past season 4 were Jesus and the kid (Henry?), and only Jesus was actually saddening. | The show felt more like a prime time soap opera.  Seasons 1 and early season 2 felt way more cinematic.  Show went downhill once AMC canned Frank Darabont | Yeah I felt like the Savior War should've been wrapped up in 1 season & to close the show by season 8 while freshening up the story, I would've been cool with a final arc of the communities banding together to push for an expansion/offensive to attempt to fully boost a new society, even if it risks pissing off comic fans who wanted to see the Whisperers | The first few seasons of TWD envoke that ‚Äúhow are we gonna survive this‚Äù feeling. Still that I will do a rewatch around spooky season, but I usually stop after the prison. It‚Äôs a shame because I LOVED this show. But you‚Äôre right, the formula got repetitive. The group finds a safe place, puts down roots, someone threatens their safety, the tussle over it, then they have to leave. Wash rinse repeat for several more seasons. 

At one point there was an episode in I think season 8 where all they did was just walk through a swamp. I tried to push through to the end, but I honestly think I might have 4-5 episodes left in season 11 and I don‚Äôt really have a desire to power through them. | Lmao yeah. The ‚Äúnormally we send a scout ahead of us to find things but not this time‚Äù and they just drive around looking for stuff. | It got at its peak 350 million viewers per week in over 200 countries. It was and remains the most watched TV show of all time. 

It was technically a show about cars, but the point of it was to show off the comedic banter and nonsense the trio of Clarkson, May and Hammond got up to. The cars were just a vehicle (pun intended) for the comedy. | Yes! They were right for firing him and he was right to start a farm. Clarksons farm is such a wholesome series. We can see real personal development in Clarkson. Hope many more seasons are on their way | I loved ‚ÄúOur man in‚Ä¶‚Äù but just couldn‚Äôt get into his cooking show. | Bim. Guess what | I remember a lot of posts at the time saying that the BBC were just trying to get rid of him because he‚Äôs conservative. He‚Äôd been pissing people off for years and they had been brushing it off because the show was successful. They didn‚Äôt have to keep renewing the show. He left them no choice when he assaulted someone. | I don't think there would have been a contractual issue as it was produced by the BBC themselves and not a third party (like how Hat Trick do ""Have I got news for you""). | The guy was winding him up all day / week apparently. There was more to the story and ‚Äú Back in the day, you chat shit you get hit ‚Äú 

Didn‚Äôt the director lose his job and struggle to get employment after ? And the the team got an upgrade , kinda speaks volumes.

He had a history of offending people big time. 

I didn‚Äôt agree with it all but I agree with free speech. | They killed him at some point around season 8-12. | Definitely don‚Äôt tell me what to do | You‚Äôre right. They could also be a big bitch too. Gotta watch out for them. | Sounds like a trained navy seal with over a 100 confirmed kills xD | Lol try not to cut yourself on that edge | It's more accurate because it's a comedy. The actual medical stuff isn't the focus so they can afford to make it boring like real life. | Care to explain what you mean? | It's my birthday | I still use the phrase ‚Äúnew beanz‚Äù pretty regularly. Love that episode. | I should have worded my comment better I see what you mean. | Like I said. | Everyone ""improved"" EXCEPT Kelly | Why?  I think Dwight having a good relationship with everyone in the office is great for cheesy American sitcom wrap it up moments. It sucked for the office. it's the polar opposite of what made the show good. Any sense of realism of these characters was stripped away in favor of shooting people with tranquilizer darts and pushing them down stairs or magically dropping 50 IQ points between seasons. | Neat. | That does ring a bell so you are probably right! | You're right about the argument of realism and the show, but what I mean is that people need to act in a manner that allows a suspension of disbelief and at least trend in the direction of realistic actions/attitudes/behaviors but just amped up for dramatic effect. Which is what it did. 

I know people who act like that, who grew up like that, and most of them turn into their shitty parents. Most of them self sabotage and don't better themselves. 

Where it went wrong, and why it became irredeemable and frustrating to watch is because they went too far with the hyperbole and took away all their redeeming qualities. Humans are complicated beasts and there is usually some semblance of good peeking through here and there to illustrate the character's humanity and round them out. The show  removed that from the characters and it ruined it. People need to act in a way that makes sense in the world that is being built, which is what I mean by realistic. Thanks for debating with me. I'm interested in your thoughts about this too. | One show doesn't take itself seriously and the other does.  That's the difference between them.  R&M works because the writer's know they're over the top and ridiculous. | In your case, for sure. j/k, but basically everyone is on the Internet at this point, so there'll always be every viewpoint. | You're being downvoted because you used the wrong word.  ""Misogyny"" is the hatred of women, which the male cast very much does not.  Even Sheldon, but only because he treats *everyone* like a third class citizen.  Benevolent sexism is the phrase you're looking for, where the boys appear to be kind and considerate but underneath still view the girls as beneath them. | Buy my book!

  
Buy my book! | Yeah, I miss the days when the SciFi channel had actual sci-fi content. | u/gilliananderson Last post 9 years ago, but who knows indeed.

Edit:

u/kumailnanjiani Hey why not, loved your episode man | Nice | hah, yeah. he talks about that in his ""thoughts and prayers"" special. basically whenever someone was killed by a shark, it was shark party time and a bunch of girls came out in shark outfits and danced along to celebatory music. | I misunderstood, I was referring to Michael J Fox | ‚ÄúAn average of less than two‚Äù is a nonsense phrase. | He definitely would. Hyde was a good dude. Masterson is a piece of shit. | Yes but that was a different situation entirely. They were casualties in a corporate buyout. That isn't a normal situation. Basically the buying company didn't spend the money (the company they bought djd) but they get the tax write off since it's an asset. Basically right time right place | The only other thing I've seen him in was the short lived 90s sitcom ""Dharma and Greg."" | Shit, I forgot about Rosita. That happening was a ""wtf really?"" scene for me. I barely remembered Jesus though since I was mentally checking out by that point. Truly, the show could've ended the day that Rick left and everyone would have probably been okay with that. Michonne leaving later really put the nail in it. | That‚Äôs how I used to describe the show: a soap opera with zombies. | I still think running fear the walking dead into a whisperer origin story and then combining the series would have been the best approach | The whisperers was just a horrible idea in general. Not that the show is realistic, but that thought that people would want to live covered in zombie shit 24/7 and fight a relatively normal community rather than join them is just a no. | I think the show was best when they were on the road and doing world building. Show me dark stories, show me what different locations were doing. Don‚Äôt just stick in one location and going through the same loop | My favorite scene is when Gerald said ‚Äúdhrusnsjfiejsbfjfjshejfoaiwbtjvksj‚Äù | Lol his politics aren't nearly bad enough to get kicked off a show, suffice to say whoever saying that was being rather far fetched imo.


Him being a bit of a nightmare seems alot more reasonable | Free speech doesn‚Äôt equate to chinning someone. 

Free speech also means the guy winding him up can say what he likes, yes? | It been awhile since I had stopped watching. Last I remember him and Gibbs were down bbn in Mexico living g like Red and Andy at the end of Shawshank Redemption. | I was working around that in case anyone cared about a decade plus old NCIS spoiler but yes. | Oh my god I am just realizing that was a spot on Reddit take by the show. And the only reason I finally got it was because I thought ‚Äúyeah no one‚Äôs gonna downvote a guy on his birthday‚Ä¶‚Äù | If you feel that way. I choose to enjoy what we got. I appreciate Jim and Dwight's bromance. Jim learned to prank from his brothers, it was a sign of affection. Dwight is strict and to the point. Like you'd have to be on a farm in order to survive. He learned his unique ways from his family. Passing those lessons and traditions is a form of affection. I enjoy sad stories (The Mist, Never  Let Me Go, Rogue One) doesn't mean I can't enjoy the happy stories either. | I guess it is if you don‚Äôt understand math

The average nuclear family had 2.5 kids | Only if you don‚Äôt know what an average is | Yeah, Jesus dying was only impactful for me because I just really didn't see it coming at all. If it had happened earlier in the series (honestly by the time Jesus was introduced it was already too late), it could have been a very impactful scene. Short, unexpected, sudden, brutal. By the time it did happen, it just felt casual and lazy though. And if there was ever a forced character dead, it was Rosita's. Really like, well, we're not going to do a spin-off with her, so she might as well die now. | So my wife and I are doing a watch from the beginning (she's seen the show before) because recently she was finishing the last 2-3 seasons since she never finished them live. I casually would peek over and watch a bit with her so I saw the finale with her. What a weird decision. I remember saying ""why do that?""

We're at the end of season three with the prison and Governor (just saw Andrea held captive last night). Some of the deaths have been shocking, in a good way, and I know about Glenn just from reading and seeing stuff online over the years because I never got into TWD when it was live. I'm really enjoying these seasons but I can see how it's going to get repetitive if it's the same progression every season.

The first two seasons were incredible though. I get why the show got popular now. I was never a big zombies guy but after watching the pilot I was hooked. Very similar to Breaking Bad where the first episode immediately hooked me. | My favorite is when Kaleb was stressed out trying to follow the GPS through London traffic. | Maaaaybe but I'd say it's more social environments in general and some of the Facebook wishing people a happy bday on their wall. That episode aired 10 years ago (jesus christ) and while Reddit was in full swing then, it's WAY bigger now, [supposedly by a factor of 10x.](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/reddit-statistics/) | I don't know why you're talking about happy and sad stories when I never said anything of that nature. I'm talking about  the complete changing of the style of comedy on the show, and the complete abandonment of the type of show the cast and crew say they set out to make, as well as the character assassination of most of the characters throughout the later seasons.  You can write Dwight and Jim magically becoming best friends, it's just really really really stupid in the context of the actual show.  You can write Kevin being the dumbest person on earth, it's just really really really stupid if you remember he won a WSOP bracelet. You can write Stanley getting shot with tranquilizers and pushed down the stairs at work, it's just horrifically antithetical to the style of comedy on the first few seasons. | By the end, they could have killed everyone except for Maggie and Daryl. Maybe Negan? At that point, it just wasn't the same. Rosita's death was so anticlimactic too. Like ""we won! Oh no!"" and then they have a small goodbye. It was really a shit ending for Rosita considering how long she'd been in the show. Yes, I'm still salty. | ""I think Dwight having a **good** relationship with everyone in the office is great for **cheesy** American sitcom wrap it up moments.""

Emphasis mine. | I don't even agree on Maggie. She wasn't all that likable towards the end, with her stupid feud with Michonne for no good reason. Daryl would've upset people, but honestly I think that's exactly why he SHOULD have died. Not stupidly like Rosita, but with a big heroic gesture. I think he's the only last-episode-death that would've made sense and not felt too cheap. What with all the 'if Daryll dies we riot' stuff that went on for years, that would've been funny, to kill him in the finale. Negan to me is the only one that should've survived, because I was extremely hyped for his spin-off. Too bad it was the worst one. But I blame Maggie for that. | Yes. Dwight having a good relationship with Jim is impossibly stupid if you care about internal consistency within the show. This has nothing to do with loving happy or sad endings, it has to do with horrible writing.  Two people not being friends is not inherently sad.

Your emphasis doesn't make any sense.  You seem to have a parasocial relationship with these characters and keep replying with weird off topic remarks when I've been talking about the bad writing the whole time so don't think we're gonna get anywhere here. | I'm biased simply because I liked Maggie in an ""oh my, she's rather hot"" way. Yes, that's stupid, but oh well. Her character arc was good for awhile, but ran off the rails for me with her stupid feuds. It made sense feuding with Negan, but the rest was just to create drama and not very good drama either. Daryl would have been an interesting death so I would agree to that especially since he seemed built for that sort of world anyway. | If you say so. | Hey, fair enough, wouldn't be the first time I root for a character because they're hot. My friend that I watched the whole series with was always salivating over Rosita lol. I was mostly rooting for Tara because of the same reasons. That and Enid in her final season. She wasn't a very important character, but both of them dying at the same time was a bummer too. Good scene though, but I mean, it was the single most shocking scene in the comics, so if they'd fucked that up without a single expected death, that really would've been the end if me watching."
HR people of Reddit: What's the most NSFW/WTF reason someone got fired from your place of employment? ,"Sending and receiving child porn on the office network, including images of his own child. Hopefully still rotting in prison. | Someone where I worked had a manager fired for cheating on his wife with another employee. His wife also worked at the same company.

Edit: They were caught together at work on company property. | I'm not in HR but I once worked with a company were they had to fire some people because the CEO caught them having a gangbang in the office after a staff party. | Watching porn on his work computer while pleasuring himself in his office. With clear glass windows I'd like to add. | Clipping their toe nails in the production room. I work in pharmaceuticals üòê | My HR lady got fired for having an affair with someone within the company. They were using their company emails to write each other racey shit. | Someone I know had one of her bosses come to her and put a $100 bill on her desk and ask to see her ‚Äúlarge breasts that he had admired over the years.‚Äù 

They let the dude go. Instantly. No charges were filed but my friend was shaken because this is a man she had almost considered fatherly over the years. WILD | They thought there was 10 inches in a foot, and did a bunch of over-height trucking permits wrong (example: writing 13.6 feet at 13 feet 6 inches) and ended up delaying the shipment of a crane for a critical construction job which got the entire trucking company blacklisted. | Not HR, but I had someone fired for trying to poison me. Found out about it because she DREW PICTURES OF HERSELF DOING IT to me and people I know. There were other drawings of her stabbing me and ‚Äúputting me to sleep forever‚Äù and robbing me. 

The kicker? She signed and dated every drawing. I‚Äôd known this woman for 20 years prior. This was completely out of nowhere. | Guy was running a side business producing ""adult"" calendars. Got caught because our sysadmins noticed he was soaking up some ridiculous fraction of our bandwidth... he was downloading astronomical amounts of porn.

I fired him on the spot and had him escorted from the building. Then I instructed my secretary to clean out his desk and box up his belongings. She walks out of my office and over to his cubicle. Comes back to my office 30 seconds later and says, ""Nope."" | I had to let a guy go from a production line. This was in a small jerky plant, and most of the people on the hand pack line were women. I hired this guy, he presented not crazy like some others, and things were good for a week. The second week there, he didn't like that he couldn't sit until breaks, so started telling the ladies on the line that he knows how to kill and skin a human, and nobody would miss them in this small town. 

The women all rushed my office at break, and I had to call the police BEFORE I called him to the plant managers office. As soon as the offending guy walked in he said, ""I knew them bitches would say something.""

This plant is majority woman run. I looked at the plant manager, she nodded and I told him that we had to let him go due to the disturbing things he said, and that he is also trespassed from the plant grounds. The officer followed him out to his car, and that was the last we saw of the guy. He called 2 weeks later asking if he can drop off fundraiser items people bought before he was let go. I told him to leave them at the police station. The items were never dropped off. The people that gave to him were reimbursed by the plant owner.

It wrapped up nicely, but at the same time...what the hell? | This was back in 2014:

I worked at a call center in San Diego. A bunch of new temp hires just finished their mandatory 2 week training and was starting their first real day on the job. Mixed group of folks , one of them from was a roughly 24 year old man, who had no previous job experience. We sat in an open floor plan call center, meaning no cubicles, with people sitting next to you, behind you and in front of you. Well, a woman on the team who sat next to this guy asked management to move her, didn‚Äôt really explain why, other than she just wanted to be placed somewhere else. They moved her next to me and we quickly became work buddies. I leave shortly after as I had found better employment. Well, guess what, she calls me one morning cracking up because the guy was arrested at the job that morning. Literally like 10 minutes into his shift the police were there. Turns out IT been documenting the amount of porn he‚Äôs been watching on computers, downloaded gigs and even jerked off a couple times at work.

This was in 2016:

My father was like the guy in my previous story but he worked at a bank and it was cp. I don‚Äôt talk to him anymore.¬† | Had a coworker, we'll call him ""Larry"", and he's from an eastern European ex-superpower. Larry was a real piece of work, would come in with like chains, crazy bling rings and jewelry, pimp hat, the works. Well, one day I'm sick and when I come back the next day I hear someone had said something awfully misogynistic in the team group chat, but it's since been deleted. A few more days go by and as I'm walking to the bathroom, I run into Larry, who is wearing his general getup of ridiculous attire. I tell him ""Good Morning Larry"" and he responds with ""Hey Spiderbubble, fuck you!"". Realizing he's joking around, I tell him ""well your shoes look like shit"" (he's wearing one bright neon green sneaker and one bright neon pink sneaker, they did in fact look like shit).

A few days go by and I get called into HR for ""insulting a coworkers clothing"". Nothing came of that, but it was odd.

A month or so after this, Larry gets fired for reasons not publicly shared, but that evening we go to have drinks with a few coworkers, and someone had invited Larry. We get some drinks and I eventually get to talking to Larry. He admits that I got called into HR because he reported me to deflect, because that day he got called into HR for saying ""some shit in the group chat"". He then admits that this job was just whatever for him, because before he used to run a brothel out of an RV. He \*loves\* prostitutes, he tells me, and while we were working together, he would spend half his paycheck every month (one paycheck per two weeks, roughly $1500-2500) on a single night with a prostitute, because ""Look at me, I can get girls that are like a 6, but when you pay for it...."". Then he kept saying how much he would love to get with our Indian coworker, continuously calling her ""Vishnu"" (that was not her name, it wasn't close but did start with V). I asked him what he was going to do now that he's out of a job, to which he replied that ""well I can't stay at my apartment, I just got in a fistfight with my landlord"". After probing that story, turns out his landlord is a woman, a veteran, and he instigated the fight by punching her in the face. He also mentioned he couldn't go back to his home country, because he is a deserter from the army, as he joined and deserted shortly before taking this job in the US.

Not sure where Larry is now, but he was crazy. | I'm not in HR, but I used to work with a guy who was universally reviled. I'll call him Creepo, because he was incredibly creepy, with a dead stare and skin the queasy color of buttermilk. Most people at that job were some flavor of mentally ill and unfortunate looking, though, so I wasn't sure why he was so uniquely hated. One guy was fired for putting nails in his tires, which wasn't a very bright thing to do when there were cameras in the parking lot, but he turned out to be a vigilante hero. Creepo was a pedophile with reams of CP on his computer at home. He was also charged with assaulting a 13 year old girl. He's rotting in prison now. | Not HR: 

My first job was as a parking lot attendant. I was training a new hire in the easiest job since I had an appointment that day and had to leave for an hour or so. Upper management knew what was going on, lower management did not. I got back, saw I missed a call from work, and clocked on. 

Immediately the head cashier pulls me aside and asks me why I went AWOL and I explained myself. Luckily dodged a write up but the new hire was also AWOL. The store, a big store too, was completely out of carts. Then a customer interrupted us saying they couldn‚Äôt get into the parking lot.

The head cashier and I went outside: our new hire was attempting to bring in every. Single. Cart. All at once. This was not a store that had a motorized cart pusher, so he was doing it all by hand. He also managed to block the main entrance in doing so. 

Me: Uh wtf are you going?
Him: My job.
Me: By bringing in all of them at once?
Him: Well it seemed like a waste of time to do them one at a time.
Me: So why aren‚Äôt you doing loadouts?
Him: I saw the products, it didn‚Äôt seem like I was needed.
Me: But you don‚Äôt get to ask that.
Him: Well they should only call me for ‚Äúreal‚Äù loadouts. | Woman was providing blowjobs for cash over lunch breaks. The first word mentioned about her lunch breaks and she asked if she can just quit and leave immediately. We let her do that lol. | Boss kept finding women to hire in a male dominated field. Great! 

He kept trying to fuck them. Fired. | The ceo and the HR boss got caught fucking in the office, ended up with the HR lady getting the boot lol.¬† | Am HR person, and I could write a book on the topic but there are 2 that stick out in my mind. 

First was a case of sexual harassment where a male employee, standing next to another male employee, beckoned a female employee to come over to him by doing the come hither motion with his hand/finger. When she came over he said to her, at full volume, ""Wow if I can get you to come over here with one finger imagine what I could do with two.""

Second was a case where the only cash register at a location was stuck shut. One employee took it upon himself to take a hammer and beat the shit out of the register until it opened, breaking it, and then proceeded to take all the money out of it; all of this was on video by the way. When confronted with this his defense was ""I thought if I got it open I could keep the money"" despite no one saying anything remotely close to that. | Assistant Manager was saying the n-word and loves Hilter and told an underage associate about how she did cocaine the night before and got fisted by her bf. | Fired a guy for not showing up for 2 or 3 days straight, when he finally did like nothing happened I asked him what was up and he casually just said ""Oh, I accidentally took too much xanax and passed out for two days.""

Let another guy go after he failed to return from his weekend vacation I'd given him time off for. Not answering phone, no one knew where he was, I was worried and ended up calling his emergency contacts and it turns out he was in rehab, not on vacation. He was gone for like 2 weeks before I found out what was actually going on. Told him straight up if he had told me what was going on he'd have a job, but instead he has a lesson. RIP that dude. 

Buddy fired a gal who had worked at the place for 10+ years, for drinking all the vanilla extract. Gallons of it, for years. He was doing inventory (it was a popular breakfast place/bakery) and realized they went through about 500% more vanilla than they ever actually used, checked cameras, found her drinking it all day long. 

He fired another couple dudes for a scam they had been running for years themselves, two friends, one worked days, one worked nights. Day guy would click himself in in the AM, then instead of clocking himself out when he left, clock his buddy in. 2 hours later his buddy would show up for work, clock the first guy out instead of clocking himself in, and then clock himself out at close. They each got an extra 2 hours a day, every day, for like 5 years. 

Dunno who was running the place before he got there, but damn. 

I got an honorable mention, since this guy kept his job after I verified his ridiculous story. Dude shows up 7 hours late for his shift, saying he was *locked in a cave.* Turns out, he and a friend actually got locked in a cave and would have been there all night if one of the employees (tourist attraction cave system) hadn't come back to get something. | This is gonna be a youtube video, I can feel it. | CFO of a company I used to work for got To Catch a Predator'd meeting up with a ""13 year old"" at a hotel. He was a gross creep. | Not HR but we were sent a training video by our partner company we had a contract with on their new Instagram connection. The video was recorded by our account rep showing how to use the new features. In the video, she opened her iPhone pictures to upload one and in that flash on the screen all 9 recent photos from the phone were extremely graphic porn selfies. Toys, up close shots, etc. Had to report it, she was fired that day and were given a new account rep. IT had to scrub it off my computer. Thank god we hadn‚Äôt sent it out to our users yet. | Isn't anything you get fired for NSFW? | Obligatory not HR, but...

Some dude got fired for poor performance. He had just gotten a new laptop, which was on his desk, and happened to have his old laptop still, which was kind of junky and sitting at his house.

So dude got a woman he knew who still worked there to go to the office the next day, which was a Saturday, and swap his old laptop for his brand new laptop. 

The office building had security cameras in the lobby, and you had to scan to get on the elevators and at the main doors to our offices on our floors, so when IT went to secure the laptop on Monday, realized it was not the new laptop they were expecting, *remembered it being there on Friday* because they checked after firing the guy - well, it took 3 minutes to put everything together.

So numbnuts not only got himself fired with his shit performance, he also got his friend fired for stealing his laptop.

And yes, they made him give the laptop back. | Temporary associate whipped out his package and started beating it while looking at a female employee while standing on a catwalk above her in the middle of the work area.... Where we had very obvious cameras. | A guy I worked with was fired because he worked 3 full time jobs and it turned out he was sleeping for 6 hours on his shift.

This was on night shift at a Home Depot. He used supplies from the store to build himself a platform above the rug cutting machine and had a whole set up he slept in for almost a year until he was caught climbing in the machine on camera. 

We all just thought he was shitty at the job and wasn‚Äôt getting anything done. He is secretly my hero | a manager called the police on an employee 'refusing to leave' their shift & the police arrived & arrested manager for being hammered (She blew a .22). | I am not in HR but my female supervisor was fired for sexually assaulting me. Took advantage of me while we were all drunk at a staff party and forced me into her while I was intoxicated and passed out. | Work in a mill.

We've got these big buildings to store raw wood material in.

Early on during commissioning a guy was doing fire watch in one.

In full view of the cameras he decides to take a piss and gets witnessed by a bunch of the higher ups and promptly canned. (he had a radio and could have called for someone to cover easily)

Idiot. | He wasn‚Äôt fired but back in the day when wifi wasn‚Äôt so easily available and you had TPN when you travelled to get data this guy clocked up thousands of dollars while he was away for work. He had been gambling online and watching porn on his work laptop and using the company TPN to get internet access. 

He had to pay back months worth of money when they tracked his usage back and saw how many big bills he‚Äôd racked up. 

The most recent one had reached a thousand dollars which triggered the alarm. I guess he figured he was getting away with it and got braver. 

The guys wife had recently left him for his habits and he was paying child support and gambling so he was broke as hell and then ended up paying back our employer thousands of dollars.

He admitted he‚Äôd watched entire porn movies and spent hours per day on gambling sites hence the high usage. | QA Manager fired for rubbing one out in his car over lunch break; caught on surveillance video. Analytical Chemist Group Leader fired for calling one her staff a fat, lazy, n-word. HR Director fired for streaming Netflix all day long and her door was closed all day long. She was literally employee #3 at a company that ended up with 100‚Äôs and thought she was untouchable. IT Director fired for botching up a software changeover and crippling 95% of computers for days. Facilities engineer fired for banging logistics girl in the mezzanine. She was married to another guy that worked there. She kept her job, but not her marriage.

[EDIT] forgot to mention this all happened within 5 years at one company in NC | We had an office oddball in accounting that got caught violently beating off in the men‚Äôs room stall. It was not a private bathroom. Also, this was pre-smart phone, so it‚Äôs not like he was watching any kind of inspiration or anything. | Non-HR person here. I work in a union so you know there's gotta be a good reason for firing someone. 

Guy took voyeur videos from tanning salons in the surrounding counties, and used his work laptop to transfer these videos from one external device to another. | Guy jacked up the rear of his company car and ran it for hours.  His goal was to increase the milage to get the car replaced sooner.  Fired! | Oh hell yes, I actually have an answer to one of these.

I used to work at a magazine publishing company. I was pretty close friends with the editor of one of our health magazines. She was really good at her job and a kind person. I was absolutely floored when I came to work one day to learn that she was fired.

Turns out that in the dark recesses of our magazine library, she and one of the graphic designers were having full-blown intercourse. What makes matters worse is she was fired a day after a bunch of us just returned from a weekend, out of state, for HER WEDDING with another man.

She‚Äôs still married to that man and has a couple of kids now. I know he knows. But I haven‚Äôt been in contact with them for many years now outside of seeing the occasional social media post.

About 6 or 7 of us in the office went to the wedding, and boy, did we feel very conflicted about it afterwards once we learned why she was fired.

And fwiw, I didn‚Äôt know the graphic designer (who was also fired) very well. He was a quiet guy who did his job, I rarely conversed with him. 

In terms of how they were discovered, as far as I know, she was talking to other coworkers about what she was doing on our work messaging platform (similar to Slack but not Slack). I couldn‚Äôt believe how idiotic somebody could be to talk about something like that on a company channel! It‚Äôs like she wanted to be caught. | Oh this will be one of those ‚Äûnot the kind of person you asked for but‚Ä¶‚Äú posts | Two of our managers were fucking in a port-a-potty during a company charity event. | A supervisor drove an employee home, then stopped at a coffee shop where he got into a physical altercation with another direct report of his in the parking lot. On company time, using the company vehicle. | I got sexually harassed by a guy and they fired him. 

Someone walked in and found him forcing himself upon me outside the bathrooms and went straight to a manager because they could see that I was protesting and pushing him away. I was about 20 and he was late 30s. I had walked out of the ladies and he just grabbed me and pushed me up against the wall. This was after months of asking me on dates (even after I said I had a bf) and telling me daily how good I looked. I knew he was interested but I naively thought it was harmless and just brushed him off until this incident.

He stopped once he realised he‚Äôd been witnessed but she had gone straight to the boss and reported it and he was let go. | Dude got drunk at the holiday party.  Smashed a beer bottle over someone‚Äôs head‚Ä¶ | Not in HR but someone at my old job, well before I worked there, wasn't exactly fired as he was hauled off by the police/FBI for having CP. They had to confiscate his work computer because he hid it on their as well. | Had a girl yelling at me after I fired her husband. He was a manager at one of my stores. He told her we fired for without cause because we were losing money. I let her go on for several minutes, insulting the company, threatening to sue us and all that. Then I let her know he was fired for sexual harassment of a minor. A 17 year old asked him to get something off a shelf for her. He said ‚Äúonly if you suck my dick first‚Äù with four witnesses. 

A bit if realization set in her face, and she walked out without saying anything. She was maybe 24 years old. Her husband was 36. They had three kids. The oldest was maybe 6-7 years old. | Assembly line stopped working to have a Twerk-off. Six people fired for twerking for 20 minutes while a seventh judged the winner.

Maybe would have gotten away with it if they hadn't moved directly in view of a security camera.

They were surprised it was a fire able offense | Parts of the front office sleeping with other parts of the front office, including HR.  My favorite quote from the whole ordeal ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know who she was hired for sleeping with, but I know who she was fired for sleeping with.‚Äù  They fired the guy too, which is probably better than paying off the woman and keeping the guy like they had done previously.  I was not surprised when that place went out of business. | Security. Guard showed up for work at an apartment complex with a parrot in his shirt. Took the maintenance golf cart and drove around the site setting off all the fire alarms. He filed a claim after being fired that it was racially motivated as the owner was white. He was also white. He won. | She was having sex with her students. This was a high school teacher, but it later came out she was sleeping with middle school kids the year before. | It‚Äôs not exactly that this guy was fired, but instead he got a different job offer and announced his leave. 
So my previous employer, without mentioning anything confidential, is in a highly new field that is still very heavily being developed. Around the globe there are plenty of companies attempting to do the same but let‚Äôs say this field is definitely not yet at a mature level in terms of scientific and legal challenges but is quite competitive.
This guy in question, was always already very weird to deal with. Like the pale, socially awkward guy but did seem pretty intelligent. So then when announcing he was going to leave, he had his goodbye party at the company and everything. Still all normal up until this point. 

However, this guy then suddenly came in a day after his last official day with some excuses that he forgot something. Naturally, people were sort of confused about it. 
So then, our IT department discovered that this genius of a guy had downloaded tons of confidential files and documents all to his computer. What‚Äôs more, is that his new job was going to be a direct competitor in a different country. Obviously, when the company discovered they immediately pressed charges and the guy even admitted having done this. 

I am not even sure where this guy took the audacity from to do such a stupid act and hoping to remain undiscovered. I also truly wonder whether it‚Äôs the case that the other competitor pushed him into doing this, or whether he thought it‚Äôd make him come into his new company as a hero. 
Needless to say, he definitely didn‚Äôt get that new position and based on LinkedIn, it seemed like he didn‚Äôt get anything else for quite a while. At one point he appeared as an account manager at one of our main suppliers, but when we discovered his name, we very clearly stated of course that we had had extremely bad experiences with him and didn‚Äôt wish to have any business contact with him. So far on his LinkedIn his ‚Äúcurrent employment‚Äù is still the original company I was working at. This way like 2 years ago. So it seems like the guy was served some karma and damaged his career for quite some time to come. | The guy I replaced at my current job was fired for soliciting an ""underage prostitute"" who was actually an undercover cop. | Not HR (and no longer with the company) but one woman was fired after accusing another employee of stealing her meds. She posted it on FB and tagged the store manager. Whole ass investigation went off‚Ä¶. Thing is, she had a habit of forgetting she took her meds. And when the manager went to check things out, he found a few pills that had fallen out of her bag under the lockers. So he was a. Pissed she accused someone so publicly. And b. That our porter didn‚Äôt clean under the lockers. She was escorted off the premises by LP. (They got involved because of the very public nature of her accusations) | A dude got drunk and brought someone back to fuck in the lobby. Passed out and were found sleeping naked by staff the next morning. | I had to fire a dude for refusing to zip up his pants. He walked around with no belt, waistband unfastened and fly all the way down. He would zip everything up when he walked around but at his desk it was open season. His excuse was jock itch. | Used to work at a can making factory. We had these large spools of copper wire that would used for the welds on the cans. Story goes that one night, the night shift supervisor decided to try and steal one. He rocked up with a flatbed truck and attempted to carry one out to the carpark on a forklift. Supposedly some people saw him and shut the gates. Police were called but I'm not sure what happened from there. | Shared a dick pic in the team whatsapp group. This was before delete message feature. | 3 of us worked in the office, me , the secretary and the boss...we always flirted a lot and one day the boss said he would be out all day and one thing led to another and we ended up banging on his desk only for him to come back and catch me shooting my load all over her, needless to say, we lost our jobs that day, but oh was it worth it. Been together since. | Sex in the stairwell‚Ä¶ oops. | Corporate Vegas party, fight with a pool bartender for cutting off drinks | This chick once stole packets of milk from the pantry , put then in her bag and took the company transport bus back home. Guess what, one packet broke and everyone knew she had stolen it from work. Handed in her laptop the next day. | I had a guy shoot himself on accident in the cube next to mine. ¬†Just around 1 year before retirement. ¬†He was a real conservative dumbass who thought he had a right to a gun everywhere and had it in his bag with the safety off and caught it on something and boom. Shot him in the leg.¬† | Had a manager at McDonald's, who was a opioid addict. She got caught sucking her husband off in the walk-in, but she didn't even get fired for that. She was regularly stealing money from the register to fund her addiction. The owner felt bad and paid for her stint in rehab. She came back and did it again. | That I personally know of, dispatcher got caught jerking off to porn on a company computer. | They were using the company's landline to call 1-900 sex numbers | Dumbest reason ever. Lazy sales person parked in a Handicapped Parking spot while visiting a customer. Got a ticket. Tried to get the customer company to pay the ticket. Finally, asked if ticket could go on expense account. Lol. That one went all the way up to the CEO. Fired that Friday. | Retail: Manager drove a new hire home after a closing shift (I think the new hire was a family friend but he was maybe 19). She stopped by a bowling alley and got a few drinks, proceeded to start a fight which her employee had to step in and deescalate. Employee then drove the manager home but didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äústeal her car‚Äù so he slept on the couch. Manager‚Äôs boyfriend shows up at 5am and questions the employee. The boyfriend then makes the employee get in the car and run an errand. Thankfully, the errand was just taking the boyfriend‚Äôs daughter to school. After a few hours, the employee gets dropped back off at the managers house where she rushes to get ready for work. She drives the employee to work, has him clock in (though he wasn‚Äôt scheduled), where he works for 45 minutes, clocks out, and leaves. I catch wind of this, conduct the interview with the employee, get every detail before I call the manager and ask, ‚ÄúCan you tell me why you had (employee) clock in for 45 minutes when he wasn‚Äôt scheduled to work?‚Äù Technically she quit, but I remember my manager saying, ‚ÄúYou should turn this into a screenplay.‚Äù | Not Hr, but I used to work at a retail store in highschool and my lead was a ~50 year old man who seemed like a nice enough guy, was a substitute teacher, and had a wildlife photography business on the side. Well one day he was talking to one of the girls working who was underaged, and she asked him what he did that weekend, and he proceeded to show her a picture of him having sex with a former coworker‚Ä¶ he was promptly fired | Dude took a dump on a clients property and his coworkers dimed him out. 

When I told him why he was being let go he said: ""So you're firing me for taking a shit?!""

I said: ""Yes"" | Not in HR but had been promoted to head counselor in a children's camp I used to work at years ago.

Two counselors (18f & 19m) that were staying in the camp, sleeping in the tents with their teams of kids decided to have sex. This was *not* allowed on camp grounds, obviously. 

There were more than 5 places where they could have sex without getting caught. They decided it was a great idea to do it in the tent while a bunch of 5-6yo kids were sleeping.

A little girl woke up, saw them and ran away screaming because she thought the guy was choking her counselor.

So, in the middle of the night, we all rushed out of our tents because a child was screaming and saw the girl running, her counselor chasing her to calm her down (half naked with her breasts still hanging out) and the guy counselor chasing after them yelling at them to be quiet.

They were fired on the spot. I had to make up something to calm the poor kid down. And deal with her (understandably) furious mother in the morning. | One of our couriers was watching porn in his van on company time and wanking.

Don‚Äôt ask me how they know about it. | Not in HR, but my friend told me about a guy at her job who got fired for constantly taking naps in the supply closet. They gave him warnings, but he kept sneaking off for 'breaks' until they eventually let him go. Definitely one of those 'seriously?' moments | Dude came into work absolutely loaded. Disappeared at our first 15 min break, came back 20 minutes late. This guy generally sagged his pants a bit, I saw him lean over and it was clear his chonies were missing. Turns out he shit himself (he was on heroin) and tried to flush his underwear down the toilet. He left a poop stained sock on the bathroom floor. He also happened to leave his fully loaded heroin rig on the bathroom shelf. That workplace was a nightmare lmao. | If there is a book about people getting fired by their companies, I would definitely buy them. (Of course including references so it is not a fantasy) | Not in HR, but an infamous story from my first call center job.

One of the workforce supervisors was at the company holiday party and got really drunk (he had a history of alcohol issues). He started to act out and began to hit on another supervisor's wife loudly. Eventually, that supervisor, who was his friend (and who was known for being very large and strong) basically put him in a gentle bear hug to try to physically remove him from the situation/room and avoid any more embarrassment/awkwardness.

The drunk workforce supervisor wiggled free and went under a long table where some of the food was set up. He crawled under the whole length of the table, barking like a dog, and then came out from under the table and bit one of the HR generalists on her leg.

This workforce supervisor was hired on at my new company a few years later and was horrified that I was there from our old employer, and begged me not to tell anyone what had happened. He had gotten himself cleaned up, fortunately. | [removed] | Help desk went to type portal.office.com, something else came up after ‚Äúpor‚Äù. | I was smiling and happy at work. It meant that I was ""disaffected"". | Forced to resign after a work injury. My attorney couldn't save my job of over 20 years. | When I worked at JCP in 2007, The supervisor from Men's was terminated and escorted out by law enforcement for sending inappropriate texts & Myspace messages to a minor employee. | Resident arrested during grand rounds as he had a warrant out in his home state for child molestation, which he was convicted of and now in prison. | Not HR, but a female coworker in retail had her winter boots ejaculated on by a temp worker. He was fired. | He won employee of the year. As the HR person I was supposed to go with him so the conference where he and the other award winners would be honored. Two weeks before we were supposed to travel to Albany, he disappears. Totally out of character. We tried everything to get in touch with him. We called for a welfare check by police, we called his emergency contact (who cursed me out then hung up on me). Nothing. I was checking newspaper articles to see if they found a dead body that fit his description. Anything I could think of. Finally I decided to do a database search of the prisons.  Found him. Locked up for 2nd degree r*pe. It was one of those ‚Äúperson you‚Äôd least expect‚Äù situations. Gentle, soft spoken dude.  Wild | I was an experienced senior in a job I used to work at. A few new employees started and they asked me to have one of them shadow me. No problem. We would use a y split headset so they could hear in on our service desk calls.  First or maybe second day he made it apparent he needs a pay advance for rent, as he won't get paid for the first 2 weeks since they just missed the pay schedule.

Anyways he's there for about 3 days then disappears. We hear he's sick and I remember thinking that's very unfortunate timing. Weird. Monday happens and he's back, and he's extremely sore in the way he's walking and sitting. Apparently, he had his appendix taken out. It burst and went to the hospital in the nick of time. I was alarmed and concerned and asked the usual shouldn't you be at home resting a few weeks? He said yeah but he's contact for the first few months, and that means more unpaid time off. While he was in the hospital, his girlfriend broke up with him, and basically took everything from their apartment, so he's also dealing with that.

1-2 days go by, and everything is normal. He rolls in like usual Thursday mornring with a huge shit eating grin on his face, like he can't contain his joy. So I eventually mention oh, you're looking happier. He said sure am! Can you keep a secret? I relent and say yeah, I mean it depends on what that is usually, but sure.

He opens the Sunday Sun (major newspaper in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, at least at the time. Turns to page 7, and his face is there right under TD Bank in Kanata robbed yesterday. A perfect still from a security camera showing his face close up, in perfect detail saying suspect shown above etc etc.

So I'm thinking oh man, I have to say something, at least by lunch.  
Turns out that never needed to happen. He told one of our co-workers that he went on smoke breaks with, a very friendly, outgoing chatty gal who was very nice to talk to.. she went straight to our manager and told right away, like one should.

Within a short while later, 2 police officers come to my desk, arrest him, ask me maybe a question or two, but nothing serious. He's still got the newspaper with him, and gets carried away.

He messaged me a month later (he was fired, of course) through email saying he got off with parole because he's a first time offender, did not have a weapon, nor does he have any. he literally used the ole' finger in the shape of a gun in his jacket pocket etc.

Also the money was nowhere to be found.. he paid off his debt. Bank has insurance... pretty crazy day. | Don‚Äôt work for this company anymore, but there was a supervisor who had an off-site meeting/happy hour and had a bit too much to drink. He whipped it out in front of a few ladies. Fired the next day. His wife worked there too. That was awkward. | Not HR, but someone in our CS department got fired their first week for trying to sell drugs in the office, right out in the open too.  He wasn't even trying to hide what he was doing. | Owned a shop and the employee closed up for two hours as a gentleman caller came in. Could see them go upstairs but no camera upstairs. From how they appeared downstairs fairly obvious.  When confronted they admitted it and we fired them for gross misconduct. | Dude was jerking off in the stalls at work while other men were in the restroom and could clearly hear what was going on. He didn‚Äôt get fired because they technically couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúprove it‚Äù but he was managed out of the company fairly quickly afterwards. | Im an HR and i fired a guy who was watching porn on the company computer, which is screen monitored. 
Another guy was hitting up on every new female that come to work with us, when confronting him, he said ‚Äúi love them‚Äù | Not in HR. During my company's annual Christmas party one of the managers got super drunk and was hooking up with multiple guys in the ballroom bathroom. The hotel staff essentially banned the three individuals from the hotel, and spoke to our boss about the incident. All three individuals were fired on Monday. | I was driving cars for a shady dealer.(under the table while I was laid off from my real job) Got a call that my uncle had attempted suicide and was in a psychiatric ward in a local hospital and wouldn't talk to anybody else but me.

Told boss I had to roll. He said something like; ""Your job comes before family. If you leave, don't come back.""

I left. The next morning he called and asked me why I wasn't at work. I hung up on him. | Not HR myself, but a few HR employees got fired because they were hooking up in a wellness room meant for nursing mothers. | Not hr but a manager was playing music on a Bluetooth speaker ¬†and then went into the bathroom and started watching porn and there was plenty of people who heard it . So lost a 85-100k a year job because he was dumb enough not to remove the Bluetooth ¬†and also want to watch porn at work but no one would have known he watched porn if he disconnected Bluetooth¬† | Worked in HR admin a lifetime ago. Drinking culture among the sales team, pharma bunnies and gym bros. Lots of people hooked up at sales meetings, not all single. 

But one national meeting, the VP of HR (young woman) walked in on the VP of Sales (60 soemthign man) fucking one of the younger reps in an elevator. He was married. She was his report. He had been gunning for her for a director position. They were both on a lot of drugs. He invited the HR VP to join. She had to get hotel security and the police involved because the hotel had kids staying there, though thankfully this was at like 3 am. 

We had an interim VP for a while and the bars started capping everyone at 2 drinks on the company, 4 total. | A senior engineer printed a whole stack of porn pics to the network printer in the admin pool area when he was working over the weekend. We called the event the ""Monday Surprise."" | He attacked another employee in the break room because he took the last soda.  He was very calm afterwards and told us, ‚ÄúI understand I‚Äôm fired I just want to go on record on why I had to choke them.‚Äù  We told him it wasn‚Äôt necessary and had them escorted out of the building. | I'm not in HR, but I've seen a lot of fucked up things go down over the years. At one company I worked for in the late 90's, these two incidents both happened on my shift.

A guy got caught printing child porn at work. This was after the company had rehired him because he went to prison after he got drunk at a party and started bragging about molesting his kids.

A supervisor was fired because he tried to rape a woman when she came in for an interview. Rumor has it he was also high on meth at the time. | Couple of goofies bumping uglies in the parking lot. They lasted about three days. And I mean bumping uglies, yeesh. Then there was the trainee they gave me who came in constantly trying to tell me her ‚Äúsexcapades‚Äù lol. Gross. | A coworker and his wife solicited a female employee for group sex during an off-site work gathering. She declined but they continued to press in HipChat messages. 

Both terminated upon her HR complaint. Somehow they felt victimized. | Guy would eat his lunch while sitting on the toilet in the men's room. I guess enough people complained. | There was an employee at my job who got fired for no call, no showing. The reason he no called, no showed? Well, he was in jail for sexually assaulting a 13 year old girl. She wasn‚Äôt his only victim, either. Some of the case documents got leaked and it was revealed that he had numerous relationships with underage girls and had even engaged in sexual acts with his own daughters. 

I guess he assumed he would be fired, so he never tried to contact us about his job. Honestly, I probably would‚Äôve ignored the call had he tried to reach out. People like him deserve to be locked in jail for the rest of their life. | I could write an entire book about this stuff but‚Ä¶ Guy showed up drunk & climbed on the roof of a high security building. Just before he had SAed a coworker in the parking lot and pulled a weapon out of his car. So the combo of events really didn‚Äôt do well for him. | Not HR, but at a former job, the new CEO was fired after his first holiday party for grabbing several guy's butt's at the end of the party. | Not fired (should have been), but I once took a pile of speculative application forms up to a manager that he had asked to look through for an upcoming vacancy he had planned in his department. 

He asked me to wait while he quickly scanned through each one and added each to a ‚Äòyes‚Äô or ‚Äòno‚Äô pile based on whatever criteria he was applying. When he got to an application from someone with a very obviously Asian/Pakistani name he immediately put it on the ‚Äòno‚Äô pile and said to me (and not even in a conspiratorial whisper)‚ÄúWell, he won‚Äôt be getting the job if he‚Äôs got a name like that.‚Äù

I told him that was completely unacceptable and made sure that person did at least get an interview (not that they got that job although they did end up being a good fit elsewhere and did get offered that other job), and I did report the manager to our HR Director but nothing formal ever came of it. | Telling everyone on her second day that she had great weed for sale. | Employee was terminated for showing several coworkers a boil..................................on his anus. | I‚Äôm not HR BUT at my last job a guy got fired for literally grabbing one of the female workers by the p*ssy. That was crazy to me. | Another one is a fellow using his corporate card to live in hotels in three cities as he was simultaneously engaged to three coworkers who lived in those cities. | I had to fire a pet store employee who was habitually eating dog treats. 

We spent weeks investigating and watching the cameras because it was so hard to believe. | A kid kept pulling his dick out infront of the guys on the jobsite as a joke. I don‚Äôt know why but yeah, that got him canned pretty fast. | Not HR, but supervisor in a meat department. We had to fire a closing clerk and meat cutter because they decided to -

1. Steal a bottle of vodka from our liquor store.
2. Drank the entire bottle of vodka between the two of them.
3. Got into a water fight using our industrial hose and cleaning solvent hose.
4. Destroyed $5k worth of electronics in the water fight.
5. Realized they were soaking wet and decided to strip down to their undies, put on butcher coats to hide that fact.
6. Put their soaked clothes on a food rack and pushed it into our walk-in oven to dry their clothes.
7. Atrempt to finish their shifts while wearing nothing but boxers and butcher coats, and completely hammered.
8. Did all of the above between 7-9 in the afternoon, while the store was still open and with customers and other staff watching. | Not HR, but here goes.

Worked next to a guy who was a tad creepy, but nothing terrible. Wife came to visit me at work, hated him immediately. Said he was never to meet her daughter.

I'm good with that. She has good instincts.

Anyway, about 3 weeks after he was hired, he simply disappeared. No call, no show. I had his number (work related) and texted him, asking what was up. No response.

Called. No response.

Got a bit worried, googled him, wondering if there'd been an accident or something.

Oh, he was in the news alright. He was rounded up as part of a child trafficking sting. He was arrested for trying to buy an underage girl. Not that buying an over-age girl would ve much better.

Anyway, I let management know he wouldn't be back and showed the search results.

Never understood people like that. | Not in HR, but I had a coworker fired for stealing people‚Äôs shoes. Only high heels, and only the left shoe. I guess it was some kind of hyper specific fetish | Not an HR manager, but I was a manager with a lot of direct reports who had to deal with a lot of HR issues. In the 2010s, I was a call center manager who had some employees who worked in remote offices. I was driving to one of those offices to fire one of my employees who had falsified hundreds of call records while sitting at her desk doing absolutely nothing. When I got there, the office manager pulled me aside and told me that said employee had gotten into a verbal altercation with one of the customers that came into the office in the middle of the space with everyone watching because that customer‚Äôs daughter had broken up with that employee‚Äôs son and there were allegations of cheating afoot. If she hadn‚Äôt been getting fired for the fraud, that would have been enough (she had other write ups).

The office manager then proceeds to tell me that after that verbal altercation, the employee left the office, sat out in her car waiting for the customer to leave, saw the customer walk out, got out of her car, grabbed the customer by the arms and shoved her back up against the brick wall of the office, telling her if she ever spoke to her son again, she‚Äôd kill her.

And this all happened literally 24 hours earlier, the office manager just found out about it 10 minutes before I walked in from taking a call from said customer who said they were looking at pressing charges and wanted to know if the security cameras caught anything. (To my knowledge, she didn‚Äôt press charges. No idea how that situation resolved.)

Two years later, that employee messaged me on Facebook when she saw I was advertising a job opening and asked if the company had marked her down as available to rehire. I told her I would love to have cajones as big as hers to even think about asking such a goddamned ridiculous question and I blocked her. | Anybody who works in HR knows better than to interact on any social media platform.

Unless they‚Äôre stupid, in which case; details, please!! | 50 years ago I worked for a company where the manager hated Hispanics and fired three of them on baseless charges. I was one of them.  We complained but nothing happened. | CFC | Wasn‚Äôt technically fired, but when my contract was up for renewal my employer said he thought I backtalked too much. He wasn‚Äôt going to fire me for it, but he did want to cut my hours. I guess so he‚Äôd experience less of my annoying backtalk. So I quit. And a month later he called me asking me to please come back and offered me a permanent fulltime contract with better pay. | I ran a small IT Consulting firm and had an excellent relationship with one of my first net new clients that I had landed.  Five years in to us supporting them I get called into the founders office and there are 4 people that I had never met in there.  My client had just finished one of their most lucrative contracts that they had ever done, and the books did not look like it.  They had hired a forensic accounting team to look into it, and they had said there could be 3 people that had access to be able to embezzle money, and I was one of them.

I immediately said that we cannot support them while we were under investigation, and gave them some recommendations for someone to take over and said that we would need to go through an attorney (we are talking $2 million in lost money).  Even before the people that I had recommended could get a chance to start working for them, they lost a drive on their mail server, and the investigator said that they could clear me quickly since I could get things back up and running more easily than anyone else.

After clearing me, I asked for more details on what they were looking for, and they said the other two were the owner of the company (the one that hired them), and the controller.  I had been to the controllers house, so I did a log search on the emails that contained the number for her house, and the last 4 of one of the company credit cards and got \~$200k in things being sent to the controllers house in 30 minutes. Gave that to the FBI, and they were able to get warrants off of just that.  Some of the charges were things like $300 per week in fresh flowers delivered to the house, beauty treatments  over $1k every month, renting a trailer in Shreveport that eventually came out it was to use for an affair.  The controller pled guilty and was sentenced to 4 years in prison with probation after that.  

The whole thing was interesting, and helped boost my experience in security services and I even joined [InfraGard](https://www.infragard.org/) which heled expand my contacts for growing the business. 

TLDR: Controller embezzled $2 Million dollars over the course of a year on really stupid things and I help with the initial evidence. | Had a guy buying drugs off the black market. He still lived with his parents so he sent the drugs to work. It didn‚Äôt take too long for someone to hear the pills inside the box with random names and address. | At my Dad's job (a big car company), there was a dealer manager who got fired for doing it with a coworker on the job, in the building.... and on CCTV footage. | Sales Director (Female) was fired for sexual misconduct. She got way too drunk at a La abroad work conference and ended up lifting up girls skirts, went up to guys and invited them to her room etc. Wild. | Sending unsolicited dick pics to a female employee. With face included in some. | A team lead I worked with at the local hospital kept sexually harassing a female coworker. She went to HR to get it handled and HR told the team leads wife, who was an OB nurse, who then proceeded to slander the female coworker(calling her a whore and a liar) and made her life hell until they fabricated enough minor incidents to have her fired. | not HR... but in one of my previous job we had a guy that up and disappeared missing person report and everything, comes to find out he accidentally sent a link to a folder full of child porn to his ex-girlfriend that worked at the same company which of course she turned in to HR which led to him to get fired except they never got a chance to fire him because he committed suicide a week or so after.

  
another time in the same company the finance guy got fired because he was accused of filming up little girl's dresses at publixes around the area...

these two were almost back to back needless to say background checks were enforced after that. | Guy took off his clothes and lit them on fire with gasoline on a job site. Butt ass naked | Decades ago: Some forklifttruck driver fucked some order picker behind a couple of pallets of stuff. Right in front of a camera. | Math professor at my university got caught caught looking in the math lab. Apparently part of his duties was to man it but students rarely came during the hours he was there. A female student saw him with his junk out and got the cops. You see, it was a closed door but a closed door with a window in the door. Yes, he had an office. Yes, it had a lock and no, it didn‚Äôt have a window. 

The wildest part was that the first words out of his mouth when the cop confronted him was ‚ÄúThe boys weren‚Äôt underage.‚Äù Like - what? No one could see the screen; everyone assumed it was adult women. He was allowed to leave with the laptop so I suppose they‚Äôll never know. What an awkward thing to have to tell your wife at dinner, though‚Ä¶ I heard she was a SAHM, and he was only 2-3 years from full retirement and tenured. 

A janitor confided in me that they cleaned up human uh starter kits from chairs in that lab frequently and had known it was him for some time. | Not HR.. but a guy put a pen down some girls ass Crack after she bent over to either pick something up .. guy had been there 20 plus years. I hated him so I was glad he got fired.. just unexpected | Guy hired as a PM. He seems nice enough but someone in the office googled him and it turns out that he killed his wife for insurance money and did a lot of time for it. a lifetime movie was made off it. None of the women were comfortable around him after that. And he had not disclosed it upon hiring. Not a good fit if you are to be responsible for millions of $. | Dude at my job got fired cuz he asked a minor if she was pink or brown LMAO | Not HR, but HR is the one that was fired. Factory job, she was sleeping with one of the maintenance guys | Where I worked, girl had a train ran on her while on the clock with management and co-level employees, recorded it, and uploaded it for Only Fans.

He got drunk on the job. We had random breathalyzer checks in the morning so he always came in sober. But that day he got so drunk that he fell head on the emergency stop. Security found several empty 2l plastic wine botles in his locker. | We had a technician pick up an undercover prostitute in his work vehicle on camera. Police arrested him and towed the work truck. | I'm not HR but this happened at Wal-Mart. There was a assistant manager and a department manager (At the time when they had these types of managers but things changed at Wal-Mart)

The assistant manager was a liked manager and he was married and had a family, well it got out that the department manager was pregnant and she wouldn't say who was the father was. There were rumors that the department manager wanted a baby and seeked out to the assistant manager to help her with that with no strings attached! He took the deal because the baby turned out to look like him because the department manager was White and the assistant manager was Hispanic. His wife came into Wal-Mart yelling at him in front of everyone. I never saw him again!
But yet that department manager became a higher up... | Taunting a coworker who is blind by saying ‚ÄúHey don‚Äôt trip over that chair!‚Äù and ‚ÄúHey your fly is undone!‚Äù | Director started banging one of his staff, the rest of the staff knew about it and kind of blackmailed him so they began using their corporate cards for personal purchases and he approved the expenses. Almost the whole team got sacked.

Also had a boss who got fired because he was on a business trip, rented porn in his room, and when he saw it on the invoice, tried to alter the receipt and did such a bad job the accounting department caught it immediately. It wasn't the porn they were concerned about, it was the attempt at forgery. | Literally smoking crack onsite lol | Not HR but using a meeting room to host a drunken orgy after hours. | Two people got fired for banging in the quiet room. | I used to work with a guy who wrote my little pony fanfic‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. I know it‚Äôs not HR firing related but I kind of just needed to tell someone that LMAO | While Trust Company of the West technically fired Jeff Gundlach because they thought he was going to leave and take clients with him, they subsequently sued him for violating company policies when they found drugs and pornography in his office after firing him.

He got the last laugh. Started his own firm, took a bunch of TCW‚Äôs clients and is now a billionaire. | My ex-boss was fired after he made a direct reference to my chest in a public setting. | Blackmailed (or tried to) a female with her nudes‚Ä¶ that he stole from her phone. | I got tons of them from my local newspaper days. 

We had SEVERAL employees get fired for having sex on the gurney in the first aid closet. We had to fire so many of them, that we had to hire a bunch of people. Then send them to one of our sister papers to learn the processes. Then let all of them go at the same time. It was a mass walk in/walk out. It was also at our press facility. We normally had cops on site because we often had issues walking people out of that facility. That night/morning, they had 5 or 6 officers there. Also, we had to lock down the closet before they were let go and have it cleaned by what amounted to a hazmat squad. How did we find out? A jealous employee ratted them out b/c they weren't part of the in crowd and WANTED to be. <face palm> Another detail to the ""case"" that lead to discovery was that the closet door would be locked when someone would need access. That lead to questions. People really are horny and dumb. 

We had a reporter let go because he was using his company laptop (he blamed is teenage son) for porn on multiple occasions. The timestamps matched up to when he was covering stories from the press area and sending Emails from his company phone. (Always wondered if he was showing stuff to his fellow press pool reporters.) We only discovered it once he took it to our IT staff b/c ""he had a virus"". They pulled all the info for timestamps and location and we matched to his company phone records. He still denied it. Filed a wrongful termination suit. Got laughed out of court.

We had a sales rep get fired because he was running cocaine for a local car dealer. How did we find out? He rolled back into the office pretty excited and his face was quite literally covered in ""powdered sugar"" from the donuts he had no bought nor brought into the office. I left before this case was settled. 

We had a group of newsroom people get fired because they were logging into cash wins online poker rooms and dumping their hands to guarantee one of them won some of the online tournaments. Our IT staff caught them before the online poker room caught them. How? They ignored a series of Emails that we were upgrading network components after the press run one night. They complained there was no internet access. That led to a series of standard questions which were met with surely responses. The admin they cornered was the kind of guy you just don't do that. He examined all the logs and traffic data we had been storing to analyze for the network upgrade and found everything. It had been going on for months. We had to let go of one of our interns that basically tipped them off how to get to an ""outside"" network circuit where they could use VPNs to circumvent the IP detection the site was using to keep this very thing from happening. It was really early in the online poker days so it wasn't as sophisticated as it probably is today. There was a group of about 1/2 dozen non-essential newsroom people that got let go plus our IT intern. I don't know if anything became of that in a legal sense.

There's more but these are the ones I was involved in most. I was the app admin for the HR department's tool suite. I had a good relationship with the IT squad. | At a hospital. Plumber slapped my ass really hard at work. Totally uncalled for. In front of the receiving Clerk. His union protected him and he didn't get fired until almost 2 years later for breaching. 

Another guy who worked as a tech got caught fucking a nurse in the locker room showers. Both unionized and never got fired.

One guy touched a girls thigh, got fired immediately. | When I worked at Booz Allen almost twenty years ago, three employees were fired for having a threesome in the stairway at the Udvar-Hazy Air & Space Museum during the holiday party.  Epic. | Sometimes I scan Reddit in the bathroom on work WiFi. Do they know I‚Äôm looking past some NSFW post as I‚Äôm scrolling? | My mum had to fire some guy who worked at a bank (big 4 in Aus) for having an orgy on a couch in a branch. Obviously there was plenty of cctv footage. | One time a guy on our floor was late for a meeting and someone asked where he was and one of the higher ups goes ‚Äúidk probably butt fucking his boyfriend.‚Äù She was fired the next day. I think she made around $150k a year | One place I worked had a tech support department that would screen share their screen with customers to train them on managing their websites. A new support guy who was there less than a month goes to screen share and started getting porn popups on his computer as he was trying to train a customer, who hung up and called the CEO.

Another place had an executive and head of the dev team, both married were having an affair. People noticed they would both call in sick on the same days and/or leave the office early some days around the same time so it was kind of an open rumor that I guess since it was an open rumor they got careless and both stayed late one night and the CEO came back after like 15/20 minutes and found them on the conference room table. | My boss hired her daughter to work in our department.  Since they had different last names the nepotism slipped by unnoticed by hr. Boys also hired a very handsome young man about the same time because she wanted to bang him... daughter beat mom/boss to it... turns out dude is a man whore and proceeds to sleep with every female coworker and multiple customers while daughter thought they were exclusive... mom/ boss finds out and stalks guy after she leaves the office.  Guy goes to the gym to play basketball boss/mom sneaks in and attempts to shoot him but misses. She's doing 20 years now and everyone got fired... the worst part is boss/mom knew he had warrants for child abuse and could have taken care of the problem by reporting him but destroyed her life instead | Dude got fired after a couple of sexual harrasment complaints. Turns out he was sticking his hands down female coworkers pants. Same guy had apparently been fired elsewhere for sexual harrasment, and at the time of his firing from our work place, had abandoned his wife and child to go to an eastern country for a trist with underage ladyboys. He came home with a new bride from the Phillipines as well.

This same guy failed to report potential child porn found on a customers computer. He didn't see the problem with it. I reported it and within an hour the CBI was in my office, explaining to me what I could and couldn't say to the customer, and leaving with their computer. 

He was something else. | There‚Äôs some insanely dumb people in the stories quoted in this thread. It makes you wonder how many crazy things happen at work that we just don‚Äôt ever even hear about | I worked for (insert 3rd party Packaging service) and it was at a time when they had a heavy temp for hire workforce. There was one guy who came and seemed as if he was seeing women for the first time in x amount of years. A lot of the ladies complained that he made weird comments to them and even would be standing by a few of their cars on break time. A few weeks go by and he mysteriously disappeared. It had come to light that he as recent as a few months before was released after serving time for kidnapping and stalking | Not HR, but I had a coworker get fired from a production facility for making a crossbow.




The dude had no ill intent, they just didn't have a lot for him to do at the time and he was bored and started tinkering. | Not in HR, but once had a woman who confided in her supervisor that she believe I was ""a demon sent to torture"" her. Apparently one time she was in the woman's bathroom and believed that someone was on the other side of the wall in the men's bathroom flushing all of the toilets to torment her. When she came out of the bathroom I apparently just so happened to be coming out of the men's bathroom. She reported all of this to HR, they obviously didn't take her seriously. She kept reporting me, so they told her to use the bathroom on a different floor. A few weeks later apparently she is on the first floor using the cafeteria bathroom and she claims it happens again so she went into the men's bathroom looking for me. Mind you, she freely told all if this to HR and HR didn't warn me that this crazy lady that sat a few feet behind my cubicle thought I was a demon. Her supervisor eventually told me. So she got in trouble for telling HR she went into the bathroom looking for me, but she didn't get fired. She then cornered another one of our coworkes on an elevator and got in her face abd menacingly told her ""I know all of you have been talking about me"". That was strike 2 I guess, but she still didn't get fired. Her final straw was when an outside contractor who had a desk on our floor coughed and she yelled out ""is that how you sound when your doctor checks your prostate!"" Across an office full of people.

The moral of the story here is HR didn't care about my safety, but they damn sure weren't gonna let her offend an outside contractor üôÑüòÇüòÇ | Dude had tens of thousands of very NSFW images on his laptop, set them up as a screensaver.  Was totally shocked to find that this was not allowed in the office. | Not HR, but back in High School the color copy guy at Kinkos got fired for making color copies of his dick. 

Color copier was in full view of the entire store.  I thought it was pretty funny at the time. | my ex has lost jobs due to watching porn, calling in too much to stay home to watch porn, masturbating in the work bathrooms and closets, watching porn while driving in between clients‚Ä¶ | I know of a guy who used the company printer machine during work hours to copy his flyer for an upcoming furry event. He left the original in the copier and got fired within a couple days I think. | This year only five people got fried for fucking in the concession stands. At my job | Sitting on multiple different coworkers laps for a whole shift. 

I asked a couple new hires to work on some stuff in our monochrome section. So basically connectors and wires, small stuff. 

I come back and she‚Äôs sitting on his lap. And believe me, I tried.  ‚ÄúHi, coworker, would you like me to bring a chair for you?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôve already got one! Haha‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou both understand how this isn‚Äôt really appropriate in this environment, and I would really appreciate if you would sit separately.‚Äù 

I stopped arguing pretty quickly. I worked a night shift. I told HR the next day. That was hell of an awkward meeting. | Not HR but someone I worked with was fired for propositioning colleagues to swing with him and his wife. Was a team leader too. | A long time professor required his students to keep journals of their dreams in as much explicit detail as possible, so that he can take them home to read and analyze them. For years, he wrote extremely weird pervy responses to the female students. Eventually a new freshman showed her parents who then went full scorched earth. He was promptly fired and banned from campus, etc. | Not fired, but fired adjacent.

Had a field technician (f) who I heard from a client that he had arrived on the job site first thing in the miring to see her bent over the tailgate of her truck, by a worker who wasn‚Äôt her husband.  A week or so later she got fired, my boss had the technician , and her husband in his office to do the firing.  No the guy I shared a large office had heard the tailgate story and were very confused/interested in how that went.  Well a couple of years later when I‚Äôd moved on to another company I ended up at a professional event and ran into my old boss.  We were just shooting the shit and that technician came up somehow.  He actually hadn‚Äôt heard about the tailgating, she‚Äôd been fired for something else.  He thought it was super funny. | Not HR: But in college I was a manager for an overnight callcenter. I fired a guy for stealing hand sanitizer from peoples desks and putting it in his coffee so he could go home sick. Another note, I Fired another guy because he brought a real gun to the office when we had a costume contest for Halloween. Last one was the closest to my graduation but I fired a guy because he says on a recorded line very loudly so everyone in the office can hear, ""What a bunch of fucking (actual n-word slur)"" Bad thing was he looked at me like ""wut"" When I told him to clock out and leave. | HR? No.
Involved? Unfortunately.

Worked at a call center once. Was training for a new project with a training class of mostly new hires. One new hire was heavily into kink hookup sites and within a couple weeks found the profile of another coworker from a different department (same dept. as my partner... this matters). 

Because this new hire decided I'm her best friend (why me?), she decided to shove her phone in my face while announcing, ""Look, it's (coworker)'s peen!""

And then proceeded to show everyone in the training class. I texted my partner, *major problem, I'm coming over for lunch. Keep (coworker) there*. Aaaaaaaaaaaaand that's how I started lunch by telling the poor sod, ""So... I've seen your dick. Along with 30 other people. You need to lock down your shit and call HR, get ahead of this NOW.""

I'll give you three guesses and a vowel, who was fired by the end of a week long investigation. | Was in 8th grade in the early 2000s. Java or Flash player was blocked from the school computers, so a few friends and I were looking through the connected network devices trying to find a way to download it and play yahoo pool. We found a folder on the IT guys PC and used his last name as a password. It was all porn. The teacher saw it on our computer and immediately came over freaking out. Needless to say, he was escorted out that afternoon. Still didn't get to play yahoo pool. | Hospital- woman thought she could bring her cat in for an MRI since she was banging the CEO. She got it all the way to the machine before her coworkers said ""uhhh, no."" | Had both a branch chief and a tech get fired for having an affair. The tech was married too. | I am HR, so this story didn‚Äôt really get out in the public, well ALL of it didn‚Äôt anyway:

We had a fight between two workers where one attacked the other with a craps stick, (work in a casino).  Turns out attacker was ex boyfriend to ‚Äúattacked‚Äù employee‚Äôs girlfriend.  The attacked guy apparently told his new girlfriend he was ‚Äúsick‚Äù and liked child porn‚Äî she turned him in to the police. The attacker attacked CP guy because the girlfriend told attacker (her ex) she was turning him into the cops and WHY. They had kids together.  So he beat child porn guy to let him know ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you F‚Äôn dare touch my kids‚Äù.  Attacked/child porn guy later got jail time (along with a worker from another dept because he was sharing the child porn).  Attacker initially got arrested for assault AND lost his job.  So basically NO ONE had a good outcome‚Ä¶hated he lost his job, he was doing the world a favor. | The duty manager in charge of putting the bottles of liquor away, after the drinks company training rep had done a controlled staff training session with them, decided instead of putting them away to stay behind in the training room and do a whole lot of shots from the tester bottles, then passed out unconscious in a lounge area of the airport her store was in. She was found by airport security and taken away in an ambulance. Medical examination reported nothing but a developing hangover. New duty manager had to be called in quickly to run the duty free store. It was a big one in a big airport. Our company reputation with airport security took a big hit that day. | I used to work in a pub and one of the staff was fired because she was caught having sex on the pool table, after hours with some random bloke. This was after the pub was locked down and so being inside he potentially had access to the tills, safe and alcohol. | Jacking off to porn knowing that cameras are everywhere!
Peeing in a garbage can.
Having sex with subordinates in the building and thinking you're super sneaky. | Easier to just share the CBS News article: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iowa-farm-bureau-worker-accused-of-urinating-on-office-chairs/ | Not HR, but saw someone that was retiring and on their last day they decided it was a good idea to repel down 3 floors (internal court yard type area) where others were sitting in the middle of the work day. From what i heard they got fired instantly and lost all their retirement benefits. | Not HR but i knew a guy that was on the news because he was a youth pastor sexually abusing kids and worked in our marketing department. I was stunned.¬† | How about someone doing everything possible to be fired and the company still refusing?

Long story warning;

So, at my first legit job,I got a promotion to ‚Äúkeyholder‚Äù (basically assistant manager) in exchange for transferring to a failing location to see if I could help fix it. I‚Äôd taken on some extra duties and had helped retool staffing a bit, so they gave me a shot. (This was a now-defunct retail store called Tuesday Morning that sold high end home goods. Expensive sheet sets and rugs, stuff like that.)

It was fucking hopeless. The store manager was a full blown alcoholic who was hammered at all hours. He occasionally slept in the stock room when his wife kicked him out. 

Each store was supposed to have at least 12 employees. SM, AM, keyholder (or two,) and nine associates. This store had four: the alcoholic SM, an AM who had just turned 20, me at 19, and this one poor associate who ended up transferring out a few weeks after I got there.

So began months of me and the AM basically working to cover up this guy‚Äôs insanity. The regional put us in charge of hiring. There was a stack of around 70 applications because the SM hadn‚Äôt touched them in over a year.

I also found out the SM had over 30 HR complaints filed about him. Sexual harassment, general inappropriate conduct, verbal harassment, all the typicals you might find with an angry drunk. Every other employee had quit or transferred to different stores. 

The last straw for me was when he started throwing boxes at me during our monthly major sale day. He said the night before that he was gonna stay late and unbox. I offered to help, he said no. I came in the next day and he had accomplished nothing before passing out on the floor in the back. We had dozens of people asking for stuff that was supposed to be out on the floor, but he had never even opened.

I called the regional and told her I was going back to my store unless they fired him or chucked him into rehab. I ended up going back to my store. He ended up suffering the indignity of his entire store closing solely because of his personal problems, though I don‚Äôt know if he even noticed. He died several years later, I found his obituary when I Googled the store to see if it was still open. | Employee breaking into a jail.  Not escaping but breaking into a jail.  On company time. | Jerking off while driving a tractor trailer üòÇ my man triggered the camera and he was going to town on himself. Those long drives can get to you but damn man. | I am not a manager but i use to work for a credit card company and apply credit cards in a store. It was my first job as a salesman. While i use to work hard to get signups and i could do merely 3-4 a day, my colleague use to do 10-12 in 8 hours. I was always amazed how he did and my manager use to praise him always. Eventually, I understood he use to click pictures of people's Driving licence and then do an application for them 2-3 times. It fucks up your credit score. When he got caught and HR and upper management called him. They checked his telegram and he had more than 90 DL pictures which could be used to do more sign ups. This is was straight up identity fraud but then company would be in trouble so they immediately fired him and his manager. Manager( she knew about it and didnt say anything cuz her sales were going up and she thought at the end of day i am not doing anything) | At my previous job we had a colleague who jerked off in the toilets, just to cum on the doorknob and lock after. 

We figured out it was him after 3 days of this. There were no camera's, so we had to make a ""toilet list"" where you would write your name and time you went to the toilet.

He did that and came on the handles anyways. 

Vile motherfucker. | Not HR, but a former coworker at Walmart got fired for sexual harassment. | We had a manager who would wash his cock in the bathroom sink and when he was confronted about it by higher management, he claimed religious beliefs but they didn‚Äôt care and they asked him for it | Had a manager at a big call center that was super flaky, was always disappearing for hours. One time the divisional manager came by looking for her. We all just shrugged so he went off looking. Later when he didn't come back a couple of us on break went looking. We found them having sex in a meeting room. Turns out the female manager had a opioid problem and the DM was covering it up for sex. Fucked up thing was she got fired for this and he just got unpaid leave for a month because he has been with the company 20 years. Last thing I heard about her was she and her daughter got busted transporting Fent and went to prison. I quit years later and the DM had an affair with a married woman, she had a kid, got divorced and now they are married to each other. | He insisted on calling his female coworkers names like ‚Äúsugartits‚Äù because he thought it was *hilarious*, even after being told repeatedly to stop. | I got fired for telling my boss our projects sucked and we should do more to fight the climate emergency.

Apparently, his mistress followed him to the hospital too and met his wife there. His wife was under the impression she was just a ‚Äúwork friend‚Äù accompanying him. | They say never fish off the company dock....especially if your wifes boat is moored there. | How is that a fire-able offense? | Lol same thing happened at my company but the wife cheated on the husband. And yes they both worked there. | We had a couple in a long-term relationship employed together on the same team. The boyfriend went to pick up his girlfriend and found her in bed with another guy on the team, who was known to be a scumbag. The boyfriend came to work distraught, and when the other dude showed up it turned into a physical altercation. The only one who got fired was the boyfriend. Someone asked HR if they were trying to get the place shot up. | My wife(now ex wife) technically got fired for her affair with a coworker. My kids tell me she even self reported the relationship and was canned. This affair was the reason for our divorce and it was with a subordinate who she tried to shift outside of her chain a few months prior to self reporting it. Shit part is this reduced our assets by a couple hundred thousand dollars in options she lost. | That literally just happened this spring. | You shouldn‚Äôt have fired the person getting gangbanged. They sound like a real team player. | ‚Ä¶was that wrong? | Here‚Äôs the thing I‚Äôve learned from unemployment hearings in Arkansas - if there‚Äôs not a rule against it in the employee manual, then it‚Äôs not a disqualifying offense for drawing unemployment. | He was just sad he wasn‚Äôt invited | Oh wow, they really took ‚ÄúHappy Hour‚Äù to a whole new level lol | ....team building? | He fired them for not inviting him | *Wolf of Wallstreet* | I mean, if they threw a party at the office. They should have expected something could happen.

Perhaps not full on gangbang üòÇ But it's hardly unheard of people hooking up at work parties. | Gangbang or orgy? | Sorry everyone, only the board and c-suite can fuck everyone ü§∑ | Seems like a nice team building exercise... | Pretty sure I've seen that video... | CEO was mad because he wasn't invited | Reported it because he wasn‚Äôt invited. | Don't suppose that CEO's name was 'Martin' and the company was in VA? If yes, can confirm. | Big 4 Accounting. Orientation training week out of state with the whole new class of 1st Years. Two of them caught having sex in the hotel pool and fired before stepping foot in the office. | I don't see where it says you can't | This happened in a Taco Bell in the last year or so. | The parties and number of participants affected are unclear in this comment. They fired ""someone"" which means one person was fired. But what's not indicated is the role of the fired someone in the gang bang. Were they getting gang banged or were they part of the gaggle of gang bangers? | A few years ago, a court in Germany ruled that a one time gangbang at break time is not enough grounds to fire people.

The employer was the Catholic Church. | Team connection | Was this the Taco Bell Fiasco a few years back? | Sounds like jealousy | Becoz CEO wasn't invited to it... | Lots of rules have SOMEONE'S name attached to them. 

We call this The Joe & Lisa Rule: No sex while inside the company premises! Ever! Including multiple serial partners in the same room! And NOT in the Boardroom! | Guess we know who wasn't invited. | Did you have to post a sign saying not to do that? | that's one hell of a team building exercise | That‚Äôs a whole other level of stupid | I've seen similar. One of the engineering drafters got walked in on playing some serious pocket pool watching pr0n and immediately dismissed. Later the same day, someone else in the office read his Facebook as having been laid off because of the 'economy'.... | Not the brightest bulb on the string, eh? | We've got an old guy eho watches porn in his car at breaktime.

A woman pointed out the number 69 on something and he reported her to HR.

He gets in less trouble than she does. | Some people have been caught jerking off while on a zoom call thinking they weren't on camera. These people are idiots and deserve to be fired. | I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine how you pleasure yourself with clear glass windows. Everyone has their kinks I guess. | We should be able to watch a little porn at work | That‚Äôs a level of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a fuck‚Äù I hope to never see. | Not HR, but we had a guy fired for purchasing a subscription, printing the receipts, and watching porn on a work device.  I even pulled the cache to prove he was and dude denied it till the very end. | üòÇ wtf | He was looking to get fired in the most embarrassing way possible. | Of course he was thinking from the wrong head | A few years back in my town there was a couple screwing each other in their work office, lights on. What they didn‚Äôt know was that everybody sitting in the pub across the street could see everything they were doing‚Ä¶
Edit: just looked up the article and turns out the woman had been engaged as well with her fiance waiting at home | ""They told me to be a hard worker. What's it look like I am?"" | Did we work together? Maybe not. Was it a finance guy in nice jeans? | I thought this was America? | My first job at 18 was in a wash bay at a car dealship. One of the service advisors told of a story of going to look for a lot attendant who wasn't responding to pages from the intercom. 


 Found him beating it with the wash mitt in the wash bay. | Hey, my science teacher watched porn in class and he just got demoted! | I knew of a startup where this happened except it wasn‚Äôt for self-pleasure. Unless you call the feeling he got from making his coworkers squirm after he locked his office and left for the day self-pleasure.

There was an award with his name created at the company that was eventually retired when people stopped becoming ashamed of earning it. | My first time as a manager. First day, really excited, thinking I was going to be molding the next generation of yutes.

>Sloppiest Head in/of HR | We had an HR lady that was giving employee's personal info to her bf, who then used and sold it. Both of them did time for identity theft and fraud. | Why do people keep doing this shit?  How hard is it to just use a cell phone with a personal email? | That is awful, literally leaving proof of your ‚Äòlove‚Äô. Can‚Äôt even deny that lol üòÇ | Holly Flax... is that you ? | Wow. This is so random, I‚Äôm reminded of the behavior of dementia patients. | So... she didn't take the $100? | This makes me so sad for her. It‚Äôs heartbreaking when it turns out a man you admired has seen you as nothing but a sexual object for the entirety of your relationship. | I'm a dude but, 100$ is 100$ you wanna see something I got I'm game lol | Man ... as a father of two girls this just makes me sad. I hope they won't have to deal with such assholes | It's not illegal to ask to see someone's tits. That is the true reason why no charges were filed. | TF ü§£ | Almost sounds like someone who wanted to be fired, and tried to get something extra out of it just in case she said yes.  That's so wildly inappropriate | And he considered her motherly, and wanted to play ""Hungry baby"" | I‚Äôll allow this it deals with safety and that is part of NSFW | 13.6 comes out to 13‚Äô 7 3/16‚Äù. That‚Äôd suck coming up to a bridge and being well over 2 inches too tall..üòÇ | Who writes anything in decimal feet anyway? | Who the hell knows how many feets there is in an inch or whatever anyway | I‚Äôve seen guys installing public infrastructure that would get so angry when the plans weren‚Äôt in inches. One day I asked them what the numbers on the other side of their story pole (guide stick for using with laser levels) were, and they said ‚Äúmetric‚Äù‚Ä¶then I asked why the foot numbers lined up perfectly. They had no idea that one side was in inches, and one side was in decimals. | Clearly they were measuring feet and Freedom Units
https://youtu.be/JYqfVE-fykk?si=z2Hc5i2jXKx1xziQ | They metricfied the freedom units! | So unsafe. | There are 10 inches in a foot. There‚Äôs just two more, as well. | I mean it was your fault, but the company hired you without checking that you knew that or training you properly. They definitely deserve to be blacklisted. | Were they chinese? Thinking of Chinese inches to Chinese feet. | I will never understand why people mix metric and non-metric stuff. 13 dragon toes and 6 dwarf noses - ok, but 13.6 dragon toes is jsut asking for trouble. Come on, enter the world of wisdom, get fully metric. | This is probably the most justified ""bad at their job"" firing and not just a ""too much sexy stuff"" firing. | Yeah, I‚Äôve seen that same mistake with lengths of steel pipe. Then they‚Äôd have the audacity to argue that ‚ÄúiT‚Äôs ThE sAmE tHiNg.‚Äù | That's really bad. 

That's not really NSFW though. | Brian tumor? | Did you ever find out why she was trying to poison you? | Not sure you have considered this, but is it possible that they had a brain tumor? | Brain tumor? | Brain tumor? | You can‚Äôt leave us hanging! What‚Äôs in the cubical?! What‚Äôs in the box!? | Now I'm curious, what other travesties were hidden within his desk that made her say nope that quick | Can't leave us hanging buddy | Yeah, well the Jerky plant called and their all out of you! | Hold up. Wait a minute.

You can't just slip those last two lines in. Holy shit. | ayo

that last parapragh hit me quick and hard wtf | You typed out a ‚ÄòWar and Peace‚Äô paragraph about this random dude, and then gave us a Wikipedia synopsis on your dad? Wild ride. | I‚Äôm deeply sorry for the trauma that must have inflicted regarding your dad. | Should write your father story too man that's shit | Back in 2014‚Ä¶ like it was eons ago‚Ä¶ yeah, it‚Äôs in the past, but c‚Äômon‚Ä¶ back in the 80‚Äôs maybe, late 70‚Äôs even‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre making me feel ancient‚Ä¶ üòÇ | Prison seems like a pretty good guess for his whereabouts | Leasure suit Larry strikes again. | That was one wild freaking story üòÇ | Fuckin Larry‚Ä¶ | So what's the story for the vigilante dude with the tire nails? | Nails in the tires is illegal. Birds seed on the other hand... Who's gonna arrest a flock of birds for repainting someone's car?? | Damn, where'd y'all work? | I initially read this as ""...dead stare and skin the queso color of buttermilk."" | I had a coworker pop a physician with that on his work pc. | What's a load out? | You know where she ended up working next? Asking for a friend | Poor gal | Talk about power tripping  jesus | The vanilla extract gal is insane. | What was up with the vanilla extract?  Or was it the old-style stuff that was 40% alcohol? | I must admit, well played from the guys clocking each other in and out. 2 extra hours a day for 5 years is A LOT. | Was the vanilla extract to get drunk or because she loved vanilla? Cause I can understand the later lol. | I feel I must applaud the time card people. That's one of those so simple it's brilliant and if you're not actively looking for it or notice they're not actually there when the time card says they are, I can see how that went unnoticed for five years.  Obviously right to fire them, yes. | You sound like a dick. | Nah, it's going to be on TikTok with a robot reading comments over video of someone doing a Minecraft platforming challenge | Or a Buzzfeed article. | This is gonna end up in one of those smosh videos where they literally just read reddit posts | Dr Hollowed | I remember that episode.. | I'm hopeful it wasn't ill intentioned but it's just so dumb to make that mistake üôà üôà üôà üôà üôà | I'm reminded of the woman giving an interview from her home office and you can *absolutely* see the giant suction-cup dildo on the bookshelf in the background. | This is why you have a work phone! Even if it's a super cheap iPhone SE or a two year old Galaxy, your work stuff stays seperate from your fun stuff. | *she was fired that day and were given a new account rep. IT had to scrub it off my computer*  MMM.    Mnn  bit awkward for sure, maybe explain some things on keeping a private phone privatie, But i dont think its really worth firing someone over :?   and ""scrub my pc"" sounds even more like a weird overreaction | Sometimes IT has the best job. Assuming she was hot. | Always separate your work and personal devices. My coworkers all use their company mobile phones as their main or only device and I just don't get it.¬† | See this is why I like having an Android store all my NSFW content in a Secure folder behind a passcode. | I'm sorry, but why should anyone be fired for that? It's not illegal. It was accidentally revealed. She didn't steal from the company or fail in her job. It's just an excuse to be judgemental. | I'm curious here. So, did SHE record the video of her opening her iphone to display a screen full of NSFW images? Was this like a live stream capture or something? How does someone not recognize they just exposed a bunch of private images to the world? If she was recording it, did she not watch it before saving it? 
  
I don't have anything like that on my phone, but I still cringe anytime I show someone my pics. | Pro tip if on an iPhone - delete everything immediately after taking it, and it hangs out in temporarily deleted files for 30 days. That way it isn't right there when you open up photos. | Being lazy/being late/not callout etc is safe for work, and a super common reason people get fired. | [deleted] | Tell that to whistleblowers | Touch√©. | Now Safe From Working. | I‚Äôve seen guys like this. They do not care. | Seriously, what a legend. | Thought that last bit was a suicide reference for a minute. | Seems to be some missing details in your story? | Why would they arrest the manager?  It's not illegal to be drunk at work, that is a civil thing.  The only thing is if she is disorderly or driving. | That awful. She definitely deserved to be fired and more. | How on earth did you manage to prove this? Did someone film it? | Reminds me of a firefighter taking a piss in a burning smoke filled house not knowing he was being filmed on the thermal camera. Not fired, just a dishonourable mention. | TPN? Is that like VPN? What does the T stand for? | I think the oddball is the man who catches the man in the stall. | Not the person who made this post but you bet. | ""I'm unemployed but..."" | I'm sorry that happened to you. That's scary. | I know I can read, but excuse me? | This sounds like something that an AI would write when the chat gets too long. | That's rape. | That seems to be happening a lot lately | Because ... a teacher having sex with high school students is okay? | What a mortifying reason to be fired. 

Totally justified reason, but I can't imagine the horror the second he realized what he'd done. | The way to cover for that is to say ""Sorry, I meant to send that to my doctor. I am getting treatment for gigantism of the dong"" | And that's how I met your mother.

Am I redditing right? | Lame boss, should have gotten up in that | I‚Äôm just thinking about how funny it would‚Äôve been to forget a computer or something and return to see a colleagues vinegar stroke. | What country is this? North Korea? | I am not familiar with packet form milk. How much milk comes in a packet and how many packets we talking here? | Why do Americans say ‚Äúon accident‚Äù instead of ‚Äúby accident‚Äù like normal people? | That‚Äôs still a thing?? When was this? | No she didn‚Äôt, stop promoting your OnlyFans. | Clearly she was just helping out marketing by creating an ad for the company. | How come I can never find this type of stuff on twitter? | Calling it ""X"" finally makes sense.... | Yay, I passed the test, I get things like porsche and portugal. | What? You work at the  morgue ? | You monster | That workers comp payout though... | They rehired him??? | On a what now? | Wow. Never heard of that happening before. | Transvestite is like the hard R n-word. | The scary part is that a lot of them are that stupid and get away with this for years.  The reasons are varied.  No one wants to be seen as a moral busybody or weird stalker for peering into the private lives of others.  People are just too busy and so the odd patterns that should be obvious in  hindsight just don't register. 

The child victims often don't have the vocabulary to describe what's happening to them. | It seems that a lot of them are. Hopefully that is most of them | It‚Äôs at number 2 now. üíÄ | You would have to make somebody else a murderer for this. Not worth it, just let that pos rot in prison. It's worse than a quick death anyway | Death row costs more than life sentences, if cost is what you‚Äôre concerned about.

It is more expensive to give a death sentence than a life sentence with all the appeals. | A bullet is too quick. | Just put him in general population. The inmates have a code of honor too. | With how inmates will often treat people with child port convictions death can seem like a mercy to them. | Totally agree. Less and less a common sentiment, strangely. Also reddit will not take kindly to you wishing death on folks - even pedophiles. | Sad but true, very very true. 

Like private investigators following cheaters; almost always the same patterns. | This is against human policy at this point anyway | Well for one because some people (if not all) did not chose to have these feelings. However acting on it should not be allowed. That Doesn't mean we should automatically kill somebody who slip in the wrong side. I think this is a complex brain issue and not everyone can't come back to the right side. Most of them need help, not death. | Could be worse, I had a coworker who cheated on his wife with another coworker, this dumb shit got her pregnant | Well they were the best run branch on paper. | Found Toby's account. | They're all family! | Angela cheating on Andy with Dwight | ‚ÄúSeems like you already know where‚Äù | It was on company property. A desk actually. | If the spouse also works at the company this could create problems via work drama and would be a valid reason. 

Employment contracts may also directly state that have in an affair violates corporate policy and is a fireable offense. Large employers often have morality clauses and this would absolutely violate most of them. my husband works for a hedge fund that has that policy. The theory is that if your spouse can't trust you not to have an affair, they can't trust you to manage their money. 

Finally a lot of employers have anti fraternization clauses although this is typically more common when you're in a position of power over someone, such as if you're a manager or part of the security department. | There could be power dynamics at play that leave the company open to liability for sexual harassment. Many companies have policies that only allow relationships outside of departments and if one starts will move one party to a different position or fire them. | This manager I am aware of slept with someone below him so abuse of power? | Nope | No | Some work places have rules about work relationships, especially if it‚Äôs manager to floor-level like the OC implied (although didn‚Äôt outright state) due to the power imbalances, and to protect company from ‚Äöwork favors‚Äò claims | They were caught doing it at work. | From the comments it seems to happen more than I thought | Comment of the Day Award. | Willing to take one from the team | 'Oh I'm sorry, I didn't know I couldn't do that.' | The CEO was not invited. | I'm gonna have to plead ignorance on this one | Its a team-building exercise, gosh. | Excellent Seinfeld reference. | If I'd have known that was frowned upon..because I've worked in a lot of offices and that kinda thing happens all the time! | I mean, it's not something you can just say ''don't do it again!'' to is it? You can't really have an orgy in your company's office and have them be cool with it. | They wanted this, that and the other | They were mad they weren't invited | Should I not have done that? | I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frowned upon, you know, cause I‚Äôve worked in a lot of offices and I tell you people do that all the time. | were there rules not allowing that? | Yeah it was a ‚Äòteam building‚Äô exercise ü§£ü§£ | It was the CEO's wife. | Their only fault was not inviting the CEO | Only because it was multiple levels of employees. 

Everyone at the same level? Bang away! | They don't invite the right people. | Yes Costanza | It was wrong cause the ceo wasn‚Äôt invited to party | They didn't invite the CEO? Rookie mistake | CEO wasn't invited. | 100% | Team building exercise | Not sure I understand this. If they were all consenting adults and it happened after office hours, why is it a fireable offence? | sure... but it was a gangbang, so.... there are limits you know? :D | Every gangbang is an orgy, but not every orgy is a gangbang ü§≠ | isn't a gangbang a type of orgy? :D | nah man this happens all the time. this wasn't even in the US | His hand and waist were under the desk but pretty obvious what was going in. All the office have frosted glass now lol. | Oh no. I got one. We had a guy let go. The cubicles for sales were all in a row along the wall. All were female except one guy who sat on the middle of them all. While all the females were in the office mid day, he left to go to bathroom. The COO walking by needed to look up a part so he went to use the dude's computer. Screensaver off, porn. 

W.T.F. dude?! | a whole load of stupidity | That's a whole other level of confidence. | ...or brave. | Heeeeyyyy‚Ä¶I‚Äôm an engineering drafter‚Ä¶but my door stays open except when I eat lunch in my office. Besides aren‚Äôt most modern day office computers monitored? Idk if I‚Äôd notice if someone from IT had remoted into my computer. | No, a total idiot. Has was an ass to work with too so we were all glad he got fired. Arrogant & lazy too | Well at least it‚Äôs on break in his own private car instead of the middle of the office | Agree. I don't care if someone wants to rub one out, just maybe not at work. | That‚Äôs not porn, that‚Äôs a nude egg I won on my game. It‚Äôs got a little bush what the heeeeeelll | Who the hell pays for a porn subscription anymore? I probably would have fired him just for that.

Also: print to PDF is an option, why waste paper? | In this case it was Indian | It blows my mind people are still this stupid. Never put anything in writing you don‚Äôt want on the front page of the New York Times was the advice I got day one (even though I already knew that since it seems to be common sense). 

10 years with my company now and it is absolutely insane the shit I see or get copied on that people send over corporate email. 

How hard is it to just keep shit on a personal device. | Hardly unique. | Standard in the work work :) I have 4 corporate email accounts. One for my company and 3 for clients. It's a huge pain in the ass | Hi, saw your email, just wanted to circle back and touch base | Dude u had me cry laughing ü§£ | *Did you get the memo on the TPS (total penetration system) reports?

We think there‚Ä¶might have been something else going on up there with him. He was elderly, beyond retirement age. | I'm afraid of getting dementia when I get older, and no longer having common sense to filter out any perverted impulses like this. | Hate to break it to ya but old men are hardwired to be horny until they die. I‚Äôm sure there are horror stories from nurses of male patients begging them for a quickie on their deathbeds.

Mother nature be scary.¬† | [deleted] | No, she didn't take the $50 | No, of course not, the settlement from corporate was much more. | Oh bud, as a nearly 40 year old woman, I've got some unfortunate news for you.. | I know, right?  $100, in this economy? | Brother, that's sexual harrassment...in the workplace no less. Definitely could have pressed charges and / or filed a report. After a deep discussion with the other partners, it was determined to not go that route for the previously listed reasons. | pretty obvious sexual harassment in the workplace | Is sexual harassment not illegal? | Thank you, Mr. President. | Where did you get well over 2 inches? 6"" minus 7.1875"" is 1.1875

Tbh, I'm surprised it caused a huge issue. The error is .73% of the total height of 13.6' which is likely well within the measurement error. | I've seen the result from this. Honestly kind of horrifying to look at to be honest, seeing the top of the trailer peeled back like a sardine can | A lot of civil work is done in decimal feet. | üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Land development here, almost everything is done in decimal feet | Just standard people | It's literally NSFW. | who‚Äôs brian, and why does he have a tumor? | Yes | Chad tumors are preferred. | No that‚Äôs the worst part! I never found out why because OP never answered that simple question! | Nope, brian | You know what in the box is. | I sent someone else and didn't look.

Can't rule out Gwyneth Paltrow's head. | My guess is it was a head. One time I saw a documentary about these cops who were trying to stop a serial killer who had committed murders based on the seven deadly sins. The killer killed the wife of one of the cops and then had her head delivered to the cop out in the middle of nowhere. Name of the documentary escapes me but it was probably something like that. | Cum desk | I sent someone else (male) and didn't look myself. So it will forever remain in our imagination. | It was either an unwashed pocket pussy or an even more unwashed buttplug or dildo.

Totaly not that guy but whenever somebody mentioned a vigilante it reminds me of this bit | Loading a customers vehicle with their purchases. He saw their purchases as an insult to his masculinity. 

I guess I should clarify that this was a hardware store. So he did miss a few of the lumber carts but still had a fair amount of them in one hand and all of the shopping carts in the other. | Unfortunately probably an alcoholic looking for a fix during work | Yeah, for real. | Alcoholism. Vanilla is extracted by being tinctured in basically pure alcohol. 

I knew a guy in college who didn‚Äôt go to my school, he just hung around the campus. He would drink vanilla extract all day long because most of the local stores had blacklisted him from buying real booze | Yup, sure was. | My buddy shared the same sentiment while firing them, from the way he tells it. | Real vanilla extract is about 40% ABV, around the same as a lot of liquor. It's also incredibly expensive, she drank *thousands* of dollars worth of the stuff. | What makes you say that? | I laughed too hard at this, because it is exactly the video I was thinking of. | Which will be then be uploaded to Youtube both by itself and as reaction videos | and to many random sound effects | All I see of Smosh is them reading AITA posts and the ""You laugh you lose"" type challenge with the mouthfull of water.

  
It's also worth noting that all of Smosh I have seen has been against my will, so there is some bias there. | https://youtu.be/_I0xsWM9Rzc?si=j2KxBIU7XcA_jFbc | While I think the humiliation enough is a good enough punishment, its ABSOLUTELY a fireable offense and OPs absolutely needed to request a computer scrub.  If those images were found to exist in any form on their PC then they could be fired in turn.

Companies need to take sexual stuff super seriously, otherwise the company will be the one sued if they knew it happened and take no action.  They care much less about their individual employees than they do about such liability. | The levels of corporate liability exposure for things like that is extreme. All of that makes perfect sense to me | agreed, especially if the phone was her personal phone.  just edit a few frames and move on. | I just broke it down why she got fired [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/s/JAMuQbi2mb). 

Tl;dr: It's not surprising that she got fired. It would've been surprising if she hadn't gotten fired, because there are in fact several reasons to fire this person. | Exposing yourself to coworkers via photos is certainly fireable. | Why it's fireable: the video was for end users. Mistake like that could be disastrously irreparable for company PR.

Why scrubbing isn't an overreaction: imagine any employee held onto those photos. It's discovered. The company is now being sued by the woman for keeping pornographic images of her, possibly even a wrongful termination lawsuit. Big $$$. | Maybe if it had accidentally happened on some kind of a live stream, sure you could chalk it up to an embarassing whoopsie. But if your job is to produce training videos and the product you create and say ""Ok, this is ready to be potential required vieweing for my coworkers and clients"" and that video includes graphic content like this because you skipped any editing or QA, yes, you deserve to be fired for that. | Whether accidental or not that constitutes sexual harassment. Even without that, she showed carelessness that could have caused major problems. | Are you serious? 

Just because something isn't illegal doesn't mean it's not a firable offense. You can be fired for being bad at your job. If you are in sales you can be fired for not signing up enough new customers. If you're an account rep you can get fired for losing an important account, or just putting an important account at risk. 

This falls under that last category. If you had a thousand account reps, 999 could send a training video to a client without porn in it. From this perspective she's a 1 in 1000 bad employee--999 could do a better job than her. 

In addition, there's a customer relationship perspective. To NOT fire her at this point would be sending a message to the customer that they aren't all that important, that being sent completely inappropriate content--and putting the customer at risk of sharing that content with *their* customers, costing them who knows how much business and probably resulting in a news story about the company sending their customers porn--isn't considered a big deal. 

In addition to *that*, the fact that she didn't look over her training video before sending it to her customer is just plain sloppy. You double-check your work when you do things like this, always. This goes back to her just being a 1 in 1000 bag employee. 

Moreover, this is just the perspective of the customer who received the porn. For all we know, the rep was a problem employee for other reasons and was already close to being fired, this being the last straw. 

I'm not quite sure how you've managed to get this far in life without realizing that exposing your genitals to people without invitation or warning is actually a really big deal and (if you get caught) carries a very high risk of disciplinary consequences, among them criminal charges, because it actually is against the law almost everywhere. It's called ""indecent exposure"", and I don't think there's a law anywhere that says it's illegal to make strangers view your junk in person but it's okay to do it with a photo. | Or just use the hide function which is designed for this | What if you‚Äôre a lifeguard? | Downsizing wild be laid off though, which is different from fired.

If you get fired, that's with cause, and there can be penalties (back pay a sign on bonus, relocation stipends, benefits, etc.)

Whereas if you're laid off you usually get to keep all that.

Definitions depend on your employment contract I guess though. | She was being aggressive to the other employee then tried to drive home herself when the cop asked her if she had been drinking. | She deserved more but it never went further then that. SA of men is taken a lot less seriously. People even joked in the office joked that I should have just lied there and took it because ""P$%#%y is P$@$\^y"". Yeah that's how toxic that environment was.

All cases with men and women should be taken very seriously. | She did it in a hotel room with others around. I was sleeping on the floor and when I woke up she was riding me and moaning. 

Others in the room heard the moaning followed by the audible frustrations of me forcing her off me. So there was evidence against her. | Dangerously unwise? Yes

A little funny? Also yes. | It‚Äôs not like somebody kicked the door in. Dude was standing, bumping both sides of the stall while rapidly moving his hand. Not hard to guess what is going on without seeing it. | Creative writing prompt goes brRrRrrRtTt | He hopes his crazy ""totes real"" story gains traction and becomes a meme or is read by whoever farms this post for content | no, it's:  I too choose this guys secretary. | Good, bkibbey. Who gets an upvote? That's right it's you!¬† | Exactly | Probably has something to do with on purpose being the opposite. ¬†English is a silly language and getting caught up on it is a worthless endeavor. ¬† | Why do other people say it wrong and then get mad when Americans say it correctly? | Late 90s | lmao definitely a bot account. | You realize nobody would have checked if you hadn't made that comment just now? You're promoting her OF more than she is right now. | The end of death row? Pediatric hospice? Pet crematorium? | They did. It was a fairly decent position, too. | I didn‚Äôt know that. Monikers change so often it‚Äôs hard to keep up with the latest. This was 30 years ago when that was the proper description | That's why ai can help or just automated system. This job should not be for human. Goes the same with any kind of depravity stuff. | I‚Äôm your huckleberry | There's plenty of murderers already in prison who wouldn't mind, I'm sure. | I volunteer. | That‚Äôs why the firing squad was popularised. The burden falls on no one man. | I volunteer. | I volunteer. Just had a daughter and I would have no qualms. Would be like stepping on a bug. | Guys. We‚Äôre smart. Well I guess that‚Äôs debatable. But anyway, people already in prison feel a certain way about pedos. A pack of cigarettes can get a pedo taken care of | We need to study these people so we can learn how to identify them while they young, before they commit a serious crime. Ideally, we learn how to treat them so they don't grow up to become this. | I wouldnt call it murder. It's like putting down a dog that mauled a child. | Heard his boss hates him. | Simpler than all that. They were fired for doing it at work. | I gotta go with George Costanza's defense here https://youtu.be/Td67kYY9mdQ?si=Gh_h0yDoK2EmDT_1 | Or several! | 'show me in the handbook where it says ""no gangbangs at the office""' | If it had been mentioned in the hiring process or the employee handbook,  I mean... | [If anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frowned upon‚Ä¶](https://youtu.be/ZB62oaOeqR0?si=UQt7YZy9BWFr4ZBK) | The truth is, I DID know I couldn't do that! | That was a good one right. Because I DID know I couldn't do that. | A wise man once told his friend Chip that sometimes, you gotta race. | I definitely read that in Dave Chappelles's 'white guy' voice | ü§£ü§£ | ""I'm sorry, I thought this was America!"" | You see, I didn‚Äôt  know that was frowned upon. | I thought this was America! | It was with the CEOs wife. O.o | ""We all work in different departments and don't report to each other...all good here boss man."" | I can picture Randy being escorted by security now:

What?! What!? I'm sorry, I thought this was America! What?! Oh, I'm sorry! Thought this was 'Murica! | I thought this was a ""*Staff* Party"" | The real reason the terminations happened. | That sort of thing is frowned upon | They were thinking outside the box. | Oh, I'm sorry, I thought this was America. *Randy Marsh intensifies* | I guess if you're not a cool office, and you're a bunch of nerds! | Recruitment bonus for bringing a new member! | because they did it in the office... | Someone had to use that stapler.... | ""In the office"" | Maybe they just didn't invite the 'right' people to partake üòÇ

Can't get fired if the boss and HR are there! | Nah, I don't think so. We need an official definition! | Nah, if only one person is getting fucked, it's not an orgy. Now if 4 dudes are fucking a girl while another 2 fuck each other waiting their their turn with her, technically that's probably an orgy. Really though, an orgy means everyone is fucking, even if not every person fucks every person. | I would have described an orgy as ""Sex with multiple couples involved"". So I'd say no. But I'm no authority on this. Someone needs to summon Charlie Sheen | No. Typically the accepted definition of an orgy requires that there be multiple separate couples involved. Most people would define this as at least three couples so six people. | I like how that‚Äôs the solution | I'm not surprised. I wouldn't want to clean those windows either. | he was helping with frosting the glass right? | did you hire the recently terminated person to do the frosting of said glass? | Dang, he must've been really prolific to frost all that glass.¬† | You'd have thought they'd have gotten round to cleaning it. Impressive nonetheless. | Did he frost the glass? | especially if the desk doesn't have any paneling on the backside. | His did too. Eventually.¬† | Bro, in home office you need to do this on company time. That's the rule! | > just definitely not at work | I‚Äôm not in trouble AT ALL! | This was early 2000's.  It was funny to a point.  Hey ""Bob"" printed out a porn subscriptions on company equipment and here is the logs and cache showing he's doing it.  ""Bob"" - ""it wasn't me"".  Your name and email are on all the paperwork.  ""Bob"" - nope, not mine.  It went on for about a week before the higher-ups finally fired him.  The sad thing is, it wasn't the porn that got him, is was poor work.  I guess because of the porn.  Fun times. | Im guessing cGMP is a little loose there‚Ä¶. | Oh, a base is definitely getting touched. | All the bases | Sadly, dementia can cause people to do all kinds of uncharacteristic things and some of these things are awful. | Assuming this is the US, what criminal charges do you think could have resulted in a successful prosecution? | Well played, Not trying to downplay the seriousness of the situation, but it had to be asked. | Yeah, can confirm, the $20 was still there when HR came by to talk to her about the situation. | In most jurisdictions sexual harassment is not a criminal offense but a civil one. In the places where it is a criminal offense They usually only prosecute when it is pretty significant and a repeated thing where the victim has already made attempts to stop it. | No you‚Äôre wrong!! 

Yeah, my math was off üòÇ. I was thinking 13.5 instead of 13‚Äô 6‚Äù. It‚Äôs been a few months since I had to use decimal inches. | as a non freedom unit user.. That's about the only information i know from your system, but i see why a lot of people would be confused.

For the people using metric : 

1inch \~= 2.5cm \* 12 = 1 foot so \~30cm (gotta understand when people complain about their height/dick size on reddit) and i thiiiink 1kg \~= 2.2 pounds. | I think most of us understand NSFW to be (industry-agnostic) content you wouldn't want a co-worker catching you being involved with and could put your job at risk if discovered: porn, ordering drugs off the dark web, etc.

The fact that nearly all the comments have to do with sex or drugs and almost none have to do with safety violations suggests I'm not exactly talking out of my ass here. | Brian Tu'mor is the person that found the pictures | It's so awful when Brian gets a tumor | it‚Äôs a dick in a box? | Sounds like Se7en... a movie. | No, they're asking why that guy is considered a vigilante hero. | True, a girl did the same with lemon extract in high school and got very ill, but I bet the vanilla lady smelled *fantastic* | Practical analysis but it's way funnier to imagine she just **really** loves vanilla extract. | That‚Äôs one of those ‚ÄúI have to fire you but damn am I impressed‚Äù kind of moments | Firing a guy for seeking help at rehab and not wanting to tell you kinda makes you a dick in my book. | Pretty sure there are more than one video like that. | There's like 5 Smosh channels with varying content. Those two are the most popular consistent series which is probably why you've only seen it. Some of their stuff is exactly what you'd expect from Smosh, some is closer to what Dropout is doing, and some is genuinely really laid back relaxing throw it on in the background content. | My kid watches this guy who reads posts from a AITA rip off made for his channel where the stories are even faker the AITA. All he does is read the post and give a generic couple sentence response acting like it is real. I dont get it | The number of comments (2) saying firing her or scrubbing the video/images off the computer are crazy and shows how little some people know about managing a business.

$10 says they would be ‚Äúover reacting‚Äù in anger if the employee filed a suit that said ‚Äúmy ex employer kept nude photos of me after firing me‚Äù. | OK, fair do's. | You can't commit sexual harassment without intent, can you?

It was a bit careless, but so is dropping your pen on the floor. | Oh well, didn't know the difference. Sorry | Ah, drunk and disorderly. That'll do it. | I figured there had to be something missing.  It's also a good way to get yourself fired! | In 20fucking24?? If she had got pregnant, would they force you to pay child support too??¬†


I'm sorry that happened to you but even more sorry that people are complete idiots. Bodily autonomy is for everyone. | Absolutely right | It sucks, but it's good that she got fired at least. A lot of times men in your situation don't even get that much justice. | Oh ok, makes more sense then. | How much evidence would you need to pull the trigger on another person? Would it be enough if somebody else told you he was guilty? Evidence can be faked. How could you ever be sure? | ‚Ä¶okay? | It's called ""unbecoming of police duties"" or something. | ""I don't ask what YOU do on your lunch break!"" | ""Ain't no rule says a dog can't supervise a company gangbang"" | I ask this very question in a post a few months back about the navy captain who was discharged for shooting a porno in his room on the ship.

I never was a Seinfeld fan, so didn't get the references, but the hilarious thing was the number of people who were quoting navy regs to me. | ""Point to the rule that says, ""Don't fuck the employees."" | These diagrams in the employee handbook are giving me a boner! | Uhh, no, it sounds like they were thinking specifically *inside* the box... | As an Australian this is so fucking funny | But that was the most convenient place to meet | ""MICHAEL!"" | hahaha | ''In the orifice'' | I will keep this in mind for my next office gangbang! | no way... I thought an orgy could be random people, not necessarily couples. right? Like, if it's 4 random guys and 4 random girls, it's still an orgy. | The glass was manually frosted by the occupant. | Its ok to jerk it on company time. It's not different from a cigarette break or gossiping at the water cooler. 

It's not ok to get caught jerking it on company time. The main problem is that its gross for whoever catches you. | Clearly nothing would stop that guy now others don‚Äôt have to deal with it. | Men will probably continue to work there, so. | Lol no. That was our internal maintenance department. We did have his office totally repainted and steam cleaned though | When my late grandfather reached the final stages of his dementia, he would literally hallucinate that his suits would get up and start walking around the house. It sounds utterly terrifying. | No, it didn‚Äôt. | This whole situation over a fiver. Hate to see it | looks like OP will have to fire you as well | it‚Äôs a double entendre | No shit. I know what the usual meaning of NSFW is. But this is literally not safe for work. One word can have multiple meanings, you know. | https://youtu.be/het1kl-A8qw | He accidently harassed a guy who did bad stuff | He didn't show up for work for 2 weeks without giving a reason. Most employers wouldn't even follow up to ask, at least this guy did. | Oh there are accounts dedicated to making these videos, in this exact format. Good for them, it makes money. | I'm not really shocked, tbh. I don't hate them at all- some of those videos are kinda funny- but it's just.... not my type of content.

  
I say this with my background TV show being Below Deck rn. | I think it's because it's super easy content to churn out. React content in general is super quick and if you don't have anything to really add, you don't have to do anything.

  
It's becoming a thing on Tiktok to just superimpose a Chinese person over copywritten content to get past the filters, and I feel like for most react content you can do just that, so with AI it'll be super easy to go and churn out this crap. | Maybe its an american thing.  i really cant see a dutch judge here agreeing with firing here.  and aslong as you didnt forward the picture, i think you got laughed out of court for ""i want to sue the company for receiving a picture i sent them"".......... | Yup.  They aren't really looking at it from the perspective of every OTHER employee, which the employer has to do, too | Yes you can. If you are telling a sexual joke to your friend at work and it offends someone else who overhears it they can report you to HR. That situation would likely only result in a warning. Nudity at work, in any situation for any reason, is more egregious. | Yeah don't know about your country but in the UK being made redundant can come with a significant payout if you've been at your job for a while.  Some places I used to work the old guys were lining up to be made redundant! | Add to that DUI (if she got in the drivers seat with keys accessible, she was ""in control of a vehicle).

  
Thanks, that makes way more sense. | They forced that like 14 year old who was statutorily raped by his teacher to pay child support for the kids when she got pregnant, so probably. | You must not look in comment sections alot when stories about men being raped are posted. Because 90% of the comments are crusty old creatures saying things like, ""where were these teachers when I was in school?"" ""Every little boy's dream"" ""What's her address? I want some too"" etc.

It's vile and disgusting, and it'll never end until the vast majority of men stop wearing sex as a badge of honor. | And this turns into a discussion on the death penalty. | Every computer has a hardware address that can be read on a network. If it's his work computer, and photos of his own child I'd say he's pretty damn guilty. World would be a better place with less people doing messed up stuff | Listen here buddy my job is to just pull the trigger not ask questions | For me to personally pull the trigger after the courts decided it was time to kill them?

An admission of guilt including details not released to the public, followed by a statement of willingness to take the bullet.

Sure, they could be given details and coerced to say all that, but at that point if they don't do it someone else will make their life even worse and it's a mercy thing at that point. | But what if you DO be coming? | I'll tell ya what, the day I can't have orgies in the office is the day I turn in my badge and my gun and call it quits | Yvan eth nioj from the simpsons comes to mind | No such rule,  if it existed,  capitalism itself would be off the table. | Couples as in two people engaging in intercourse together but not necessarily with another group at any given moment. Not a couple like a husband/wife thing. | Glazed, if you will | LMAO | Laughing at a memory of a skit from Nick Swardson's show where he's the HR guy at a donkey show. | Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime, that‚Äôs why I‚Ä¶jerk it on company time! | No....it's not.

It's gross.

Do it at home not in a professional space. | Or it | Taking notes on the distinction here | He fixes the cable? | My grandma is in intermediate stages, she called my mom in hysterics because she was in the basement and couldn't find her way out. Except she was in her one bedroom apartment which doesn't have a basement. | oh..  well i missed it (and still do) :( | But there‚Äôs absolutely nothing positive that can come from keeping them, literally only harm to the employee & the company can come from it.

I‚Äôde like to imagine if a Dutch company had explicit photos of an ex-employee saved in their systems, and they got hacked & shared, the courts would absolutely ask ‚ÄúWhy did you still have these photos saved in the first place?‚Äù. If not that‚Äôs a pretty lousy court system.¬† | I don‚Äôt even think they have to think that far, I feel like the company eliminated a liability for themself and the employee in the best interest of all parties.

Like if they were that employee do you think they‚Äôd want that clip/those photos floating around the office, potentially leaking into the local industry and having to worry about people at their next job seeing them?

IMO they just automatically side with and defend employee vs. employer without actually thinking anything through.¬† | Okay. But you can't accidentally tell an offensive joke at work. It's done deliberately, and if someone overheard it and felt intimidated by it, then it was done with reckless disregard to others.

Likewise, you can't be accidentally nude at work, unless someone stripped you naked by force, and in this case I think it would be a sacking offense for whoever did that. You wouldn't sack the nude person. | Well, it is tagged NSFW! | Yeah, I'd say this is a pretty safe case | Oh, I BE COMING. 

The name‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Coming, 
ADM. I.B. Coming. 
And these are my seamen. | IKR? Isn't that kind of the goal? | You‚Äôre a waiter- where did you get a badge and a gun? | I haven't watched the Simpson's in a few years either, so you will have to remind me of that reference. | Hahahahahah | This new DNA glaze smells fishy. | Boss makes a dollar I make a dime, that's why I cum on company time. | Joke's on you, I work from home! | Facebook is gross too, but I don't see anyone shutting them down. | Another reason for remote work | I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through that. I know it may be hard, but it may be time to look into assisted living. My grandfather has since passed, but before we got him into a facility, he almost burned the house down by leaving a towel on the stove. | One of my aunts is going through it right now. She recently fell and being in the hospital has made things a lot worse. My brother was over there yesterday and she was telling him all about something she'd just accomplished and how excited she was to tell our mom all about it. Our mom's been dead since 2008. | Well, yes, they should an probably would be deleted, and no one in their right mind would put them anywhere. But suing the company for that? Naaa. Not a thing, what would you get for that?  
I'm not really sure someone would be fired over here for that. The humiliation¬†might make them leave by themselves, though. | i didnt say keep em.  Maybe we have different definitions,  But for me theres a big gap between between ""pressing delete"" and ""Call IT to scrub your system"" | Whether intentional or not, nude images were revealed in a professional setting displaying a carelessness that most companies would find as a threat to their insurance rates. Most unsafe acts are dealt with impunity in company settings over that fact alone. | well, I brought the badge from home | Read it backwards | Need to leave a bowl of fruit next to the water cooler and coffee station, should solve the problem | I truly appreciate the concern, her apartment is on the grounds at an assisted care facility. She's in somewhat semi-independent care right now, because that's what she needed when the decision was made to move her there, but they're waiting for a room to open in the memory care area. 

It was brutal getting her out of her house, but she'd be dead by now if she was still there. | Backwards, IT is about some kids who bring back an evil clown, stop having sex and then the clown brings a bunch of other kids back to life. Nothing about the Navy. | I‚Äôm so glad she‚Äôs being well taken care of. Any bit of independence goes a long way, so I‚Äôm glad she is still able to have her own apartment. I wish you and your family all the best as you go through this journey! My grandma did not have dementia, but just passed a couple months ago. I happened to see her just a few hours before she died. Cherish the moments you have with her! It can all change so suddenly."
What have you lost interest in?,"Binge eating. It‚Äôs not worth it, regret it every time. Stopped doing it, happy now. | Star Wars. I grew up with the franchise, but I don‚Äôt care anymore about the 2-5 new Star Wars shows they publish every year. I‚Äôll rewatch the animated shows, but I don‚Äôt need the other shows. Same thing with marvel. Since end game and guardians of the galaxy 3, it feels like marvel is done. I don‚Äôt care about the new stuff. | [removed] | Almost everything. | Drinking. 

I tried not doing it for a month, didn't miss it and now im on month 3 without even being bothered.. | Buying collectibles. 

As a child of the late 80s/90s, I was hooked young to think there was real value in overproduced paper and plastic crap. That continued into my adulthood when I‚Äôd get collector FOMO too easily and buy the newest thing to buy with rare drops and then leave it unopened in a closet or shelf somewhere thinking ‚Äúthis is going to be worth so much some day.‚Äù

Well, I‚Äôm in my mid 40s now in a cluttered house full of mostly useless plastic crap and paper (posters, comics, art prints, books, games, pins) and only a small percentage of it is stuff that even makes me happy to look at or own. Anything worth any money is only slightly more than what I paid for it, and if something is worth real money I wouldn‚Äôt know because I have too much crap to price check to find out. 

Instead of spending thousands over my life on this junk, I wish I just bought the stuff that I really cared about and wanted to look at just for me in my lifetime, and saved or invested the rest of my money in real investments like stocks. 

If even one person in their 20s reads this, and feels trapped, like they have to buy every comic con exclusive or collectors edition or some overpriced hunk of crap, and realizes it‚Äôs the worst investment in the world and it breaks the spell, this reply will be worth it.

Only buy what makes you happy, pretend it‚Äôll be buried with you when you die, don‚Äôt collect things - make real investments instead. | Giving a fuck about what is going on in the world right now. | Getting to know new people.  I have been mistreated most of my life, and the desire to meet new people is lost. | Almost everything. Sad part is that friends I have known for a short time can see it without me saying why I‚Äôve lost interest in things. 
Only a few months left to go before I can start being myself again. | Star Wars. I used to LOVE that shit back when it was 3 movies and some dorky comics no one considered canon.

Now‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt care that much. Even the original trilogy, I‚Äôve got to watch it on grainy old laserdiscs to avoid the shitty 90s CGI‚Ä¶ rarely seems worth it.

At least the world got Mark Hamill out of the deal? | Oh, just my will to socialize with other humans. It used to be fun, but now I‚Äôd rather converse with my plants‚Äîthey‚Äôre way less dramatic. | Living | changing for others |  Tired of endless scrolling on social networks | Maintaining social relationships. 20 years ago I was obsessed with what was going on socially, where the party was going to be, calling people just to talk and catch up. 

Now with a family, kid, etc it's just not really something I do.

Maybe once in awhile I try to chase down a friend to hang out. | drinking alcohol | I've lost interest in playing piano. which is quite sad because I was always so interested in piano and I was good at it.

I love music, I love writing it, hearing it, and supporting artists. But I despise going to concerts. | Eating, reading, movies, music, games, writing, lego, general upkeep of the house and myself.

Buuut it's coming back. My mindset shifted and I'm realising some things about myself, my situation and the people around me that's just.. making sense. So I'm regrouping, eating better, getting more consistent with my self care, looking up when I walk down the street, getting my vit D, making new friends, talking to those closest to me to keep myself sane and social.. it's still not where it was, but any progress is helping right now. By leaps and bounds. | Life | Finding love | Civility.

Trump/Republicans and his MAGA cult can all die. The sooner the better. | Pretty much everything that involves interacting with people outside my immediate family that lives with me.

Women and dating. | Living. | I've lost interest in seeking external validation. Focusing more on my own path now. | Sad to say this, but gaming.
I know I'm old but gone are the days when you could buy a game and enjoy it, play through it, and actually achieve the impossible of actually clocking it. Now you buy a game, and it's constant DLC's pay to have this character, you can only play this version when you pay for this upgrade.
I remember the thrill of unlocking that new character like Goki (Akuma) on street fighter of Metal Sonic for example you actually achieved it, now you just have to pay there is no other option.
The game cost you ¬£50 to ¬£70 and they you have to pay more to actually play it!
Games are now released unfinished more than ever constant updates some in the guise of DLC'S others come with a huge Day one release update some bigger than the original game itself.
I have my Xbox series X and my PC, and yet I find myself dusting off my SNES and my MegaDrive playing games that it is actually possible to play just for the fun of the game.

It's just a money making exercise as on most games the items are there they just want you to pay extra to have the privilege of using something that's is already there. | Being understanding | Interest in discussing someone else's life. | Society I guess.... | Football ‚öΩÔ∏è | Life | Movies. It's been decades. I don't think I have gone to see a movie in the theater since 2005. 

For one thing, TV has just gotten much better. It used to be shit, but as movies began to become cliches, nothing but Superhero movies and classic reboots, and became utterly predictable, I felt as if I had seen them all, even if I hadn't seen them before, where TV suddenly got REALLY good. Not sitcoms, but dramatic series. Things like Dexter, Breaking Bad, Shogun, Prison Break (the first 2 seasons anyhow), were much more entertaining. 

And the delivery method changed from cable to streaming, so Youtube became a primary platform for entertainment that wasn't so contrived and had awesome content to offer. 

This all put movies aside for me. I don't watch them anymore. When I do, it's usually old ones that I grew up with and like to see again occasionally. | Video Games. Not by choice, my brain just can't enjoy them anymore. | Life | Enhancing my knowledge. Which is sad because I know it's important. I used to follow the news, read papers, books, Wikipedia and video text, play quizzes - but now, it all seems too hard. I hope my brain will be different someday... | Capitalism.
I'm done with this shit. | Most/All of my usual hobbies.¬†


Most anime doesn't interest me anymore. Gaming feels like a chore. I've been keeping up with Magic the Gathering sets but the thought of actually buying cards and playing makes me preemptively angry. Same with D&D. I've started reading multiple books but lost interest in all of them. I've kept up my gym routine but I've lost enthusiasm for that too. I've been building and airbrushing model kits but I'm just going through the motions there too.¬†


Part of me thinks it's adhd, but the medicine is not coveted by my insurance, expensive, and typically unavailable. I'm also not a fan of how cavalier my doctor was with prescribing Adderall, it makes me feel like an imposter. | Overall, negativity. Life is way too short and too precious. 
Have a beautiful blissful joyful day üòä | Fifa World Cup. Having Qatar as host with forced labour, those acting fans to fill empty rows and overall soulless presentation was the low point where I accepted that the magic of past world cups is gone. | Twitter. It used to be so great for breaking news, gossip, funny and irreverent humanity. Now it‚Äôs an absolute cesspit | Star Trek, Star Wars and super hero movies. | Brazilian Jiu Jitsu

I fit the stereotype of being obsessed with leg locks as a white belt and quit as a fresh blue belt. The passive and technical style of BJJ didn't align with my preference of being ""grindy"" and explosive, although I know that there are plenty of practitioners with my approach. Subsequently, I started training wrestling and Judo, which I enjoyed way more. | being a kpop fangirl, reading stories at wattpad, writing stories/poems, dancing :< | Well... life, but it is getting better. | Racing | Almost every thing | Everything | Life | Competitive video games.  I used to play Halo 1/2 OG Modern warfare etc and was way above average. Now, I'm too old to keep with how fast the game play is. | To your ex, with whom we had a very difficult breakup | Philosophy. So much of it on here is just depressing and not doing wonders for my mental health. | I've lost interest in what other thinks. If i die alone but happy, so be it | Life: Romance. Work. Hobbies. | Other people's opinions. | Other people's opinions. | People | Life. | Watching movies | I never seem to be interested in anything in particular, it's often life that pushes me to have to move forward. | Staying in contact with people through texting (WhatsApp). I just can't do it anymore. Group chats with pictures and videos and conversations that I look at and just go; nope. This is not talking and interacting, it not real. I miss reallife interactions. People just dont have or make te time for it anymore. | Cooking‚Ä¶used to love it. Now‚Ä¶shreddies for breakfast and dinner. | Study. Actually I had never interested in studies. | College | I wish | Going outside at night to chill and have a peace of my mind, lost interest when i got a job, such good times | Hollywood movies | In improving myself. This year was the hardest year to battle. Everyday I hate myself for existing. | Generational gambling trait( I am 17) | A lot of things thx ADHD | A whole lot of stuff. The world is a messed up place. | All | Jerking off | Living | Pretending to give a shit people's expectations. Fuck 'em. | Until some years ago I relentlessly pursued the hobbies I chose, such as mountain biking, climbing, skiing etc. I was always up to date on the latest innovations, social media stuff, scene celebrities. I had goals for the season, I had a lot of opinions. 
Now as I am getting older, I still do all these hobbies and still enjoy them very much but it's gotten much more relaxed. I am no longer in a bad mood if I didn't ride for a week or chickened out of something daring I really wanted to try that day. I now hope my gear lasts just a season longer instead of selling it as soon as the next latest greatest thing is available. I just go out and enjoy the time. And to be honest, I think I have never been happier with all the pressure I used to put on myself gone. | Life. | Interesting things | Living | Animating in 3D? Theater? Literature? Drawing? But yet again I'm ADHD so uh... I go in spirals of interests. | The Dating seen. Too many greedy people. And all women think that they are right. | Gaming I struggle to enjoy it now can barely play it for 10 minutes | entering a new relationship, after me and my fiance broke up, i completely gave up. | Living | I had issues at my old job and was helped by a union maybe 10 15 years ago became a delegate and then became a union official wow it was a shock to see them more interested in pushing political agendas rather than helping people the first union I worked for was big in Socialism the second was just about getting more members and nothing else really turned me off them. | Life, honestly. | Myself. | American politics. Trump killed my interest back in 2016. I haven't been able to get back into it. I just don't care anymore. | Good question 
i just want to live my life in peace | ""going out"" as in going to a pub or bar and staying there all night. I still love a good beer and am actually a bit of a nerd for beer but I never drink to the point of being hungover anymore (or very rarely). | All things ""worldly.""¬† There is nothing but destruction and sorrow in following the ways of the world.¬†¬† | Friends | drawing. i havent drawn for over a year and i was pretty good at it, but i had a lot to deal with so i stopped, and ever since then i have had no inspiration or motivation, and the times ive tried again the drawings sucked so bad. at times i feel like im wasting potential and instead im scrolling on my phone every free moment | Sadly these days it‚Äôs starting to feel more like a grindy chore than a fun hobby. I have a hard time finding a game that can keep my interest for very long. | her | [deleted] | Harry Potter. I don't know, I'm 2o years old and used to like it a lot. But it seems like that for me, the magic is gone. It's kinda sad. | Chasing unavailable people | Life. | The ones that really annoy me. | Anything Star Wars, Marvel or Lord of the Rings. | my love | A lot of things. | Meeting new people | Fashionable shoes, I just want to be comfortable. | Wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúlost‚Äù but definitely not as passionate about: video games.  Still play the occasional AAA game.   

Due to supply issue and price, I STILL don‚Äôt have PS5/XboxX

All that being said; I lm still eager to play Spider-Man 2 | Reading through the comments there are two thoughts that strike me.

One is about movies, games etc. There is no scarcity any more. Everything has sequels and spinoffs and clones and copys. There is such an abundance in things that you dont really get to ""bond"" with a game or movie, for lack of a better term. When I grew up there were three Star Wars movies. Now there are....I dont even know. When the new super Mario game came back in the day I went to the shop just to look at the cover, anticipation my birthday when I might get my hands on it. When the jurassic Park trailer came I was so excited I nearly wet myself. When the actual movie came and I got to see it in a full movie theater, I was numb with excitement. This doesn't happen any more I think.

The other thing I see in the comments are people who lost interest in their hobbies. I think this has a lot to do with work. People drain themselves at work and spend their last fumes on their family. Nothing left for anything else. I find this sad and disheartening. I'd tell you to try and pick of the paintbrush or guitar but I know how hard it is. But if you are able, try. Some things need doing to grow back. | make money online | Sports. I was down to only caring about football. College is a greedy joke now. Pro is OK but I am find that I really just don't care. | Films | I'm satisfied being aliiiiive-

I lost interest in losing weight, I just stopped caring | Life. | Being broke. | I think I have lost interest in time and even in my future. | Staying up past midnight. | Talking to people. | Currently... Rings of Power season 2 | Women.

Dancing. | I lost interest in drawing a couple of years ago. Maybe I‚Äôll pick it back up again, who knows.¬† | A show called LOST. | Gaming.  Mobile tactics of nickle and diming people  has ruined it. | AskReddit | Sportz | Reading, I don‚Äôt read anymore, none of the books I‚Äôve seen really appeal to me and if they do I never have the time to pick them up because I‚Äôve got other hobbies and general personal care etc | Life. | Lot of things man i used to love doing photography and i was very creative at that but now I just don‚Äôt know what happened to me, feels like evryday is a same day and I don‚Äôt remember what something different happened in the past 5-6 months.waiting that someday life will change and I‚Äôll be happy. | Men and dating and even the thought of marriage | Sounds like anhedonia. I‚Äôve been suffering for about 2 years. | Speaking, explaining myself. | My home country. Here's hoping that my next home welcomes me, because I need to get out of here | Dating men | Music. It made me so happy in the past, now i just can't listen to any song nor even my fav artists. Everything i listen to sounds so suddenly bleak | Life | TV and movies | Weed | living | People | Pretty much everything, except my family | caring for someone. | Go to movie theaters, I rather watch movies at home now | I‚Äôm a classically trained musician and went to college studying music performance for 2.5 years, then I just dropped out and now i‚Äôm studying cyber security. I don‚Äôt think music was the right path for me. | Sex.

I just don't care about it. I'm 35. Married. I'll do what I can to make my wife happy. But I just don't care about sex. I'm not interested in other people either. I love my wife. I wouldn't cheat on her. It's just not important to me. | Almost Everything‚Ä¶.43/m | The national debt.  Politicians will not address we are living on borrowed resources. | Everything | Myself | Most things | Dating. I‚Äôm tired of attracting people who don‚Äôt know what they want, and there‚Äôs not really a good pool where I live. I‚Äôd rather be alone. Going on bad dates constantly is exhausting. | My family. 
Not my wife and kids but my siblings. 
Just have no want/need for them in my life. | Love. Due proceedingly unpure relationships i have witnessed. Sometimes cheating, sometimes incompatibility etc. but what i dont tolerate is not staying true to your feelings. If u love the person youll know. Not that something will get in the way. Like impulses to cheat or some kind of mental disease preventing u from improving. Im gonna be honest with myself atleast. People can do what they put their mind to. But if they wont put their mind into even the smallest things to do better. Then ill expect nothing more in a relationship as well. Same as with myself. I want to improve and then one day pass on my lifes experience to my offspring as well or well atleast fun little stories. I dont have to be successful or anything else really nor does my partner. But the small little thing i want is what i just mentioned before. A simple but honest desire. | Most people and people stuff. However, my dog and the rest of nature are fantastic. | Having a large friend group.

It just never works long-term imo, and feels more for the sake of appearances than anything else honestly

Ive always been a ‚Äúquality over quantity‚Äù person but it‚Äôs taken on a whole new meaning to me as I‚Äôve gotten older | I used to be really into collecting physical media like DVDs and CDs, but with streaming services and digital downloads, I've lost interest in building up a physical collection. It's just so much more convenient to have everything online. | Surfing.. thankfully actually..it ended up being like a.job..gone 8 hours a day | My PhD | Carrots and Game of Thrones. | Though I've lost interest in alot of things, I've lost my drive to draw most of all. I keep making excuses for myself that there's not much room on my table for my screen tablet to properly draw on the computer anyway. But when I simply draw in the traditional way, I keep getting frustrated how many mistakes I made that I didn't see until I ink my base drawing and I didn't want to draw the whole thing again. It feels suffocating. | Being handed ‚Äúsoft rejections‚Äù- stop acting like an HR manager and just say it with your chest. | Reading. I used to be obsessed with it in middle school. Getting a smart phone took away that drive completely and now I have to force myself to put it down and pick up a book. | sadly, reading books. want to pick it up someday | Pretty much all social media. My phone crashed, couldn‚Äôt access it for a week, not interested in tiktok nor instagram anymore. Reddit all the way! | I wish I was brave enough to end my journey. Things seemed a lot more simple before I chose to touch down. | my commute | Turned 45, couldn't bring myself to front a cover band anymore, even though we were literally the best one in our city. I just felt....too old and a little embarrassed even though we still drew crowds. I didn't feel good about performing anymore. | Entertainment in the form of video | I‚Äôm more worried about who I‚Äôm losing interest in and what that means about me. I‚Äôm getting older and at 38 it seems like I‚Äôm grasping desperately to keep some people in my life, while‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. I need to journal this is not the place. | After 20 years of working in IT, reading about and studying technology.  Doing more on the business side of things makes me want to deal with it less and less in everyday life. | My mortgage. | Entertainment, sweets, friendships, work, and living in general | News channels. It just feels boring, wrong and dumb right now. | Life | Changing the opinion of other people. Self realisation is the only true realisation | Trying to please people where I lost my self in the process. I wish I could turn back time. | Every. Single. Fucking. Thing. | Playing online games specially pub g | Life? | Being depressed.  Being happy is a lot lighter | Sex | Engaging earnestly with people online. Scams, blackmail and extortion are so commonplace that it seems increasingly unwise to say much. | Decorating my house. I get why some seniors have colors from the 90‚Äôs. | Sports | Life | Curb your enthusiasm | Dating, finding a life partner. | I've lost interest in following every new trend just because it's popular. I used to jump on every bandwagon, but now I prefer focusing on what genuinely interests me. | The gym. I find it really monotonous so I‚Äôve taken up tennis now, but not sure it will get me the results I want | Sports. I used to be so passionate about them and now I just don‚Äôt care. Just the grind of life I guess and the perspective that comes with it. | Going to see new movies at the theater. 

I don't think I've seen a good one since 2020 (exception being Oppenheimer). | Celebrity relationships | Folk music. | People | Life | calculus :( | Life. Everything. | gf | Commenting, so many times I start typing and just | I'm not at the point just yet, but the city I live in is going downhill. The city's priority is these loser bike lanes, but they're not addressing homelessness, poverty, rat infestation, rising crime.¬†


The DOT fixes everything except the roads. | meet new people | Pro Wrestling | Porn | haven't lost yet but I'm losing interest in gaming smh,
I just don't feel like enjoying it anymore | Kpop, multiplayer games | Democracyüò≠ | Once I hit 30 if I get invited to something after 9pm there's an almost 100% chance I'm not going to that thing. | New phones. I used to be really interested in the specs and such, but that is gone now completely. I just want quality and something that holds. And isn't worse than my current one that I have had for 5 years | The way life has gone over the past few years has driven away motivation. I used to work and be able to do a lot of things like buying the groceries/food I enjoy making, being able to go to a movie or out to dinner.  Maybe take a couple of weekend vacations each year. However, I am working the same amount and making about the same amount but can no longer afford small luxuries. I am starting to lose interest in life as just surviving in this economy has become a day to day struggle. | Everything. Except the current hyperfixation (whatever that may be at any given time). | Politics.  Especially who is going to be the next president.  The way I say it is I'm fucked either way. I'm too busy trying to survive. | Dating | Shugo Chara - Finisheed Season 1 and realized I just can't really do long shows like I used to and this one is 102 episodes

  
Might pick this one back up in February and do it 1 episode a week for S2 (Which is what I'm currently doing for DokiDoki Precure and it's working really well there) | Looking for a job. I'm not lazy or disenfranchised, it's just that I've had to do it once already this year, and I'm just kind of tired. I'm trying to stay on top of it so it doesn't bite me in the ass down the line, but I'm not going to lie, I really could give two fucks. I'm actually okay being jobless. I'm happy.

The only thing potentially motivating is that getting a job around November/December time is fucking impossible. But then negative reinforcement is not working on me anymore, that time has passed. Positive reinforcement isn't really working either. The whole shebang of starting in a new place, picking up responsibilities, pretending to give a fuck when I really don't... Maybe getting a job will be easier than I imagine, but I'm enjoying the down time, I really am. 

Lost my most recent job so suddenly. Was told in the last 15 minutes of my day that we were going through budget cuts, and that I didn't need to come in the following day. In hindsight I probably should have, it would've made long term sense. But I just stayed home the next day and never really looked back. I hadn't even lasted 3 months. Now I'm joining the pool of 6,000 public servants laid off this year now. This is my second redundancy this year and I'm exhausted. So yeah, just happily existing and chilling in my world, living day by day in uncertainty has been bliss. A breath of fresh air. I might just get a job at a gas station, fuck career aspirations (I am still going to study for my dream job next year) but for this year, I really don't give a fuck. 

On a side note, the hospitality industry is suffering for the first time in such a long time which is music to my ears. Sorry to everybody in that industry, but fuck that industry. The only good thing to come out of the recession. That torturous industry can go screw itself now, how does it feel to suffer? | The job market for my profession. I have spent 15 years in database software, and it is really hard to find legitimate work. Job boards are all filled up with scams.. | Hustle culture. Social media. | Everything ! | Humanity. Not even joking. Better to care about my own life, because year after year it seems that the commom people will be in the consequences of all the shit being done to the environment (and economy) | love/relationships | Everything that doesn't involved me or my family directly. | I've lost interest in everything‚Äîmy social life, hobbies, my degree, and even people. It's concerning now because I have no energy to perform basic daily activities. I'm addicted to screens; my daily screen time goes over 10 hours. It sucks because I always end up with a headache. I want to regain my spark and get my life back on track. | Thankfully short videos. I had to put my self into ‚Äûrehab‚Äú a.k.a delete all apps that allow short videos from my phone. 

Now I don‚Äòt even think about that stuff anymore. Thank god! | The overall goodwill of humanity. I used to be such a ""we'll pull ourselves up by our bootstraps"" kind of guy until I realized that the people preaching it are simply manipulating those compliant, and the people who truly make a difference are treated as completely expendable. The analogy drawn in Animal Farm by the horse, Boxer, is damn near perfect. The 'work horse' types give their blood, sweat, and tears because they believe in impeccable ethic and perfect product being the metric of success. As soon as Boxer is injured and no longer fit to work, however, instead of a well deserved retirement, he is sold to glue factory and melted down. Companies are all too eager to do the same to retiring employees, and even current management if they can save money by replacing a manager with someone younger at a lower salary. It just creates no incentive to go up the chain, especially if the only degree of safety is basically at the top. I still think the lack of investment in Human Capital is the greatest tragedy in the advent of a modernized, globalized, tech integrated economy. | Politics. Global warming. Fake food | Men. They are criminal. | NFL | Trying to get people to hear my perspective or side of the story. 

If they care, they will ask. If not, I let it go. People willing to believe the worst about me, are not meant to be in my circle. Let me focus on people that believe in me, and encourage my growth. 

I've ""lost"" a lot of relationships this way, but quality of the ones I have now, more than make up for it. | Life | Football due to over saturation.  It used to be something to watch on Sunday and a big Monday night game.  Now, it is Thursday, Friday, Sunday, and Monday.  Then later in the year, they add in Saturday.  The off season is constant crap about drafts, combines, and anything else they can throw at you.  It has actively made me hate the NFL. | getting good. | Living. | Men behaving badly. In life and in entertainment.¬† ¬† | Social interactions | All the things that used to fill me with so much joy. Now I just constantly scroll on my phone all day & am so uninterested in everything. | Being a sad, out of shape nerd. Im grinding the gym and im gonna be a less sad, in-shape nerd soon enough | Life üòÇü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | Probably most things I enjoyed since 4 years ago. I guess music is the only thing I enjoy at this point and hiking & kayaking. It's so peaceful and really helps my depression. | Bmx | Being a people pleaser and seeking validation from toxic friends and family members. I went no contact with my entire family since last December and I have been stress free ever since. | MMOs, multiplayer games. | Video games and it's depressing. | People, as in the general public, gossip, small talk. | Voting. Both parties whole campaign is ""fuck those guys"" and all I want is to be able to afford rent. | My boring life | Going to concerts. When I was in my teens and 20s, that was my favorite thing to do. I just can't be bothered anymore. | Fan groups and fully reading entertainment news articles (they're written pretty crappily). | Pointless conflict and antagonism.  I'll try to make them see reason, but if I fail early on I'll just disengage. | Video games. They were better 15 years ago. And you bought the game and owned it. They don't excite me anymore | Everything. Thanks, stress & depression. | My job and career aspirations. My current job as an engineering manager has been so slow lately and is likely going to have a very slow period for at least a year, and may never recover. But it's the type of job that I thought I always wanted, I work with great people. I can't picture myself doing the same job at another company and liking the culture. I keep thinking about just doing something completely different, like being a bus driver part time and then getting certified in something, maybe in the medical field. | Waking up each morning. | Games. Of course, I keep playing, but it's always the same thing that bores me. It seems like you've drunk the game, you're having fun playing, but then it gets boring. | Life | Pretty much all TV and most movies. Most of the things released today cannot touch the classics.

I‚Äôve been filling much more of my time with books and outdoor activities. This is a great trade off, I think? | Weirdly, and kinda sadly, music.

I got into a lot of what I really liked when I was an angry, angsty, lonely teen, but I just don‚Äôt feel a strong emotional connection to most of it, now that my life has settled down, as have my hormones. On the other hand, as I cruise on into my mid-40s, I haven‚Äôt found anything else that really speaks to the current me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôll still turn it up when Nirvana or Garbage or Alanis come on the radio, but I just can‚Äôt be bothered to set up a Pandora or buy a Bluetooth speaker or otherwise go out of my way to have music in my life.

Anybody got any suggestions for music discovery for former angsty alt-rock kids who‚Äôve grown up and think the world‚Äôs worth sticking around in for a few more decades? | Keeping up with the other peoples lifestyle. 

I want a simple life. Have a decent house, low debt, dance in the kitchen with my wife, and occasionally write books. That‚Äôs it. | painting! :( | Friends. Or people I thought were my friends. I still have my hometown besties. When you almost get divorced, you learn you can never trust anyone.  Once we figured out our marriage, it was tough but I learned not to be so trusting. I don't miss having a ton of friends. I am kinda of a recluse now though.  Both of us are. | Buying ‚Äúluxury‚Äù goods. I went through a 2 year phase where I spent all of my money on luxury purses just to impress my boss. Plot twist: she wasn‚Äôt impressed and now I‚Äôm stuck with expensive and ugly mediocre purses that I hate. It‚Äôs embarrassing to even admit that my mentality was on that level at any point in my life. At least I learned a lesson?? | American media. Its just gotten worse and worse and dumber and more manipulative. I try and watch movies for free online, popular movies, and I make it about ten minutes. 

There is something utterly predictable and painfully shallow about American mass media. | Dating. Been single 10 years, haven't been on a date in around three years. | people clinging to their misery and their fear with such resolve that it‚Äôs rendered them blind to pragmatism and deaf to hope. | I lost interest in wearing real pants. Sweatpants for life now; elastic waistbands are the real MVP. Who needs buttons and zippers anyway? | Football at levels above high school.

Just found out about the 1,000 block limit on Reddit. Losing interest in Reddit. | sick of r/memes | Milk tea | Golf. As soon as those entitled millionaires decided that they weren't rich enough already and took dirty Saudi money that was it for me. | Bullshit! | dating and love life... | Politics. I used to consider myself very politically active voting in the primaries and surrounding myself with information. Ever since the Trump presidency, I got tired of being called a communist and un-American for simply being slightly left leaning. 

Took a huge step away from politics and the news. If this election wasn't so important, I probably wouldn't even vote. I have grown very weary of the vast divide between right and left these days. | My job | Facebook¬† |  Life | Baseball | Reading books | Long Term Relationships | College football.   I gave up on NFL years ago | Video game interest is declining since I started working 7-6 regularly. | Pleasing everyone/caring about other‚Äôs opinion.  Very liberating. | Baseball. I was obsessed with baseball. Then 2020 happened and it ruined it and I just lost interest. | Video games sadly. I like some RPGs (Onimusha/ San Andreas is goated) but I find them so boring now.


I'll try a new console with fresh games at some point. | People, places, parking. | Romantic relationships with men | X | Sex. Being alive. Everything but cigarettes and streaming anime. | Modern gaming. It feels anymore that if you buy a new game, you have to wait six months for them to iron out all the bugs and *maybe* remember to play it again, and if you do, it's more often than not a 6 out of 10 mediocre experience.


I played Motorstorm Apocalypse on my PlayStation 3 this weekend, and I actually feel like that was time well spent compared to if I had played Overwatch, Cyberpunk or anything made within the last ten years. | Life, in general. Not that I plan on dying anytime soon, mind. More that, for as much as I may have been told that ""life gets better,"" it really hasn't. | Living but it‚Äôs not like I have a choice | Any sense of urgency. | Trying to date in my 30s. After my last 2 girlfriends...I'm good.. | I've lost hope that anything will change in the country because we've seen some horrors play out on our own soil and nothing is ever done about it. I have 2 small girls and I'm very scared raising them during this timeline. | The latest TikTok trends. They just seem so repetitive now. | Losing interest in everything esp living fr. | When I was a teenager and young adult, I was huge into baseball. I was in fantasy leagues and even monitored top minor league prospects to grab them for my fantasy team ASAP if they were coming up to MLB. I watched A LOT of baseball.

At some point, the game just stopped being important to me. I still watch a lot of sports, but pretty much no baseball. When I do watch it, I can't stay interested, and I can probably only name five or ten current players. | People | Dating | on Friendship | Gaming. Used to be the biggest part of my personality. | Hearing about my friends‚Äô lives. I‚Äôm just going through the darkest time of my life and I don‚Äôt give a fuck about annoying coworkers or awkward tinder dates right now. I know that makes me a selfish asshole but it‚Äôs how I feel | Applying for jobs. Applied to over 1500 roles last year (this year probably 800) in the tech realm after my layoff. Most no answer and the very few (like 6) that reached out and then ghost me.


I apply on LinkedIn, indeed and dice and monster. I ask for referrals always, I also apply on the company website and reach out to people on Blind (the tech app)

I am based in the West Coast and have over ten years experience but my luck is absolute crap. | The Oscars. I used to pay attention and passionately cheer on the movies and the people behind them I admired. It feels like they don't mean much anymore. | Music and life in general. Always coming back to the question, ""What's the point?"". Music used to be my escape, and now I feel it's too much, and I feel like I want space. Even from music. I'm convinced that it is always going to be like this and it suckss | Climbing that fckng Corporate Ladder. | Social media, fame, following other people's roles, pop culture in general | People. I prefer my own company now | I used to get excited for every new iPhone release, but now it's like, ""Hmm, cool, another camera lens. | I'm approaching the brink with college football. 

The longer we go with unregulated booster and NIL collective activity, endless conference realignment and TV networks calling the shots, the sooner there won't be a ""college"" aspect to it at all. It's all wildly unsustainable, so I have real concerns it is going to crash and burn in epic fashion if someone, anyone, doesn't step up and be the less greedy person to get some guardrails in place. 

Players *finally* get paid (legally, over the table), but immediately a bunch of vultures with more dollars than sense got involved, and are trying to drive it off a cliff. | Life. | Gaming | Obsessing over my body shape | Life | Everything, games, shows, movies, hobbies, being social, relationships, going outside. Just doom scrolling and staying high to avoid spending time in my own head thinking about how my worthless life is going nowhere and I don't have anything left in me to fight against the tide dragging me down. Death is the only interest I have anymore. | Other people‚Äôs opinions and judgements ! | I have lost interest in anything not gaining my sense of worth.  
I lost interest in kissing ass, and those expecting it. I lost interest in owning shit that don't actually make a change in my life.   
  
I lost interest in other people, especially  those I don't even know, or care about.   
I have GAINED interest in my family and those i DO care about. That parson I wake next to every morning is important, whatever crazy I have to go through to make him happy. I gladly do. ü§£ The rest of you sodders, I don't even consider. | People. | Movies in general | Social media, this election,‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..and video games. | Reddit | Social Media | I‚Äôve lost interest in binge-watching shows. I used to spend hours on end, but now I prefer shorter, more engaging content or just spending time doing something hands-on. I find I enjoy things more when they‚Äôre more interactive or involved. | The MCU | People


and marvel | Reading books because of tiktok | K-pop
I used to be absolutely obsessed early teens, it is very much just a phase. And now I've realised how unhealthy and absurd the thing is as a whole. | smoking | Buffets because I'm much more careful on the quantity of food I like to eat nowadays & feel much pickier on the quality of dishes at restaurants | I‚Äôve lost interest in reality TV. I used to binge-watch it regularly, but over time, I found it less engaging and more formulaic. I realized I was spending a lot of time on something that didn‚Äôt add much value to my life. Now, I prefer to focus on hobbies and activities that genuinely spark my interest and bring more satisfaction. It‚Äôs interesting how our tastes and interests can evolve over time! | for a few months I got really into power lifting, by month 5 I got to a level that most people take 5 years to get to. Looking at the world wide rankings I would've ranked some were in the top 100 for my body weight. I think at some point I just didn't feel like lifting that heavy, especially without a coach to tell me how not to destroy my body. | Not quite there yet but video games. I grew up with them, I remember when you got skins for playing the game but now? Everything has to be made money off. Its endlessly frustrating to see how everything has changed. F2P games are normalized and a lot of youth seems to embrace it more than hate it as they don't know any better. Corporations becoming greedy as all hell and there is no stopping them either. I am becoming jaded to a degree where I am not enjoying my hobby anymore and always think the worst off a presented game. Once in a while there is a game that makes me happy, like recently Astro. Last year was BG3. There are still gems I am not saying that there arent but the focus on creating these gems has dwindled and all they want is profit. 

This obviously goes for every god damn hobby lately. 

Fuck Sony, Fuck Microsoft and Fuck Nintendo. | Pretending to tolerate, or to get along with, everyone.

I don't want to waste my life with people who I don't enjoy the company of. Some people will pretend to be courteous to those they don't like, just because of politeness. I will actively avoid their company, and if unavoidable, will not pretend to be polite if they say something idiotically stupid (and not out of ignorance, but just objectively wrong opinions). | Explaining to men why their behavior or words are offensive or inappropriate. I used to believe their weaponized incompetence. But over time with a group of guy friends I realized that these boys who are the most know-it-all genuines in 99% of cases, but are suddenly struck blind when they've been offensive, they are not actually needing to be patiently educated about their actions. They can figure it out if they choose to. Hours of my life gone in these looping conversations where they just don't comprehend whyyyy?!? Now I just state my point once, at most, and let them figure it out even if they become pouty about it. | There is a fine line difference between being selfish and self centered.  
when you start to prefer your personal development over wasting time in anything else you automatically lose interest in everything.  
hanging out with friends, scrolling, social media everything. | Dating/Sex/Relationsips. Seems like so much work for so little. | DIY home projects | reddit!?!?!?!?!? At least losing it!!! | It almost sounds pretentious and I don't mean it that way, but ""conventionally attractive"" women are losing my interest.

There's a galaxy full of sexy out there, and if your GF is doing Aretha in the shower you already won at life. | Seriously?!?!? | Most of the unhappiness listed here is due to the appointed idiot!!! Think it is bad now, PRAY another 2020 doesn't happen!!! | For me it used to be a real problem. Thought I‚Äôd have to live with it forever. Mid twenties I just totally lost interest. So thankful | can you please tell me how did you stop? | Same, I like Star Wars but I'm probably not going to watch any new content (I'm happy with the SW Universe as it is) it feels like an overloaded Corellian Freighter | The Emporer being alive and well in a cave for the past 30 years or so just killed me. 

Not watched a thing since. | seems like you didn't lose interest in SW but just in the shitty stuff current media is doing. | You might want to take a look at Andor. It's pretty good and there is a scene with Stellan Skarsg√•rd that is truly epic. You'll know it when you see it. | I decided I am more of a fan of movies than the properties. If they make enjoyable movies than I will watch them. Don't really care about nerding out on lore. | I felt the same way about Marvel so I started reading and collecting the comics. They're so fun, especially if you focus on one run at a time and see it through to the end. My suggestions are Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty and Wolverine: Origins right now! | Same for me, but 10 years ago, when the cancelled the Extended Universe and renamed it Legends.

I couldn't stand for such arrogant disrespect. | I do not understand how anyone watches new SW or MCU.¬†

Just looks like the same thing on repeat.¬† | I'm a somewhat avid defender of the sequel trilogy, and I'm definitely of the opinion that it's overstayed its welcome now. Given how many of the shows and unreleased movies overlap with each other, and given Disney's propensity to cancel projects, it seems like they're perfectly fine recycling the same characters and storylines until the series just dies with the current crop of fans. The only thing I'm remotely excited for is the second season of Andor, thank fucking god they greenlit a second season along with the first, that shit probably would have been cancelled by now too. | Every property needs to evolve to stay relevant. Its evolved in to a different direction in which I don't enjoy. They got away from what the original core audience liked. I wasn't even a big fan of the prequels, I just liked them because of nostalgia, then I realized I that was the whole reason I watched. Now with the Acolyte I just didn't even watch. Canon breaking feminism its not the Star Wars I enjoy anymore. | For the life of me, I just don't understand why they didn't continue (with new actors in the roles, of course) by using Timothy Zahn's *Thrawn* Trilogy.  It was a near-flawless continuation from the original three movies. | I felt like someone switched off my love for the Star Wars franchise when I saw The Last Jedi. Have never before or after gone so fast from obsessive longtime love to not caring at all. That was the last Star Wars anything I saw | Star wars post disney buyout is unfortunately on average bad content. 

I cant recommend it anymore to people who havent seen it (yup there are those who havent, i know lol) | It sucks not being in a target demographic anymore. | Prequels, Originals and first two Mando seasons do it for me. Nothing against Clone Wars tho. | Agreed. I think the only Star Wars titles I've liked in the last 2 decades is Rogue One, Andor, Fallen Order, and Survivor. | You need a dopamine detox.

The world is terrible, our opportunities for improvement fading, everything costs too much, and my body hurts all the time.

My cats though. Love them to bits | Yeah, after I started working, I became very lazy. | I came here to say the same thing. | This so much and I'm not even want to sound edgier with that.

Just tired of everything | Well all l can say is if being ate out really gives you that greatest climax you love me lm a liz trapped in a man's body | Pursuit of dreams | Just take drugs then | Agreed man ! After COVID it was all downhill | It's easy to give up drinking, I've done it hundreds of times. | Good on you! I just passed 2 months sober after being a daily drinker for about 20 years, and I feel better than I have in a long time! | Holy shit. It's my 1 month anniversary being sober. To be fair, I didn't have a problem, only drank when there was a 'reason' like a festival or birthday. So I drank maybe 6 times this year. | Recently sold my 1977 Luke Skywalker Action figure and used the money to buy a hundred dollar memory foam travel pillow. 20 years ago that would‚Äôve killed my soul, but today I‚Äôm happy with the trade off. | I‚Äôm going to second this, wholeheartedly agree. Hard to add more insight since you nailed it all, but what I wouldn‚Äôt give to undo some of those ‚Äúrare‚Äù hunts and buys. 

Looking at boxes of unopened crap, not having time  or (having too much unopened crap) to sell said unopened crap, when it‚Äôs sold there is little profit (if any), and the regret / self loathing from making the original purchase begins to dominate the thought processes. 

What a waste it all ends up being. | Real. Feels like the powers that be are so self interested, the only way to survive is if you adopt the same mindset | For real dawg | same | I hear you. 

Also, people are no longer genuine. 

Especially with relationships, many just have an ulterior motive. It's so sickening. 

I've been thinking about it a lot these past months

I am focusing only on making acquaintances with people who will be beneficial to my career. And if I end up being friends with them, then that will be a plus. | few months left to go of what? | Loneliness is adictive | Please don't. | Don't. | and yet here we are | I‚Äôm in that life stage where half my friends have just started a young family and the other half are still dating/searching so no one‚Äôs really on the same page anymore. One half is super busy with little kids or new marriages while the other half is super busy jetsetting or doing random things. It‚Äôs hard to coordinate anything b/c our schedules just dont align anymore. | as someone whos friends are starting families marrying etc. i miss you guys, profusely | i picked up the slack for you | I drink a little just to knock the want both to enjoy what l love the most. | If u still care you can always watch people play on yt. This works for me to get hyped and start playing. | Ooh...this one hits me deep. I haven't touched my guitar in over a year. I absolutely loved playing it and I still want to play it. But I don't feel it enough to start playing again. I'm sorry, if this doesn't make much sense. | You do remember though. It is just like riding a bike. When you are ready to start again you will be playing piano like the last time | Maybe find another instrument for a while? I've played many instruments over the decades, some I lost interest in, sometimes I pick them back up later, sometimes they don't give me what I want out of it and try something else. | Maybe find another instrument for a while? I've played many instruments over the decades, some I lost interest in, sometimes I pick them back up later, sometimes they don't give me what I want out of it and try something else. | same, it was one of my earliest hobbies. I haven't draw anything in the past 4 years because of the lack of inspiration and energy. | Yup especially prepping and getting all the utensils out. Too much work | Same. I used to love to draw and do graphic design. Even had a small side hustle back around my college years where I got hired to design some club t-shirts, local company logos, etc. A couple of years ago, I started getting too busy to draw, but in the last year I sorta just lost interest and inspiration. I‚Äôve gone through creative ruts before, but this time it just feels like the well has run dry. Been going through some work stuff recently and we‚Äôre planning on a life change soon so I‚Äôm chalking it up to that and I‚Äôm hoping once we make these changes, I‚Äôll get re-inspired again. | people are the real animals it turns out | That's what people who care what people say about them say. | True beauty comes from your heart and is not seen, but experienced | Same. This is my face. Deal with it. Save so much money on makeup. | ""Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort"" | Ayeeeeee ü§ù | +1 to this, i dont have the energy or time to go through a game | Yeah, I'm like that with WoW. I only want to keep playing for the sense of community but I think I lost interest in the actual game years ago. Kinda makes me sad, WoW was a huge part of my life for a long time. | Yeah, I only play like, one new game every 2 years now. 

I have much more interest in getting older games to run off my PC. | Its the Pawn Stars version of democracy ""best we can do"" | You can say (write) that again |  It's interesting how our interests shift over time, like how some hobbies just don't hit the same as they used to. I think adulting and the responsibilities that come with it can suck a lot of the joy out of things that used to be fun. Guess we gotta figure out new ways to find joy in stuff, or just embrace the fact that maybe we‚Äôve outgrown some of it. | This seems to be a common thing I have seen people say and I'm not sure why but it seems lots of people lose interest as they get older (not sure if it is entirely just an aging thing or if there is other factors involved too). Same happened with me as I got older and am now late 30's. I still did have a very good time playing a few games in the last few years so I know I am not completely uninterested and can still get really into a game if I really like it. But it feels like those times are MUCH more rare. Over last few years I probably bought 40 games and only enjoyed like 4 of them (guardians of the galaxy, witcher 3,  disco elysium, no mans sky)....those games I enjoyed a lot and loved them....and the rest I had pretty much no enjoyment with... | It‚Äôs to be expected. Your interests change over time. You won‚Äôt get the same joy out of some hobbies like you used to. And perhaps it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre growing out of it. Believe me, I‚Äôm currently going through the same thing with anime. I used to love it, but now it feels like a chore to watch even one episode. | I have rediscovered music by finding smaller, fun bands that have a history but have not been overplayed. Music is more fun to me now that anytime in the last 25 years. I am discovering lots of great stuff I missed. | this story sucks (just kidding) | I'm encouraging you to keep going, even if you're not interested in it. If you're good at it, make it a daily discipline of doing it if you can. The emotions will always follow the action. Maybe not at first, but in time. Keep going, friend. | My God you are me. As I get older I find that:

Sports are meaningless wastes of time that are massive money extractors. I am OK with them though as people need something to do. But I personally just don't care. I think it is a combo of the greed and the predictable, boring media surrounding sports.
 

Friends aren't really FRIENDS. They hang around because of shared interests. As people age they want to do less and less. Friends I looked at as the most important relationships in my life at a younger age are now falling to acquaintance status. We see each other twice a year - and that is because I pursue them.

Dining out is bad. Most food is right off the back of a Sysco food distribution truck. Good, but unhealthy and predictable. The expense is a lot, and the tipping is out of control. I avoid eating out and I make stuff at home.

Many women in America are way too arrogant. They think Being fat is somehow healthy and beautiful. Fashion consists if sweatpants and gaudy phrases on oversize shirts. So sick of fake everything. I have seen enough tattoos and piercings to last a lifetime. You are not showing how unique you are, you are showing you are a slave to the crowd. | that is a LOT of commas , go on girl | >Civility.  
>  
>Trump/Republicans and his MAGA cult can all die. The sooner the better.

You get the irony of that statement, right? | the liberals of today are terrible people

-- janet | You gotta be kidding!! President Trump was the best thing for our country!!! Just look at the shape we're in now..YOU LIKE THIS!!?!?!??! | For me, I always end up thinking about some annoying mechanic I do not want to deal with and it totally puts me off the game. Problem is, every game has this issue for me lol. It all just feels not worth the effort. | Ruined games for me, stopped playing video games for like 2-3 years, started back just playing games I enjoy and now enjoy them again.

Many times I would find my self playing games I wasnt enjoying purely to get achievements. | Huh, I read that as ""masturbating while shitting"" for some reason.  Odd. | Sometimes I step back and marvel at how badly Kathleen Kennedy and Disney blew up what couldn't really have been blown up. 

Jeez, the Sequels were giant turds. | Very well described. The gaming industry has become unbelievably soulless and toxic just like so many industries in todays modern age because of society elevating the most ruthless psychopaths/sociopaths that exist to high positions in every industry and put a giant trust in these piece of trash oligarchs and corporations. We are living in some of the worst of times. | If you think you have ADHD you should at least try to find a self-help group or something like that. I know some people that get through the day pretty good without medication. Even only knowing if your problems come from ADHD could help a lot with your self worth and starting with self acceptance. 



To me it sounds like you could be suffering from depression caused by undiagnosed ADHD, since what you describe reminds me a lot of myself and other ADHD people I know. The lack of dopamine makes it so hard to keep up with old hobbies and draws you into depression very easily. | people pushing politics at a job is better than everyone being fired at a job though. There are many sociopaths in the world who hold lots of power and should actual hold no power if the world was just that take extreme pleasure in firing people. There is a reason unions exist and people want them. | Hire a lovely maid to keep you company with the money you making at home. Problem solved. | I feel this.  I'm sorry, I know how tough it is.  I am struggling to make it to my 1st scheduled  psych appointment next week. | why is it unhealthy? | Same. I was into it before it blew up so before all these new groups came out. I was listening to 2NE1, SNSD etc. It was just a phase tbh I personally only know 1 person who‚Äôs still into it beyond the age of 25.
To me it‚Äôs like still listening to Justin Bieber, One directions or 5SOS. | Give me one good plate of pasta over a mediocre all you can eat any day | The fake drama and staged scenes in ""reality shows"" is just the worst. Once I found out shows like Jersey Shore and Pawn Stars were staging everything I just quit watching any of those type shows | congrats on your progress but i promise you you werent top 100 in your weight class

-- janet | It‚Äôs an over saturation of shitty new games. ¬†Like you mentioned there are still plenty of good new games coming out, but in multiplayer it‚Äôs just a bunch of F2P crap that has incredibly boring gameplay when you don‚Äôt care about the constant skin drops.¬†

I knew things were bad when the chief complaint about Halo Infinite as the fact is wasn‚Äôt dropping new skins every other day. ¬†The game itself is fine, not as good as some of the older titles but fine, yet all the online complaints are about a lack of content drops. ¬†

People have forgotten how to be happy with what they have | Both men and women can be equally offensive and inappropriate

that being said. Some people can also be way too sensitive and judgemental about what is and isnt inappropriate

I dont know what circumstances you think are or arent inappropriate though so i dont have an opinion on whether i think you are going overboard in correcting people (like a person who goes to a stand up comedy show and gets offended by ever joke the comic says)....or if you have reasonable reasons to be offended...

just my take about it.....but if you seem to be having this issue constantly and you think it is only just men this way I think you might be being possibly unreasonable and too judgy. People get annoyed when people are constantly being offended by everything. In my view you should only be offended if it is something extremely awful such as making fun of a handicap person with the intent to hurt them | Same here, after turning 25 my gastric tract just said ‚Äúwe ain‚Äôt doing that shit anymore sis‚Äù. 

When I was a teenager being super full felt so cathartic, but now it feels like I‚Äôm dying. | I need to know also | The cash grabbing makes me only interested in what I consumed when I was younger. I didn‚Äôt need Moon Knight. | Whhaaaat?   Where and how?  Shit spoiler üö® alert | I didn't bother seeing that movie and I don't think I ever will. | It‚Äôs ok, but it‚Äôs not the masterpiece that everyone makes it out to be. ¬† | How would someone go about doing this? | Just an FYI, but the account you replied to (Suburusushi121) appears to be a kama-farming bot that can only copy and paste other people's stuff.

Despite the current conflicts, the world is more peaceful than it's ever been. We have better access to knowledge, entertainment the opportunity to travel, to experience new things and it's easier to keep in touch with loved ones.

Everything being too expensive is certainly dependent on your income and where you live, but there's plenty of awesome things you can do for free, or nearly free. 

Your body hurting will be dependent on your own situation, (I hope that it's not a serious medical situation) but good diet, sleep and exercise will keep 99% of us in good health for the majority of our lives, barring disease or unexpected injury. | Do it for the shit rats | I agree üíØ with everything you sed hear | Damn ... sucks to be you, wow. | Same, I used to enjoy gaming every night but recently I've lost interest in it. It feels like an obligation now. | We only have so much mental discipline to spend each day. Work consumes me so much that it is hard to have the mental fortitude to then come home and do all the necessary tasks at home. 

You're not lazy. You're just spent. | ‚Ä¶ wait a minute | Fvck Luke Skywalker ...aint never did sh!t for me | The worst part is finding out the vultures who are selling it to you and how they are all deceitful evil people (atleast most of them are) | Before things in my life can start changing in a positive way. | Hopefully the appointed idiot!!! We can climb back up on top once again!!! | Thank you for showing some concern. I'm not suicidal, just going through a rough phase in life. | This brings up a question I‚Äôve wondered about for quite some time and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs unpopular and i‚Äôll get downvoted, but I really would like to hear an explanation‚Ä¶ But why is it so universally recognized that saving someone who hates living enough to commit suicide considered noble? On one hand you have someone who loves life and couldn‚Äôt imagine killing themselves telling another person who has a trauma too unbearable to live with not to. Like what are they going to do besides say, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do it, things will turn around, life is precious‚Äù. Are they going to take calls from the person everyday who is living a nightmare? Are they going to deal with the outbursts (sometimes violent) of the person seeking respite and get them the help they need? Like if you‚Äôre pro-life when it comes to a child in the womb but unwilling to let your tax dollars be spent helping them when they grow up, I can kind of understand; it‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs life, and the kid being aborted would probably choose life 100% of the time. But then if that kid grows up and wants to nope out of life, we‚Äôre like ‚Äúno! Think of the people who love you! But I gotta bounce now, I hope you can find the help you need, oh and please don‚Äôt screw over anyone else along the way as you navigate through your personal hell‚Äù Just seems like hollow virtue signaling. | Username checks out | What kills almost every form of exercise, hobby or even socialization isn‚Äôt the effort of the task, it‚Äôs the effort of getting started. | God that's so true.. | ""Suffocation, no breathing

Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding"" | Meanwhile me in my 30s rediscovering WoW again after 15 years and loving every second of it. | I personally attribute it to our tastes becoming more refined (partially driven by more limited time).  

As kids, we have more time to consume relative slop happily. Can't afford to do the same now. | ok | I do loooove commas ü§£ | Touch√©! | You want more racism and sexism, billionaires above the law, pollution everywhere? | I have depression and I'm taking medication for it. Not saying this to be dismissive, I'm trying to add context. Just in case.¬† | Yeah but they aren't about that anymore its just get members and push the agenda i wouldn't join another one again. | The preasure on idols is dehumanising, they're put on awful diets, not allowed to date, workout hours a day, strain their voices, get horrid hate on social media, some debut as prepubescent children. It projects really unhealthy beauty images on young people too. Just not great. They shouldn't be 'idols' they should be looked up on for their music and dance. Nothing else. | Same,
I'm 17 at the moment and I still know the odd person but it just seems a bit odd at this point. Like the weird adults you'll see obsessing over an 18 year old idol. | Lol the movie came out 6 years ago.

I think we're allowed to talk about it now. | It‚Äôs a masterpiece compared to the rest of the shitshow that star wars has become üòî | There‚Äôs a bunch of YouTube videos and even a Ted talk that tells you how to do it. But basically retrain your brain. Social media makes you scroll and actually trains your brain for instant gratification and next next next, kinda your next happiness is just a swipe up and that easy‚Ä¶really interesting stuff if you get down to how bad/easy it does it to people.
[example](https://youtu.be/jCWADjUA9iI?si=dBkgvFXmZIUXjhKo) | Curious about the answer | install an browser extention that limits your time on a website. | ""Join Scientology""

this is how it happens...be careful | > How would someone go about doing this?

This is a very simple answer ‚Äì but leave your phone behind somewhere. 

In my case, I go camping once a year with my buddies. We have a secret lakeside camping spot we go to, it's pretty secluded. It's about a 10-minute walk from where you park your car to the site, so I just leave my phone in my car since cell-service is non-existent out there. 

For the next 3-4 days, we hang out, swim, drink, smoke and enjoy each other's company. I only see most of those idiots once a year (growing up sucks) so it's kinda nice to chill out and spend time with each other, not behind a screen. Nobody has their phone since there's no point. We stay up late and chat, wake up with the sun, and do it all over again. 

After even just a couple days I'm sleeping better, my attention span is back to the normal (I'm not bored constantly), I feel more relaxed and less anxious. 

Just leave your phone behind and fuck off in the woods or somewhere for a couple days. | Shrooms | Oh, do I feel this. | If this isn't a quote,  then you have a beautiful gift for writing. | This is beautiful.  I googled it, in quotes, and this thread the only result.

Is this paraphrased from somewhere?  Very poetic. | Thinking things is better is completely dependent on what you measure better by. People are less healthy than before. The wealth gap is bigger than ever. Your ability to have a decent quality of life is much more rare. Things in many aspects have definitely gotten worse year by year over the last decades. In my view things began going downhill when Nixon took office.

Many things are much better definitely but as far as overall much of the most important stuff has become worse. The fact that there are lots of people who still cheer on the elites and protect the elites after everything thing that has happened over the last decades and they drove us all off a cliff is simply crazy and a very depressing reality about mankind. | Try taking a break! Try a book or a show or going for walks instead and then come back when not doing it anymore is bothering you more than doing it | Maybe. 

But part of it is your brain literally rewiring itself as you age further into adulthood.

It‚Äôs not like kids aren‚Äôt put through the grinder too: School, homework, extracurriculars, etc.

They‚Äôre just more motivated to do things because they‚Äôre still young and full of hormones.

It‚Äôs just part of growing up. Life didn‚Äôt get worse. You just got older. | ""unsolved mysteries"" | Ohkay. Thank God | My take on it has been ‚Äúwe were all forced to be here, we should at least have a say on when we want to leave.‚Äù | This is a very profound thing you said, and only a handful of people saw it.  Pity. | Tududunununununu tududunununununu tududunununununu tududunununununu | I envy that. Enjoy! | Seriously?!?!? | Exactly.¬† I HATE THIS WORLD BECAUSE OF FRUMP | In what way has this been improved under Biden. ¬† If anything it‚Äôs worse | Whatever leaves more money in my bank account, money matters more than feelings. | Wait until you get royally screwed by an employer. You will find out the hard way why unions exist. You might get lucky though and it doesnt happen. Just saying, for many people it has, and that is why they exist regardless if some people find some annoyances with how some of them operate. | Yea.  But like this thread is saying, I stopped watching them years ago. I‚Äôm in that boat. | Man, I saw that movie and don't remember that at all | Wow that video makes it really easy to understand and the graphics keep you interested.  Thank you for sharing.  I will be sharing this with my friends. I do too much gaming on my phone and sugar intake, I am going to try the methods he suggests in this video. | Minimalist Phone App helps. I've been using that about six months. You can take up to 30 day breaks on certain apps. You have to be intentional with it though. There are always ways to break your own rules. | Well, in that case I choose to focus on what things have improved, and practise gratitude that I am living in a time when I can experience many incredible things, keep myself in good health and have a decent quality of life when so many in the past were not as fortunate.

Of course, it's very dependent on each individual's circumstances, but I'm willing to bet that 80-90% of the people reading this are living in a first world country, with access to running water, a roof over their head, plentiful food and no risk of their family members dying from curable diseases or war being on their doorstep. I'm fortunate enough to be in that 80-90%, and I am grateful every day for it. And by golly, I mean to take every opportunity and chance to enjoy living in this time, as well as help others to have a better life because I consider it to be pretty damn good. | Stop reading the news. A big wealth gap doesn't mean you have to be poor. Declining national health doesn't mean you have to be unhealthy.

I find that if I focus on improving my life, life actually becomes pretty awesome! It's selfish, but worrying about people you don't know doesn't help anyone. | They are a complete stranger, likely hundreds or thousands of miles away. Acting like you actually gave a shit is just disingenuous | The counter argument would be: we will all die eventually, why rush it? Those 80-100 years of life you've got are but a blink of an eye in the cosmic sense of time. | This is my last resort | With my experience as a delegate and official, I can represent myself for my own issues but i just think the best of unions is long gone. They can negotiate wages and conditions but for issues and representation they are shit now. | Oh lol. Well yeah he's absolutely fine. Been living in a cave for 30 years kept alive by tubes and shit.

It's absolutely surreal when you watch it the first time. My jaw was on the floor for the rest of the movie. And not in a good way. | The line was literally ‚Äúsomehow palpatine returned‚Äù and that was all we got | I suggest you go to the library and borrow something using a print medium format, like a book or magazine, to stay informed on the ""detox."" Or maybe switch to a desktop or laptop for a while to peruse internet sources. Using the device you're trying to detox from might be a little exacerbating. | You are living in a fantasy world ü§£ü§£ü§£ you had some good luck in your life....most of us are feeling like it is the end days out here and rightfully so

i cant believe you said that 80-90% line with a straight face....you are incredibly hilarious | Being emotionally depraved sucks. Insensitive, right? | I actually don't give a shit. But it takes nothing from me to say a nice word or two. 
And who knows, he might end up being my future husband and this was how fate wanted us to have our first interaction. 

Stop being so disingenuous. | well unions that are shit is an annoyance and non union jobs that are shit have ruined peoples entire lives and led to countless avoidable suffering and death | The whole story was honestly a complete crap show. When I saw the first one of the (the Force awakens) I thought they made some bad choices and that the character development was sub-par but I gave it a chance. I do think if they'd had some good storylines and better character development the trilogy would have been salvageable after the first one but it just spiralled out of control didn't it? The second two movies were just pure crap. They totally shamed Luke Skywalker - made him nothing short of comic relief then they made everything feel like a badly scripted RPG with subplots and a main plot but so that you have to do a lot of convoluted stuff just because and the total lack of logic in lots of the story... I think keeping the emperor in the cave for a couple of decades just suited every other bit of nonsense quite well in the end. | *Somehow* | Ah well, c'est la vie, eh? üòÇ

All I can give you is my experience with life, and it's been an awesome ride for me. I wish you well my friend üòä | >most of us are feeling like it is the end days out here and rightfully so

No, that is just people like you. Most people are happy. /u/goodeveningapollo is right, life is great, and things are getting better. It is an amazing time to be alive. | I appreciate the honesty at least.

What do you think disingenuous means and how was I being it? | Yeah it was just a convenient explanation in the third act (of the trilogy) to get out the door. They had zero plans from day one and just threw whatever at the wall and what stuck is what we got | Based on actual data you are wrong but okay keep pretending everything is a fairy tale. You sound like a Kardashian. | Lol. I just googled the meaning.

I feel silly now. | haha, no, actually, it is not. We live in an incredible time. 

Man, it must really suck to be you."
What's an argument you couldn't believe you had to have with an adult?,"Why two tablets of vitamin B6 do not equal one of B12... | I met someone who didn‚Äôt believe in space. Not space travel, outer space. Just didn‚Äôt think it was real. | I had to have a long chat with someone in their 30s about Mexico not being a US state. She was sure that Cancun was an American city because most of the people there were white & black Americans and not Mexicans. I asked how far outside the resort she had gotten and she said ‚Äúwhat do you mean?‚Äù | That bacon wasn't a vegetable. 

Had ordered a bacon cheeseburger at a fast food restaurant and asked for ""no veggies."" When I got the burger, there was no bacon. I went to the cashier to ask for the bacon and she just smiled and said, ""You asked for no veggies."" Thinking this must be a joke, I asked her, ""since when was bacon considered a vegetable."" With a completely straight face, she replied, ""It's always been a vegetable. My boyfriend and I are vegetarians and we eat bacon all the time."" | That average people know who Hitler is and what a Nazi salute looks like. They *insisted* I only could possibly know that because I'm ""into history"" and there's no way they teach the Holocaust in school | I once had to explain that going 60 miles per hour meant you would literally travel 60 miles in an hour to a colleague. We were both in our mid 20s at the time. I don‚Äôt know how they passed math class ever. | A coworker insisted Okinawa was a Hawaiian island and couldn‚Äôt be convinced otherwise. | With a 40 year old woman in South America.  I had to explain where babies came from.  She had like 17 kids and didn‚Äôt know why god kept blessing her with more children.  She just wanted it to stop as she had been pregnant pretty much her entire adult life.   I‚Äôm not sure if her husband knew or not. | ""STD's aren't real"" and also, ""I've had syphilis in the past"" from the same person. | Reindeer are real, I am not trying to convince you that there are actually flying deer that pull Santa Claus' sleigh. | Explaining to someone that a stop sign means stop..... | No joke, I went to pick up an item at the grocery store and it was labeled ""1/3 lb"" and an older lady tapped me on the shoulder and pointed to a competitive item next to it for the same price, but was labeled ""1/4 lb"".  She said, ""It's smarter to buy the larger package for the same price. Your wife would know that.""  She could absolutely not be convinced that 1/3 lb was larger than 1/4 lb.  Even explaining the math and showing her the weight in ounces on the package, she wasn't having it.  I just laughed to myself and walked away. | That Africa is NOT a country in and of itself, it's made up of many countries. A paraprofessional in my classroom started to argue with me as I was teaching my students about continents. She was trying to say that Africa is a country and I said Nooo, it is made up of many countries.  I had all the kids pull out their laptops and Google the countries of Africa. | That the 5th of July was not the 2nd Wednesday of the month.

After 20 mins I handed the call off to my manager and admitted defeat. | That dictionaries are better source of definition of words than twitter is.

They said western dictionaries are propaganda and can't be trusted for the definition of words.

Edit: Their point was not even the use of words in the general population of twitter users(which still doesn't represent the total population), it was the definition according to a handful of posts by some twitter accounts. | [deleted] | we live in Canada.... and we were on a road trip. we stopped to take a piss and a tumble weed comes rolling across the way. he tells me that  ""did you know tumble weeds come from Texas""  at first i thought i was a joke. but the guy was dead fucking serious. these things just tumble across 100000 of kilometers across the mountains and countless fences, river and lakes.  it was the dumbest conversation i ever had. and he's one of those guys that always thinks he right.  so me an all my buddies call him Texas tumbleweed Bryce. still do to this day. | I knew a lady who had two sons. 

We were visiting and I had to use the bathroom and I was on my girly time. Even though I wrapped it up you can see the wrap in the trash can. She approached me and started screaming how I was a whore out of nowhere. 

Long story short, she was under the belief that a woman only had a period if she was a whore. Because it was God's way of punishing a woman. I had to sit and explain to her that a period was a natural thing that women had and it was not some divine retribution 

Again, this was another woman. And she had two children which means she had all of her body parts. And obviously they functioned correctly because she had children. Which means she has had periods in her life 

She wouldn't believe me, just went completely wild screaming until I had to leave because she wouldn't stop screaming how I was a whore and my period was proof of it | That making hollandaise sauce with vanilla soft serve ice cream was not acceptable in this universe or any other. | Someone who was an ELECTED OFFICIAL at the time was completely unaware of the fact that the seasons are at opposite times of year between the Northern and Southern hemispheres.

Convinced that I was ""fucking with her"" when I tried to explain that Christmas is observed in the summertime in Australia, she took to google, confirmed the date for xmas being 25th of December, and decided that I was indeed full of shit... | I had an undergraduate university professor (subject: French) who would not, for the life of her, believe her students when we told her that a kilogram of feathers and a kilogram of stone weighed the same. It was a true or false question on an exam and she graded us all incorrectly on it. | That LGBTQ people are a hoax to keep women enslaved to men. She was around 30 or so and I was 15 at the time. So this women came up to a 15 year old boy(me) to ask if I knew about what men were doing to keep women enslaved. 

I have to admit it was quite entertaining | Met someone who believed he didn't need to brush his teeth because he had some gene that made his teeth have some kind of self-cleaning abilities. Apparently, the gene he was referring to actually just meant he was less susceptible to build-up than others may be. I argued with him about the general hygiene, odour, and his inability to get a date if he continued to avoid brushing. Thanks to this argument, he finally started to brush his teeth...at 24 years old. | A lady once called the cops on me because I wouldn't take her bottle return slips. I worked grocery stock and was nowhere near the cash registers. | Explaining to my 2nd grade teacher that Alaska is bigger than Texas and yes, the picture on the wall map is smaller, but that is because they are at different scales. | I once needed to actually give a lecture of poultry reproduction to a 45 year old man who was claiming that chickens are hermaphrodite and that they do not need to have sex to procreate üôÑ it was surreal | When I was a kid my neighbor had set cage traps for a possum that was tearing up his lawn at night searching for bugs, apparently. 

One day I came home from school and noticed a cat in the trap, obviously someone's pet as it was wearing a collar. I walk over into his yard to free it and the guy comes out and goes berserk as I was trying to let it out. I explained it was a housecat, which he could obviously see but insisted to keep it trapped. I told him to piss off or whatever and let the cat out. He continues to yell at me as I walked away and ignored him. Fuck that guy, 30 years later and it still pisses me off! | A pair of Marmots is not a Marmoset! | I had a grown adult who was in possession of car keys and (presumably) a wallet with money they earned through employment‚Ä¶ yell at me once that I was a ‚Äúfucking moron‚Äù because I was watering the plants for sale outside the grocery store I worked for.  When I replied that it was hot and we were making sure they stayed alive for people to purchase she said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too stupid to live. EVERYONE knows plants make their own water!!!

Um.  No? 

Before I could react, she got in her car and cut the wheel too much while backing up and ripped off her entire front fender on the concrete barrier beside the car ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | I had to argue with a woman that thought Africa was the center of the earth and it was a giant island... not connected to the crust... that just floated around and all life came from it and any humans that weren't African were gross malformations of genetics that the glorious people of Africa kicked out for being bad genetic code.

This is NOT a shitpost I swear to God this is a real converstion that I had with a woman who called me things like *rice rascal* (I'm fillapino) | my friend's boyfriend thought that she got her period because she cheated on him...he was saying that they hadn't had sex recently and ""all of a sudden"" her period started

I had to explain to a fully grown, 23 year old man, that periods are part of a menstrual cycle and most women have them in varying degrees, and are not a direct result of vaginal sex, afterwards it went something like this

""so where does the blood come from""

""tissue from the lining of the uterus sheds which causes the bleeding""

""so girls get their period after sex then""

""why do you still think that?""

""because you're penetrating the uterus""

""the vagina is different from the uterus, you're penetrating the vagina""

""I thought vagina was the word for how it looks on the outside""

and that's also how I found out (it became increasingly obvious with each new sentence) that this guy is a total idiot who doesn't know anything about the female reproductive system or anatomy | I was the dumb one. I had the ""ducks can fly?!"" realization after arguing with friends that ducks just sit in ponds and quack, quack, waddle, waddle only. | I argued with someone r/Aww that because male cats are mammals, they are going to have nipples.



He spent the entire day arguing that male cats don‚Äôt have nipples since they don‚Äôt breastfeed.




I went through his post history just to see if it was a shitposter, nope, it was a man working as a mechanic. | A friend of mine believes wholeheartedly that there are fairy people and giant people living secretly in new zealand, and that giant people were also the ones who built the pyramids.
He's convinced that he is actually a hybrid too, that he doesn't truly belong in human society.

He's 40. | My dad had to explain to my sweet mother that hamburgers were made out of cow meat, not pig meat.

Parent 2 was seething from the comment parent 1 made so when kid 1 touches kid 2 parent 2 says parent 1 needs to control their kid and the parent start to yell at eachother, when I address the adults as kids, ""Can we all act our age and I'll get you both out of here as soon as I can?""

To which parent 2 looks me dead in the eye and says ""She started it!!"" 

I responded incredulously ""How old are you?""  Thankfully that shut them both up and the kids picked their prizes. | This is going back quite a few years now. Back when I was in college, I had a teacher who was a flat eather... you can probably guess how that went. | My cousin was bagging his own groceries at Walmart, those bags are thin and weak as hell so he was double bagging. The check out monitor lady came up and said that he isn‚Äôt allowed to double bag, it‚Äôs too wasteful. He informed her that their bags were crap and that he didn‚Äôt want his groceries to fall out. Her solution was to take half of the groceries in that bag and put them in another bag. 

He explained multiple times that this would be using the same amount of bags but she couldn‚Äôt understand how that was the same thing. 

After awhile he just said F it and went about bagging his groceries | That bigger circuit breaker panel doesn't mean you are gonna have a bigger electric bill üòÇ. The client called and said that the circuit breaker panel is big and it's gonna use a lot of electricity and that's the reason why I need to replace it with a smaller size one. üòÖ | Not an argument, but I had to explain to a lifelong friend how to brush his teeth when we were roommates for a couple of years in our early 20‚Äôs. 

This is a guy who had constant dental problems since we were kids, and was a real concern for him so much that he would even express it to his friends at usually insecure ages. He swore that his dental routine was top notch ‚Äî and he genuinely believed it was.

It wasn‚Äôt until we became roommates and he had to have yet another root canal that I paid attention to his daily dental routine which consisted of him actually brushing for maybe 5 seconds and then walking around with a toothbrush in his mouth for the next five minutes while he did laundry, or found his work clothes, or wallet, etc, etc. In his mind he was truly paying attention to his mouth, but in reality he had not really learned how to brush his teeth until he was in his 20‚Äôs.  The one thing that probably saved him from it being worse than it was is that he flossed 3 times a day. | Got into an argument about the dozen different ways we know the earth isnt 6000 years old. It was unfathomable to him that it could be anything else, and he refused to even listen not just to any counter arguments... but to even listen to what the words ""scientific method"" even meant. Science was filed under ""a competing religion"" in his mind. | That I could not use photoshop to show the other side of a sign if I didn't have a picture of the other side to work with.¬† | Had an argument with a substitute teacher that you cannot add the last 2 digits of a number to 4 or 8 and it will always be divisible by 4.  She still argued with me that 12 is not divisible by 4 because the numbers added up to 3.

And just to clarify the actual rule to the minority of people who do not know, if the last 2 numbers are divisible by 4, the entire sequence of numbers is divisible by 4.  If the entire set of numbers add up to 3,6, or 9, then it‚Äôs divisible by 3. | When I was 10 i had a full blown argument with an adult that was trying to tell me Batman had super powers. ""He flies in the movie,"" she kept saying. The concept of gliding was totally foreign to her. | That washing with soap thoroughly after sex does not ""get rid of"" any stds you could have caught......no matter how fast you do it........grown ass man jfc | As a low level AV engineer, I was gobsmacked when I had to explain to our highest level engineer, with decades of experience in video, down to the component level - that a projector doesn‚Äôt project ‚Äòblack‚Äô. He just would not accept the ‚Äòblack‚Äô on the screen was the same as the ‚Äòwhite‚Äô that was there just before we turned on the projector. He had been installing these systems for countless years. | My mom once think that she knows the laws better than the USA government website and argued that it‚Äôs wrong
Me and my bf were looking up visa requirements to enter Vietnam on the official government website. It requires that since he‚Äôs not a Vietnamese citizen he needs a visa. My mom heard that and said ‚Äúhe doesn‚Äôt need one‚Äù and because the last time she flew foreigner didn‚Äôt need visa. Me and her argue who was right and she said ‚Äú do you want to trust me? Or do you want to trust the government website‚Äù | My roommate had a tendency to leave a poop smear on the side of the toilet seat.

The subsequent conversation was hard to have without using my speaking to a child voice. | With a nursing major. 

No maam, your blood is not blue until it is exposed to oxygen. It is LITERALLY an oxygen delivery system. | Drinking rubbing alcohol can kill the coronavirus bacteria and cure you.

You cannot believe how triggered I was, after hearing this. | A couple that I knew made fun of me for believing that Julie Andrews was British. I believed she was British because SHE‚ÄôS BRITISH. | That the first amendment protects both your right to follow any religion AND your right to abstain from it.  There are apparently people who believe that it only means freedom to follow a religion of your choosing, which is insane. | I was discussing the need for contraception with my brother and his wife if they did not want to have a child.  She stated she did not need to use contraception.  I said that she would, and she promptly replied ""No I don't, I'm infertile.  Just like my mother.""

To be fair, that stopped the argument. | A narcissist at the ripe old age of 35 and a self employed lawyer, told me he bought an expensive car because it ""would be taxes anyway"". I was only 21 and studying accounting and I had to kindly tell him that the taxes are a form of brackets and that extra taxes are only on a fraction of the income. So he was spending way more than what he would have paid in taxes. I had to tell him ""you should only spend if you can actually pay less taxes with that. You should not spend more just because taxes exist"". He said but the expenses are deductable. I said yeah that is the point. You can deduct it and then it goes off the highest brackets, and the tax is only a fraction within that bracket. You may not even fall in a lower bracket by deducting expenses.¬† | I was 22, my elder brother 24.  He asked me if my battery charger was available; I told him I no longer had it, as it had stopped working.

He immediately got angry, demanding what I had done to break it (he was always an asshole).

I told him patiently, and a little bemusedly, that I hadn't **done** anything to it - after years of use, it had stopped working of its own accord.

He got angrier again, insisting that ""*Things don't just break!  You had to have done something to it!*""

I had to explain to him that, yes, things can in fact just break.  They can over-heat, they can corrode, they can burn out, they can depreciate in all sorts of ways - devices don't last forever, and they **can** just break.  The pointless argument got heated and turned into a confrontation that was so futile and moronic that even my mother, who had his back 99% of the time, ended up taking my side and confirming that things can, indeed, just break over time.

I don't think he was happy about that.  Forget not knowing about the concept of entropy, my brother had reached 24 years of age and had not picked up on the idea that something could break other than by a human being accidentally (or intentionally) damaging it. | For a second story, I once had the privilege to work with a certified flat-earthed, conspiracy psycho. This was while I was in the military. We both had Top Secret clearances and this guy had flown in multiple planes and worked with satellites in his past. He should know better. I first thought he was screwing with me, but he had Alex Jones playing at his desk 24/7 and constantly on conspiracy sites. The ones selling CBD vitamins every other paragraph. Here's a short list of the things I've had to argue with this guy about:

‚Ä¢ World is flat. Proven because gyroscopes (like those in airplanes) break when turned upside down.

‚Ä¢ Flat Earth is surrounded by a giant ice wall that every nation in the world has a secret military stationed at to protect the secrets

‚Ä¢ Highschool rocket projects are in on the conspiracy

‚Ä¢ Vaccines kill 9/10 kids every year

‚Ä¢ Government is scrubbing the internet 24/7 to make sure the child deaths aren't reported 

‚Ä¢ Dinosaur fossils we're actually planted by rich people for reasons

‚Ä¢ Nephilim fossils, however, are real

‚Ä¢ Petrified forests are actually the fossilized remains of giants hair follicles

‚Ä¢ Aliens made the Grand canyon and hid priceless artifacts there

‚Ä¢ Chemtrails cause cancer, crime, and even ""The Gay""

I'm sure there's more I've forgotten, but I did my best to scrub him from my memory. | Somebody very close to me thinks all of evolution is a lie. Not even a strongly religious | That humans really did land on the moon, and that the Soviets would‚Äôve been happy as hell to expose any fakery about it. | They thought that the universe is 5000 years old and dinosaurs is a lie | In high school a classmate didn‚Äôt believe that Narwhals were real. Dude was dumbfounded when the teacher googles it for us and showed him pictures. | Why concentration camps were dehumanizing... yup, someone I know thought they were good... | The explanation of just cause your girlfriends dressing up doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs gonna fuck someone | I used to take a train downtown and then a bus to work. One day, the train was a few mins late and so I literally had to sprint to catch the bus or be late to work. I got hot from running and pulled out my water bottle from my bag and some guy started an argument with me about there being no food or drink on the bus... while holding a Starbucks coffee.

His argument was that he wasn't drinking it, so there was no chance for it to spill where as my water bottle could have spilled. I ignored him, but for 10 or 15 mins he wouldn't shut up and was really getting in my face (and I'd long put the water bottle away). So when I saw my stop coming and felt the bus slow down, I jumped up, ""accidentally"" knocked his coffee out of his hand and onto his lap and then shrugged and said ""oops, I guess it can spill"" and jumped off the bus. | Cheating on someone isn't just a mistake or an accident | Barcelona is no country. Even better we got to that argument cause HE liked the football club. 

And i also had to explain once that you wont get pregnant from just sleeping in one bed together. And i mean just sleeping, no sex. | That anxiety isnt something you have from being lazy. It was with my cousin and she said anxiety disorder comes from being lazy. When I asked her to elaborate she said that she keeps busy and she has never had anxiety. I honestly couldnt even keep arguing with stupid. | That a child should be able to say if they want to be hugged or notü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | I once had to explain to my (now ex) 35 year old boyfriend that tampons were in fact not pleasurable to insert. He thought because it went ""up there"" (direct quote) that a woman would feel some kind of pleasure from it. When i told him that was  not the case he was rather shocked and suggested i was incorrect and maybe ""it's just you that doesn't get anything from it"".  He also thought that UTI was the same as a STI. I, again, tried to explain that he was wrong but by then i couldn't help but laugh at the madness of this conversation. He did not take this well and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day (at this point, the silence was a blessing although rather awkward as we were stuck in a car together). 

On reflection, i regret some of my previous romantic choices if i'm perfectly honest. | Credit cards- I said you should utilize a max of 10% of your limit on credit cards and pay it off every month. 

They claim that is very, very wrong and in order to improve credit score you can charge the card up to your limit and pay the minimum every month. So the credit card company ‚Äúcan see you have money‚Äù to pay it off every month. 

This person is in their 40s. And credit is in shambles. 

The conversation ended with me telling them okay you‚Äôre right! | That adhd doesn‚Äôt in fact exist. That adult was my mentor teacher that said that it isn‚Äôt real in front of her whole class. Me‚Ä¶ a 17 year old had to respectfully take her out of the class for a second to tell her ‚Äúwhat are you doing? These are six year olds.‚Äù She responds with ‚Äúit‚Äôs only because their parents never say no. It‚Äôs not real.‚Äù ¬†Me: ‚Äùma‚Äôam I have Adhd, tell me to my face it‚Äôs because my parents didn‚Äôt know how to parent me.‚Äù She froze so I ended the conversation with ‚Äúat least my parents gave me knowledge.‚Äù She told my teacher she didn‚Äôt think I was fit to be one. | 1. White people can be Muslim.
2. Arab people can be Christian.
3. ‚ÄúBeing gay‚Äù wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúinvented‚Äù in the 70s. | No argument, really, but I found out my buddy of 40 years turned into a flat earther, and he is dead serious he believes it firmly.
All of us are sheep, the whole shenanigans with 5G, Covid and vaccines, you get the picture. 
He dropped recently at the end of a chat. The Earth is flat.
My answer was that I won't discuss it because the discussion would be futile.
Believe what you want, buddy.

He didn't annoy me with further shite, so there's that.
I won't tell him how ridiculous he is and he won't start to trying to convince me.
Awkward silence about the topic is better than arguing. | Cleaner for a large chain store. Was cleaning a feces mess in an aisle that I blocked off and multiple people continued barging through and tracking shit down several more aisles. Kept announcing this area was closed off but they wouldn't listen. One guy locked down at his shoes, looked back at me, made this stupid smirk and shrugged. Anyways next time y'all wonder who tf voted for laws that were just plain awful. | x (any number)*1=x

Their explanation of their side was literally addition (""If I have one water bottle and *add* another it's 2). | Water is a liquid | Not really an argument; but I once had a coworker tell me they didn't need to know that Mark Twain discovered the earth. | Convincing my former step father the horizon is real. | Every time I tell someone I used to live in Hong Kong. 

‚ÄúSo what was it like living in Japan?‚Äù

Like.. what? | Titanic happened. | When I worked in internet support I often had customers who thought they didn‚Äôt need to plug the power cord into their modem because they subscribed to wireless internet. | Had an employee show up two hours late for work and he loudly protested ""You can't expect people to be here at 5:30 in the *morning* every day!""

He was 33 years old. I told him that at 33, I shouldn't have to explain to him why an employer expects and employee to be on time for their assigned shift. | The influx of working age Asian men into San Francisco is, in fact, not a military invasion by the Chinese.

For some reason he couldn't believe that Chinese programmers and software engineers would immigrate en masses to partake in Silicon Valleys lucrative economy. It had to be an invasion. | Thats a kid who reaches 120 cm to the dot with shoes in a theme park wont reach out 120 cm height requirement barefoot in a pool slide. | Once had to explain to an ex what jury duty was‚Ä¶ he thought it was where ‚Äúadults go to talk about their feelings once a year‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ this man was 19 lol | I spent three hours arguing with my buddy, because he had said, ""Look at what I wrote on Facebook,"" and I had pointed out that ""a lot"" was two words. He refused to accept it, and no matter what I did for three hours, he wouldn't budge. He just couldn't admit to making a mistake. | Around the time the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X released, there was a dude who was a mutual of another guy (who was also an idiot; birds of the same flock, I guess) that told me with complete confidence ""Even PC gamers are jealous of the PlayStation 5, because its CPU has the ability to run at 100% utilization all the time"". I tried telling him that if your CPU is running at 100% usage for long periods at a time, it's because it wasn't designed to throttle or shut off before it inevitably damages itself, and his response was that he would know because he works at GameStop.


To this day, I can't imagine a scenario where I'd be looking in task manager, see my CPU is running at 100% consistently and not shit a brick. | Mine was arguing with someone over the meaning of second vs third place He felt that if the two people ahead of you tied for first, that meant you were second. Nothing would convince him otherwise.

It led to my very first migraine. | Arguing to my former friend that he wasn't the victim in his breakup. 

Let's call him Apple. 
Let's call his ex-girlfriend Raspberry.
Let's call Raspberry's 7 year old daughter Acorn.

Apple was my study buddy in university, and we both graduated with engineering degrees. He was always a party boy, a heavy drinker and drug abuser, and had a very high tolerance for substances. 

He met Raspberry at a party. She already had a newborn at that point. She was working hard to graduate from Computer Sciences at college. She graduated before the rest of us, and got a job right away. 

In the time we were ins school, Apple puked on Raspberry in bed, puked on her sheets, passed out so hard she couldn't move him, and publicly embarassing her multiple times.

Apple graduated in the pandemic and couldn't find a job for over a year. Raspberry supported him throughout all of that in her small 2-bedroom basement apartment.

After getting a job, Apple worked at an construction firm for 5 months. The pay wasn't great. I got Apple an interview at the company I work for. Good pay. He and Raspberry moved into a bungalow. Apple worked at my company for 4 months and got fired for watching movies from sketchy websites on his work computer. He was unemployed again. 

Raspberry supported Apple for another 2 years. 

Apple refused to get a job that didn't pay atleast 6 figures. 

Apple got stone-cold blackout drunk minimum once a week. Drugs were almost always involved. 

Apple didn't contribute to rent (but somehow he had money for alcohol/ drugs) 

Apple made other people's friends uncomfortable. He made ME uncomfortable. I'm a girl. He made sexual advances towards me, showing me I wasn't one of the boys, I was just a sex object. 

He crashed raspberry's car.

He ripped acorn out of her bed one night in a drunken haze and pissed either on her or around her (I don't know the full details). 

There is MUCH MUCH MORE

BUT after 6 years of hell, Raspberry broke up with him. 

Apple believes he is the victim, and that he's a wounded animal who needs support, needs HIS friends to break of contact with HER (spoiler: we all chose Raspberry), and he is adamant that she cheated on him with her now-boyfriend (who we all LOVE TO DEATH, and NO she didn't cheat).

Long story short, delusional people need professional help. | No, the Moon doesn‚Äôt only come out at night. | Awhile ago my dad was trying to feed my little dog a grape and I was like ‚ÄúNO! It‚Äôs poisonous for dogs‚Äù and he didn‚Äôt believe me and wanted me to feed him grapes üòî | I used to work security, at the gate we had a very simple rule; no outside food or beverages except for SEALED plastic water bottles. You could bring in empty bottles to refill inside of the park, but anything other than a brand new water bottle was forbidden. Problem was, people would sell drinks out of coolers like 50ft from the entrance, so people would buy sodas and stuff, then be forced to dump them. The number of times I had to get into a shouting match with a grown adult about not being able to bring their sugar water, was insane. Watching them act all defiant and chugging their drinks like they were proving a point to me was the most fun. I don't care what you do with it, as long as it doesn't come in the park. 

The other funny thing was watching grown adults dump their water into a trashcan instead of the grass or one of the many trees around. Once you tell them they have to dump it, it ceases to be water for some reason and registers as trash. | I waitressed at a pretty high-end sushi restaurant. A lady ordered her sushi and proceeded to act shocked when she received it and her shrimp was cooking. She called me over, asked what was going on because she ordered shrimp *sushi* and in her words ""sushi means *RAW""*. So I tell her (in much more professional terms) 'lady, you're wack. you can't have raw shrimp.' 

She proceeds to make a scene and demand my manager (the owner) come over, to which my owner laughs and goes ""Raw shrimp gives you worms"" before turning around and leaving it at that.

Edit: I‚Äôm learning now that you CAN have raw shrimp but it‚Äôs one of those ‚Äúvery specifically picked‚Äù type deals. | That Dinosaurs weren't ""just"" a few thousand years ago | We had backyard chickens and did not have a rooster. My coworker asked how did they lay eggs if there was no rooster. I said they lay eggs, they just won‚Äôt get fertilized or ever hatch as a chicken. He refused to believe it and kept insisting you need a rooster.

I finally said, ‚ÄúLook, you know my partner is a woman right? Yet she and I both get a period every month because our bodies send out an egg cell even though there are no guys around. Hen‚Äôs bodies do the same thing.‚Äù

Then he got distracted and grossed out by the idea of eggs being ‚Äúhen‚Äôs periods‚Äù. 

Schools seriously fail at teaching basic biology. | That a ‚ÄúWrap‚Äù (food, not the word) is not a Shawarma. | I am assuming this was an adult, but on Reddit, someone said a coin flip isn‚Äôt 50/50, because they flipped it 10 times and it was heads 7 times.  Ergo, coin flips can never be 50/50. | That my wife who slept in my house every day after saying she wanted out of the relationship (by sending a text message) and got pregnant 38 days later (still in my house) that she didn‚Äôt cheat.

Im pretty good if i say myself and im shooting with my dad in a 5 man squad (thats the max number excluding the REF) Were using his double barrel shotgun which is absolutely beautiful and i have it open, unloaded and over my shoulder how all kids are taught (or should be). Our fucking ref walks over like a marine DI and says ""Hey dont put your gun over your shoulder. I respond with ""well im sorry but this is how i was taught and i dont wanna put it on my foot."" he responds with ""well your gonna have to because a kid hit me in the nose with his stock sme time back and i had to have surgery on it."" At this point my dad heard the commotion and basically told him "" hey listen here fucker, my kid knows what he is doing. He has won national champion and has gotten cash for what he has done. Now back the fuck off or you'll deal with me."" I was personally shocked and everyone else was to and after that round of skeet another ref came on after he was told what happened. | I had to tell a 30 year old woman that it is the man that determines the gender of his children.¬† | That water evaporating is not a chemical change. | The best way to tear off a paper towel from the paper towel roll with my mother. (Just recently, believe it or not.) | When I worked on a cruise ship, I had to:

2) elevators don‚Äôt go to the front of the ship, they only go up and down. | That you can‚Äôt get pregnant from a bj | When I was a kid, I got into an argument with a teacher about being able to see the moon during the day.

They were insisting that the moon could only be seen at night.

Conversation went something like this:
Me: ""So the 6oz is $8 and the 9oz is $11"".
Her: ""Ok, but how big are they""? I had to pause for a second.
Me: ""Well you can do 6oz or 9oz, small or large""
Her: ""Yeah but the 9oz, like, how big is it""? Never had to bite my tongue so hard. Took a deep breath, and said;
Me: ""It comes to about here on the glass"".
Her: ""Hmm, I'll just do a Mich Ultra"". For whatever its worth, this girl was 33 | A ""potential"" client on a platform i work with had hired me for something at 12pm. In the description, it said that they didnt need me at 12 but needed me at 10pm instead... The client then explained that when they tried to hire me for the time but it was greyed out.

I had to punch myself in the face a few times, but i eventually told her its greyed out because i'm busy for that time slot, and it was not choosable/grey for a reason. I tried to reason and reschedule, but the client was adamant on that time, and unfortunately chose to cancel.

Icing on the cake? The platform i work with started banning people for cancellations lol. | That thunder is *not* created by two clouds bumping into each other. | I once had to explain to a grown man with kids that the absorbency level of a tampon has nothing to do with how big a woman‚Äôs vagina is.

This man was married. | A disagreement with a 20 year old man over how to properly shower. | My ex was convinced the book Animal Farm was about promoting veganism and nothing to do with communism. | I was in the military several years ago. I lived in a small quarters while deployed (you fellow servicemen/women know what I‚Äôm talking about) so some of you may understand how tightly people can be under those circumstances. One particular guy, and mind you everyone in there was at least 20, 21 years of age, couldn‚Äôt comprehend why it was important to shower. He stunk like no human that had the means of bathing should, and we had to put up with it until some of the upper rank guys finally had enough. It took our superiors forcing him into the shower and him visually showing them he was actually showering (imagine how that looks). It was the most asinine thing witnessing a grown man act like that. | My sister once told me my eating disorder was all in my head.

I'm dyslexic and I was talking to another fellow with it. Can't remember what the convo was, but I got something mixed up or confused as a result of the dyslexia. I just went ""ops my bad, thats the dyslexia for you""

This guy then just went on a 10 minute rant of ""THATS NOT AN EXCUSE I HAVE IT TO"". He spent the entire time ranting its not any form of learning disability and shouldn't be used as an excuse, over and over

I was dumb founded, I didn't give an excuse, I gave a reason. And that reason is its literally considered a learning disability. | Had an argument with my college roommate about dinosaurs. He didn‚Äôt believe dinosaurs actually existed and said ‚Äúscientists can put bones together in any way to make whatever they want.‚Äù My counter to that was ‚Äúbut where did they find these giant F‚Äôing bones???‚Äù

This happened around 2018 or 2019. The person who usually works in the fitting room told me they were gonna go on their 15 min break so I‚Äôm watching the register and fitting room at the same time. An old lady and her husband came in, she asked for dress pants. Led her to them and said she was good from there after telling her where the fitting room was. I‚Äôm going back and forth ringing up customers and cleaning the fitting rooms. The old lady comes out from the fitting room and asks if dress pants are supposed to be like this or that then mentioned she only ever wears petite. She didn‚Äôt tell me she only wore petite sizes at all when she came in and asked for my help. I answered her questions about the pants and told her if she was specifically looking for petite then it would be a little bit more down the aisle from where I led her before. I also mentioned I couldn‚Äôt take her to the section myself as I can‚Äôt be too far from the register or fitting room. 

From there, she started catching an attitude with me with people watching and waiting to use the fitting rooms. She goes back to change out of her regular clothes and I go back to ringing up customers. She comes up to purchase the pants she tried on, saw that they weren‚Äôt on sale, asked me why, I go check the rack with the dress pants, explained the situation on how it‚Äôs not part of the sale that‚Äôs listed on the sign, she gets mad at me because the pants aren‚Äôt on sale. Her and her husband start to say mean stuff towards me while the people in line were watching. She doesn‚Äôt even buy the pants and demands to exit through the store from a different door that‚Äôs already locked up and secured for the night. I told her the only door that is open is through the men‚Äôs section. Disliked my answer, talked smack again and demanded I get a manager to open the door for them. I called a manager, explained the situation and they opened the door for them. 

Another one I can think of is when this family tried to purchase a few pairs of Levi pants that were on sale. They handed me a coupon and I told them that coupons don‚Äôt apply to named brands such as Levi‚Äôs, Adidas, Nike, etc. The wife got upset and said that she was told coupons can work on Levi pants. I read the small fine print of the bottom, read it aloud and showed her saying, any named brands such as Levi, etc. are excluded from coupons. She got even more upset and just shoved the pants over the register. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | Him: There are like 8 billion people in America

Him: No. haha there are trillions of people in the world. 

He‚Äôs my ex. I defended her and even showed him on Google. He still argued his point. And shortly after this he was very angry that I said she‚Äôs smarter than he is. Over the years he would do this type of thing often. He believed that if he made it up in his head it‚Äôs true. He made up all kinds of statistics all the time. 

After we broke up we continued to text every so often. He told me was rich. He found gold at the lake his parents live by. He sent a picture. Of rocks. He sent me a picture of rocks. This began a whole new argument to which he said he bought a gold tester and knows for a fact it‚Äôs gold. 

This led to him telling me that at that same lake, there are remains of giant angels from biblical times buried under the lake. That‚Äôs why God built the lake. 

The lake is man made and was completed in 1973. 

But that didn‚Äôt matter because God told him otherwise. He decoded it in the Bible. And he‚Äôs the only one able to do so. 

Yes. The man has obvious psychosis and it worsened over the time I knew him. Very much drug and alcohol induced. But he‚Äôs also the biggest dick I‚Äôve ever known so I have no issue telling him how stupid he is.

Edit he may not have psychosis. He really just comes off as a chronic liar that wants to look smart and superior. I think he wants to be a cult leader. Honestly he said and did things that suggest that. 

But it‚Äôs likely he‚Äôs delusional and believes his own lies not because of psychosis but because he thinks that highly of himself. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm free from him. | It‚Äôs not your wife‚Äôs fault that the sleep schedule biohacking thing you got from a podcast isn‚Äôt working, there is no way to survive on just 30 minute naps.

That the animals didn't get to go on the ark and were only a few hundred years old. They didn't think radiocarbon dating (or argon or Uranium/Lead for old old stuff) was real because the earth couldn't have been 12-ish million years old like the site was dated to be. 

Also that the reason why people in the Bible like Noah lived to be like 600 years old was because there was so many clouds covering the earth before the flood that there was no UV radiation that would age you. Now that the clouds are gone and the sun can reach the earth, we age. 

It was wild. I'm a biology grad student with a degree in geology and I just had to stand there and go ""uh well actually""

I once had a customer get very mad at me for saying I did not like Five Peanut Meth Crunch's music. Because its just generic as fuck butt-metal if you can even call it metal.

He said, and I quote ""BUT FIVE FINGER DEATH PUNCH WROTE BAD COMPANY FOR THE MILI-TREE"" (military)

I spent far too long having to explain to him that FFDP did not write Bad Company, it was a cover originally written by the band of the same name. Also, that it was not in fact written with any pro-military intentions behind it.

....he was having none of it. Even downright refused to look at the phone when I googled the shit for him.

Some people cannot even be dragged unwillingly to the truth; they will only ever believe what they choose to believe. | I'm not sure if they're adults since this is the internet but it's surprising how often people want to argue that Star Wars isn't intended for kids. | Too many versions in the business world. Im talking basic business principles; budgeting, supply/demand. It‚Äôs like everyone slept through class AND forgot the could google best practices. | There was a guy who was hired on where I work. We'll call him...""Dave."" Mid 40s, said he had a background as a machinist which is why he was brought on board.

I operate 3 different machines in the steel shop, all of them CNC surface grinders which perform various operations on specific tools and it was my duty to train him eventually on all 3 machines over the course of about a year.

Dave would go on and on about how he's never done work like this before. Lots of math involved, setting up programs for very precise material removal using different grinding wheels and carbide inserts. I tell him something like ""well it's all part of the job, we'll get you there.""

He then says ""Yeah but I'm used to being a machinist. You guys aren't machinists here, you're grinders.""

""I mean, these are grinding machines, Dave.""

""Well, I'm a machinist, and this isn't what machinists do!""

Dave didn't last long. | I'm a cashier. Many times I've had to argue with adults about how to use the DIVIDER STICK.

This person refused to believe me. In their mind dolphin fish (mahi-mahi) are the true dolphins, but people mistakenly refer to long nosed porpoises as dolphins. And porpoises are a small member of the whale family. Because orcas are large porpoises, but also called killer whales, so porpoises=whales.  And cetaceans are fish because they don't have hair or nipples like mammals should. (Yes they fucking do) | Had to teach a guy how to read a tape measure. Homeboy couldn‚Äôt grasp that (1/2) = (2/4) = (4/8) = (8/16) and would insist they were different numbers.

I asked him why so many and he proudly stated he had figured out that he can snack on them without it spiking his sugars because its 'sugar free'. As I was explaining that no, fruits do in fact contain sugars in the form of fructose, his cousin who also works with us reiterated that fruit is sugar free. These men are in their 50s. I had to explain it again and got them to look it up. Colleague then got mad at me for 'ruining his hack.' He still eats apples constantly anyway. | That, no, not all women who wear glasses are lesbian. This was immediately after showing this grown adult woman my new glasses.

She opened my gift and it was some noise making baby toy that she was happy to receive. Her boss looks at me and goes ""how did you know where to find that?"" And I was like I just went to the baby section of Walmart. ""Yeah but how did you know?"" And she keeps pushing, and it just feels dumb, and extra. So I go there are signs, you follow those signs in the store and they tell you where items are. But she pushes more because idk, I have some secret baby or store knowledge that she doesn't. Luckily my friend's husband stepped in, but to this day I have no idea what the point was. | That jerking off in a group shower probably won't have the desired outcome if you're among other summer camp staffers.

We were looking at the baby chicks at the Texas rodeo. I kept arguing that no.

No, seriously. It started because she didn't believe in evolution. She gave the ""it's just a theory"" argument. I pointed out that so is gravity. She then argued I can't prove gravity exists. I jumped then walked away. | If I have one more uneducated douche that says my state is in Mexico (New Mexico) I‚Äôm gonna explode. | That animal crackers aren't pet treats | My cousin doesn't believe in the moon landing because we aren't going there all the time now. I told him I didn't believe in the pyramids because we don't build them now (i do believe in the pyramids, i only said this to prove a point). He was SHOCKED that I didn't believe in the pyramids! How could I not believe in something that's so well documented? He almost got the point but you can never connect the dots with someone whose pen is out of ink. | This lady asked how old I was, and when I told her, she told me she thought I was a couple of years older because I am tall.

I was 21 and explained to her that the logic didn't make sense because I am an adult, but she was certain my height made me look older. | I...am like 99% joking about this.

Coworker argued with me that our sun does not orbit the galaxy. It just sits still, apparently. He believes the moon orbits earth and earth orbits the sun. But no, our sun is stationary. Cool. I gently touched on universal expansion - everything is in motion - and I could see his eyes glazing over. Gave that up. Told him to Google it. He refused to Google it saying he didn‚Äôt need to check. I told him it‚Äôs okay to learn new things. It‚Äôs okay to not already know everything. And told him I was disappointed in him. XD

He later approached and claimed he was just messing with me. Obviously he finally googled and felt stupid. | Had to explain to my apartment building manager that they get ~20% discount on their rent if their rent is subtracted from their pre tax salary | Someone told me foreskins should be cut because of organized religious ordeals, Some junk with Abraham mandating so. And all I could ask was
If God really didn't want us having foreskins, then why did he literally make us with them? | In the 3rd grade, I pointed out that a poster of the planets was inaccurate because Jupiter actually has a faint system of rings around it which were not pictured.  A fellow student vehemently disagreed with me, to the point of escalating it to our teacher.  She just sided with him based on the poster!  I was and am, to this day, livid and I argued it with her until she shut the argument down and said that's that.  I will never drop this grudge. (/s) | Yes, many times everyday. I work in a pharmacy, and everyday, several times per day, people want to argue various things in regards to their medications. Often times, it‚Äôs the same conversation every week for about 80% of the patients. | At 21 years old, I had to explain to a 33 year old coworker what a foreskin was. 

I'm sure he still doesn't understand it. | That eggs are not dairy.  They tried to argue HARD that I shouldn‚Äôt be eating eggs because I am lactose intolerant.  Apparently anything that comes from a farm is dairy. | That eggs are not in fact dairy. Still blows my mind the number of grown adults who honestly think eggs are dairy | That hot water comes to a boil faster than cold water. 

The first year that my fianc√© met my extended family was at a Christmas dinner. My mom‚Äôs sister was prepping the ingredients and so my fianc√© offered to help by filling a pot with hot water. My aunt immediately corrects her and informs my fianc√©, who holds a Bachelors in chemistry, that cold water will come to a boil faster than hot water. My fianc√© laughed believing that she was joking around with her but my aunt was dead serious and then became offended when my partner tried explaining why that is not true. | That sweat cools you down... They thought sweat made you lose weight and got rid of ""toxins"" whatever that means.... Like its literally humans biggest evolutionary advantage and they had absolutely no idea. And most other adults around didn't know either. I work with idiots | Asked a friend to send me a homework assignment via fax, because I was sick and didn‚Äòt receive the worksheet. He didn‚Äòt want to, because he thought his physical sheet of paper would be transferred to me and he‚Äòd lose his homework. That was at an age quite close to graduating school. | No so much an argument but my wife refuses to believe the pause on her toothbrush is indicating 30 seconds have passed, She thinks it's because she is brushing too hard, Every 30 seconds :P | That Michael Jackson was black. My sister didn't believe me when I told her and it got into a pretty heated argument lol | Why putting on a mask in public was required | Masturbating 8 times in a day was impossible | There is no upside down in outer space | Explaining sexual abuse to my which I went through to my own dad because he dismissed me when i told him about it. 

Once, on a family trip (just me as a girl, and dad brother and 2 uncles and this one other guy who was a friend of my uncle), we got down at a restaurant and this guy started rubbing his leg on me. 

I couldn‚Äôt believe what was happening so I immediately left once the shock wore off and waited at the restroom so I could tell my dad about it. i told him, expecting he‚Äôll do something about it but to my disappointment, he just said, lets leave it here we‚Äôre not gonna see him later anyways. On the way back, he was chatting with him while I was literally crying, hiding my face in my bag so no one would know.

 years later, I mustered the courage to talk to him about it and how it‚Äôs still haunting me that he betrayed my trust. Hes like ‚Äòno i told that uncle about that friend. Again, we didn‚Äôt see him again so thats done‚Äô.

I can‚Äôt believe he literally just dismissed sexual abuse??? I can‚Äôt believe I explained sexual abuse to a father and he just dismissed it with the same triviality of fake scolding a kid for taking another kids lollipop. Like whatt?? The same guy who created me? I was dumbfounded. | I got into an argument with my cousins friend about immigration. Both of his parents are from Mexico and immigrated here legally. But he was 100% against immigration. He wanted a wall, wanted all immigrants rounded up and tossed in jail or shipped out. He literally wouldn't be in this country if his parents hadn't decided to come here. 

We almost came to blows when I told him I was better Christian than he is and I'm an atheist. Some people are just not worth your time. | This older Canadian lady kept saying that my Texan accent was fake because apparently young people didn't speak like that anymore. She kept saying that I was acting because my mom didn't have an accent when she spoke. I spent like 10 minutes trying to be polite and convince her that this was my real accent, but she didn't believe me. At the end we just walked away, but I still get pissed thinking about. Like my bad for being raised in a small town | I had an argument with my husband that got pretty heated, he insisted that acetaminophen and ibuprofen were the exact same thing, and he swore he had seen it labeled at drug stores like ibuprofen aka acetaminophen. He got legit mad at me when I told him that they were two different, albeit similar things. | My husband and I getting a second dog caused extreme distress in my Boomer mother in law because she couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúhandle one more thing.‚Äù We live 3 hours away‚Ä¶.. | I once referenced light going 186,000 miles a second and they said I was wrong and that it traveled at  300,000 kilometers per second. | I was loosening a screw with flathead, a Phillips would have been better but that‚Äôs all I had and it was working. I was unscrewing because another part I was trying get to was broken. A manager comes in, not my manager but higher up than me comes in and tells me if I had the correct screwdriver in the correct size, everything would work. I tried to tell him that is irrelevant to the issue of the whole item not working because I already solved the screw part. He couldn‚Äôt grasp the screw isn‚Äôt the issue and there are multiple ways to solve that small part of the problem. | Ive worked retail.  People are stupid. | The first one that came to mind instantly, was arguing over if the earth was flat or not.

If anyone was wondering, I was (and still am) *Team Round Earth*. | North doesn't mean in front of you. It's a set direction. | If something isn‚Äôt yours, don‚Äôt take it. | $2 bills are real. | Had to convince a brother-in-law that the moon landing was real. Hard to believe that was only the first red flag. | That there was genocide in Australia. | Why a moron needed to not smoke while FUELING his vehicle | That a goose and ""a geese"" were not two different bird species. | Basically arguing against anyone about Trump. You wonder how these fucking people have lived so long | I stepped into once with an older couple ( older than me, I‚Äôm 72) who pointed at the ‚Äúchem trails‚Äù that high flying jets were leaving ‚Äúto poison us‚Äù. | That donating $3 daily to the 2024 Trump campaign was a higher priority than providing his wife with money for 1 book. She loves hard copies and has a hard time seeing digital books. He told her she can only use Libby and she can no longer buy books. They are both retired and had careers, but he controls the money. His wife's only hobby is reading and her mind is failing. She might not have much longer to enjoy reading.

Also, the same guy argued that you should not eat fruit because sugar is the root of all health problems. His wife's favorite foods are fruits. He says she is no longer allowed to eat fruits. Witnessed him shame her for wanting 1 piece of pineapple after having a slider sandwich and a handful of grapes. She has lost so much weight since being forced on the carnivore diet that he claims cured his diabetes. She was never overweight and had no health problems related to nutrition. She now weighs so little, that a strong breeze could push her over. She does have a failing heart, which her doctors said could get worse due to her losing so much weight. 

He also says immigrants are the root of all problems in the US. He wants all borders to be closed and anyone not born on US soil to be deported. His wife is Canadian and he has to periodically renew her visa. The irony is lost on him. | I was in 10th grade and had to argue with my teacher (and another student) explaining why I blew up his house in Minecraft. It was my server and all the boys were on it, this one kid had been annoying so we blew his house up as a joke. He took it personal and complained to the teachers, so I had to have a full proper meeting explaining why I blew it up and had to apologise. I actually got in trouble and had to argue why that's ridiculous, eventually got myself off with a warning. | I (a teen in their first part time job at the time) was trying to tell a customer (grown adult who had to be in their 40s at least) that a dime is 10 cents and a nickel is 5 cents, they thought it was the reverse. The conversation lasted long enough where I can confirm they spoke English fluently and were not special needs. I remember my manager had to take over and then we got really busy so I don‚Äôt know if that customer is still roaming around still thinking that. | To try and make a factual point that the holocaust actually happened and that Hitler was an evil sadistic piece of doo doo. | That I'm not lying about being unable to tolerate certain foods and that I don't avoid eating certain food just to piss people off. You'd be surprised how many people get angry and combative when you have digestive problems that make it difficult for you to eat a varied diet. | Someone I know thinks the whole going to the moon thing was a hoax. Thinks global warming is a lie. I couldn‚Äôt even argue because of the sheer stupidity of it. üò≠ | I had someone in /r/cmv tell me that obeying traffic laws was unfair because it was too difficult for poor people. That was the point I stopped responding. | That I couldn't put down the window in the plane so she could throw her trash out.....i had to explain this to a woman on a plane, admittedly her first flight, but still. | I was very certain in an argument last year that Jackalopes were/are real animals. | My coworker, with a master‚Äôs degree in biology, explained to me that cigars were healthy because they are made only from tobacco and therefore did not have nicotine in them. They considered cigarettes to be bad due to the ‚Äúadded‚Äù nicotine and paper. They got a bit heated so I ended up just walking away from that one. | That ""quarter till 6"" and 5:35 are not the same time. I gave up, by the way. Explained it as if he were a kindergartner and no soap. | That no, there weren't 100 minutes in an hour. This was with a person whose sole job it was to add up times for people. | That no I don't have to come in to work early or stay back late unpaid if I don't have to and don't want to. Getting the nickname 5 0 because you left work at 5pm and no later (as contracted) is wild | You can‚Äôt give someone pink eye by looking at them | Not me, but I had a friend in college who had to explain to his roommate that air conditioning was not provided by the city like water. | That rubber trees are a real thing that we harvest rubber from. | That ‚ÄúDemure‚Äù is a real word that has existed forever and not ‚ÄúStupid Gen Z slang‚Äù. | That if several people commit a crime they don't split the punishment. | Me (in London) on the phone to a customer in Texas, trying to explain it was a different time of day for me.

> What? Are you trying to tell me it's a different time for you over there?

>Well you see sir, the earth rotates on an imaginary axis
... | That the days getting shorter in the fall and longer in the spring wasn't variable. It didn't happen earlier this year than last year. | That West Virginia IS NOT PART OF VIRGINIA! Countless times I‚Äôve had to explain this. No West Virginia is not western Virginia either. It‚Äôs a completely different state beside Virginia. I can‚Äôt believe grown adults don‚Äôt know the states of the country they live in.  Yes I‚Äôm originally from West Virginia | Had to argue with my Dad‚Äôs GF that German Shepherds don‚Äôt speak German. | I can't believe there's full grown adults with working brains that still believe abortion should be outlawed. | With my wife. What she wants for dinner. Every. Damn. Night. | That the earth üåé wasn't flat. | Can‚Äôt believe I have to argue that a racist, rapist, pedo, grifting con man felon who tried to have his vp killed during his attempt to overthrow the free & fair election (which he finally admitted he lost) should not be anywhere near the office of president | Donald Trump was not a good president and statistics prove this. | Explaining to people that retail pharmacies don‚Äôt choose the prices of their medication but their insurance does. 

The amount of times I had a patient say they were going to another pharmacy expecting a cheaper rate was insane. | If you are an able bodied adult, you need to know how to swim, no excuses. | Most of them, honestly. üòê | Lift the toilet seat when you pee. 

Flush when you shit. 

Not entirely sure he wipes his ass. | Just yesterday I hit in a tiff on here with a person that posted an article about Italian food and used the article to bolster their argument even though the article‚Äôs entire intent was to debunk their point. | Had an adult over 40 years old not fully understanding math. This was when the powerball was 1.5 billion and this adult believed that was enough to give all Americans 1 million dollars each. As in 1 million dollars per person of a 300 million population.
I tried so hard to scale it up from 1 person to 10 to 100 people and this adult couldn't comprehend it. | While working on some renovations with my father-in-law, he asked me to lay out all the rough plumbing. When done, I showed him how the vent pipe would be 1/4"" outside of the wall, but not to worry, we could just shift the wall 1/4"" and it would fit perfect. An hour long drunken argument ensued about why it was all wrong and we needed to cut floor joists and buy more fittings and repipe the whole bathroom. I finally had enough and walked away. | My mother doesn't believe being gay or straight is a choice. She does, however, believe that being Bisexual is somehow a choice, because she doesn't understand how someone could be attracted to both men and women. She then goes on to say that once a bisexual person decides to be in a relationship (especially marriage) with a particular sex, they have made their choice to be either homosexual or straight and are no longer attracted to the other option.

Sex ed really isn't something children should have to teach their parents. | That time-wise, a ‚Äúquarter after‚Äù or a ‚Äúquarter till‚Äù does not mean 25 minutes. I gave up after half an hour. The woman was in her forties. | In a parking garage waiting to leave an event over the weekend. All cars at a standstill for 15-20 minutes. Truck in the parking spot perpendicular to my car starts backing up so I give a polite
""Hey I'm right behind you don't back into me"" honk. They stop. Then a minute or two later, they start creeping again despite nobody moving during that time. Honk again a little more incessantly. Then they start moving again a minute later. I get out (since nobody has moved in forever and clearly nobody is going anywhere anytime soon) and shout at them to stop backing into my car. The guy tries yelling back he's not going to but I can clearly see his truck doesn't have anywhere near the turning radius to avoid me. I kept yelling to stop and he eventually did. I pulled as close to the car in front of me as possible and was very thankful that 2 other cars pulled out in front of him so I wouldn't be the victim of idiot road rage or just total driving incompetence. I would have been so pissed if I had been run into while sitting still for 25+ minutes with nowhere to go. | Yes you have to be to work on time | After college I got this part time, entry level, minimum wage assistant job in my field.  Ok just got to pay my dues and things will go my way eventually.  It was my job to double check the work of the lady above me.  She hated the idea that someone might catch her mistakes.  The last argument we had was on a legal document which needed to be perfect the first time, and me trying to explain that Washington D.C. is not the state of Washington.  They are two different places.  So then the manager came in and helped resolve the conflict...and she resented the hell out of that...and me leaving the whole effin industry is the long story short. | I tried explaining that England is not in fact still run by a monarchy, and that the royal family were at best simply statesmen and stateswomen. She didn‚Äôt understand. | Had a coworker profess his distrusts of banks to me. He said he keeps all his money in his mattress because and I quote ‚Äúwhen the American economy tanks and the banks go under I don‚Äôt wanna lose all my money.‚Äù  We spent like 2 hours trying to convince him the cash he had wouldn‚Äôt be worth the paper it was printed on if the American economy tanked.

This kid also threw a temper tantrum when his dad sold his home and didn‚Äôt give him a share of the profit because it was his home too‚Ä¶ | I had too tell a woman not to teach her bare hands into the salad bar where I work because I‚Äôll have to throw away the trays contents due to contamination. She looked at me like I had two heads. | This is probably fairly mild compared to some written here, but I remember telling my old boss that she couldn't speak to employees the way she did. She had reduced a Chinese friend of mine to tears calling her a ""stupid Asian"" and literally just digging at her all the time. I mean, she was horrible to everybody, but really had it in for this poor woman. I thought the world of her and had my first full blown argument about how unreasonable and cruel my boss was. It was a family company, so she thought they were outside the law as far as employees went but I told her that there would be plenty of things to report. I thought I would be sacked for how I shouted at her, but I wasn't. Left soon after...along with my friend. Cow bag. | Telling someone to not play with a small animal after nearly harming it, I'm 17 and the one who I argued with was my dad in his 40s. He was drunk at the time, but even a drunk idiot would know not to continue playing with a tiny animal after dropping it or claim it was ""a harmless joke"". | Not an adult technacly but someone who should know way better who was my age.

I had to explain to this dumbass that HITLER was not a ""Modern Day Moses"" cause this idiot did his modern day moses presentation in relegion class, on Hitler. Its been a year since that and im 90% sure he still belives that. Keep in mind, this idiot was on his WW2 unit in history. | I got in an argument with a coworker about how there's an area near Baltimore called Timmonium, he refused to believe that was a real place but was fine with an area called Goochland in va where we were living/working. I literally pulled up google maps to show that timmonium was an actual place and he didn't believe it. | I once got into an argument with another attorney because he insisted that the word ""brown"" had two syllables. He was in his 50s. | Why how things are being said matters more than what is actually being said | Arguing with several friends and family members that Kraft singles aren't real cheese. They legally can't call it cheese. | Last week.

""sleeping giant"" mountain in Hawaii is NOT a freaking fossilized giant.fuck outta here, Jason. | War crimes are bad and that's apparently not something everybody believes, which is kinda... idk, soul crushingly sad? | I had an adult argue with the that the potato based pasta, gnocchi, was actually pronounced ‚Äúganache‚Äù.  Like no lady.  We went back and forth twice and then I just gave up.   No point arguing with morons.    I was 18.  This woman was over 40 and adamant that I was some idiot kid. | i work front desk for an oral surgeon, i took a man‚Äôs payment for his procedure and said ‚Äúi‚Äôll have you sign one copy of the receipt, the other will be yours to keep‚Äù. he huffed at me and said that *i* should be the one signing the receipt because i took the payment. i had to explain to him that because it‚Äôs *his* payment on *his* credit card for *his* treatment that we require *his* signature. we went round a couple times with me repeating myself very clearly and finally said, ‚Äúwell sir, i‚Äôm sorry you disagree but either way i need your signature on that receipt‚Äù and he finally signed it and sat down | Playing footsie with another stranger is unacceptable. Goodbye forever you damaged bitch. | I once had to explain to a person that there's no such thing as grass fed chicken, because chickens will eat anything and everything except grass. He wasn't having it, even after I told him that I've raised chickens before and they will literally peck and eat each other if you're not careful. | Listened to a shop keeper explain that the 90 pipe meant it was at 90 degrees while making the angle with his hands. And that the 45 meant that the pipe was 45 degrees. The customer didn't understand. This was ina head shop BTW. | During a week long power outage my family kept asking me why we had no Internet, it went something like this 

Why don't we have Internet 

Because there no power 

But we have a generator, just plug it in 

The city has no power even if I plug it in it won't work 

But we have Wi-Fi | When I was 19 I had to explain to my 25 year old ex con coworker that just because she was on top when you finished doesn‚Äôt mean she can‚Äôt get pregnant. | I bought a laptop charger at the Computer section of a Big departament store, and I asked for a 65 W one. But the salesman insisted that I would burn my laptop because the charger was too powerful and would PUSH too much electricity into the battery.

Yes, Sir. That is exactly how charging works. Don't worry...


Another one: asking the ""photo specialist"" of an electronics store about the image noise of a camera with a quite small sensor he said very seriously: ""Sir, this is not like the old cameras. This is digital and is completely silent.""

Ohhhh. Thank you! | I have had to argue with a middle aged woman for 10 minutes when I worked at Starbucks, explaining to her why her blonde roast was not blonde, and why it‚Äôs called blonde roast. She would not listen to me, she literally could not comprehend why her coffee wasn‚Äôt BLONDE in color. I‚Äôm pretty sure my brain fried that day and I shut down after that conversation. | That no, Scottish cows do not say McMoo, my mum way joking. | Working at a grocery store and doing my usual shift a woman comes up to me (I was one of those people who shopped for other peoples orders from 4am-1pm at said grocery store). A woman in her 50s comes up to me in the Asian food aisles and is already mad at me because I stepped out of her way with my giant cart.

""Where is the grape jelly you add into that Asian sauce?"" She asked me. I asked her to be more specific. She pulls out a jar of concord grape jelly from her cart while rolling her eyes at me.

""I need grape jelly that is not this grape jelly and it's always dowe here to make that oriental sauce I make. You guys don't even have the sauce or jelly I need. Why did they even hire you if you don't know basic recipes like this."" She scoffed and rolled along with her cart. I was confused, and annoyed by her casual racism but just went about my day. 

What in the white people shit üòÇ | Was at the drag strip with my kid and his jr. dragster. ALL of the pit spots are at 45 degree angle to the pit lanes. A hundred plus racers all figured out how to pit on the correct angle... except the idiots next to me. They parked at 45 degrees... the opposite way. 90 degrees to \*everyone\* else.  They took up two complete pit spots, \*plus\* blocked us from using the entrance of ours.

I politely asked if they were maybe just unloading and were going to move soon so we could use our pit. Older guy from their parts starts yelling at me that we don't own the track and they're pitted fine. I asked if he knew about the angle parking and he said ""yes, idiot, I am angle parked.""

I asked him ""which is it? Are you blind or just f\*cking stupid? Nobody is that stupid. You must be blind. Holy shit, how do you drive?"" He started to beak off but somebody from their pit clued in to just how wrong they were and pulled the old guy away.

Later, they moved their stuff \*just enough\* to not be in our way, but at the same time, make their pit almost unusable. | 1) I couldn't be ""tempting teachers into thinking inappropriate thoughts"" about me by wearing shorts to school because was a child. 

2) that they couldn't arrest me for truancy because I had already graduated. 

3) anything about pronouns nowadays. Yall dumb af. | That the bullet shot out of a gun drops at the same speed as anything else that is falling. Like you obviously day dreamed all of your science classes away in high school | I went to college with someone who had an STI and would have unprotected sex with people because ‚Äúif it‚Äôs not external, it‚Äôs not contagious.‚Äù She graduated with a Neuroscience degree | Before ""flat earthers"" were really a thing people were aware of, my sister was friends with one. When he first told me he believed the earth was flat, I was sure he had to be pulling my leg. Nope. He would deliberately try to have a conversation about it with me every time I saw him, and I hated him. I couldn't for the life of me understand how someone in this day and age could possibly think the earth was flat. No amount of logical reasoning would convince him otherwise.  He died last year, and I feel terrible for saying so, but I'm actually relieved. | That rocks are in fact not alive.

That it shouldn't be legal for parents to kill their children. 

That the Big Bang was for the whole Universe, not just the galaxy.

That the weed was not helping your anxiety dude. | Family member. She was convinced that mermaids are real after watching the mockumentary ‚ÄúMermaids: The Body Found.‚Äù She still believes in Bigfoot, and that the earth is only 5,000 years old. Oh, and Darwin is a liar. WTF. There is no way I can get through to her because ‚Äúgod created everything.‚Äù FML. | Working in the construction industry, oil and gas mainly, there are men that do not know that toilet paper and shit goes inside the toilet and not on the stall walls. The infamous ""Poo Bandit"" strikes at every jobsite in the industry. The fact that we have to have meetings with all crafts because some grown ass man decides that poo goes on walls and not the toilet is extremely sad, and I lose hope in mankind everytime we have the meetings. | I had to have a rather loud, aggravating argument *today* with someone about red lights. He just could not fathom why I wasn't going through the intersection despite no one coming... How the actual hell does someone get a license and not understand how red vs green lights work?!? | I wasn‚Äôt motivated in High School and didn‚Äôt do great because of it. I missed being in the top 20% by a fraction of a GPA point and was the 120th highest scoring student out of 600ish people. 

I knew the girl who was the 119th. She was dumb as a board. She explained to the class that our exchange student was from India. Another girl said that she admired asian culture and was excited to meet the student. #119 rolled her eyes, exclaiming, ‚ÄúShe is from IN-DI-A. Not Asia. We aren‚Äôt having any Chinese exchange students.‚Äù 

They went on for so long because she did not understand that Asia was not a country and that Asia was not just China.

After high school, I got my motivation back and now have a PhD. She dropped out of nursing school after trying to go to community college for 4 years. I think she has some kids and her boyfriend‚Äôs most definitely cheating on her. Oh well. | That 50% off of 25$ is 12.50 

I used to work in retail and I had a lot of dumb arguments, but this was probably the dumbest. She fully believed that it was $10 and I even pulled out the calculator and google to show her and she refused to believe me. 

Eventually, the people in line behind her got pissed so she paid, but she left grumbling that I don‚Äôt know math. | At a party in my twenties a girl said I love bananas but hate the way they make it kinda hard to breathe and make my throat all scratchy. I tried desperately to explain that she was allergic to bananas and that bananas didn‚Äôt do that to everyone. I probably spent an hour talking to every last person at that party trying to explain that she was the only one that experienced it but she refused to believe any of us because she ‚Äúate them all the time.‚Äù | I don‚Äôt get into arguments much. | Me 27 at the time, sitting at a coffee shop at one of the bigger tables when no one was there because they have the nice power outlets tucked underneath that are easy to access since I work remotely and travel. 1 and half hours roles by and I get a tap on the shoulder from an older say 65 ish year old lady and her 4 friends and she asks in a hasty tone,  ‚ÄúCould you move we have a bigger party and really need this table‚Äù I sat there for a second, two, three, ‚Ä¶ I say‚Ä¶ ‚Äúplease?‚Äù  She looked at me bewildered as if manners were above her. Her friend jumped in and said , ‚Äúif it‚Äôs not too much , could you move so we can use this table, please? also what are you drinking I will get you another cup of coffee on me and a snack‚Äù with a charming smile and a half wink.

Now, I was sufficed at please but another coffee and a snack to boot? Oh yes of course sit right down. The original gal sort of gave me a blank look but I was happy to move for the second. 

5 minutes later , ‚Äúas promised , thanks for moving , we like this place for our monthly book club, don‚Äôt mind her she‚Äôs just like that‚Äù as she hands me the drink and an a blue berry muffin. At this point I felt bad and my face had shifted from slightly annoyed to a bit guilty for having to go through with something that dumb. ‚ÄúI do appreciate this‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWell, just keep it in mind for the next person will ya? A little bit of courtesy never hurt anyone, someday ya might need something too‚Äù with that same charm from before. With a smile of acknowledgement she had walked off to join her friends. 

No matter how old you are you‚Äôre not above manners and I will remember her approach from now on. | Well today in customer service, it was that you do, in fact, have to click your cart to find the ""move to check out"" button.

 Apparently every single website he's ever purchased from will take him straight to check out without him having to do anything else. So he's mad the website I run for work is broken and that I had the audacity to suggest he should try clicking a button.


 It was a long conversation, and I'm still wondering what websites he's been using that he couldn't figure out how to find the checkout button. | How it's immoral for my buddy to share his gf nudes even if she hadn't specifically asked him not to. 

Then, he brought it up while she was in front of all of us to see if she would side with him. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How she didn't leave him right there is beyond me. | That in the hospital there's still an expectation that patients need to be doing the same stuff for themselves that they would be doing for themselves at home (barring of course some kind of injury or chronic health condition or cognitive impairment). I have lost count of the number of times perfectly independent patients act like their arms are painted on and want someone else to wash their genitals or do ADLs (activities of daily living) themselves that they're fully capable of doing. It can be really frustrating because then it takes away time from us to use on those other patients who are fully dependent on us Nurses to meet their basic needs.

I will never forget one fellow who didn‚Äôt have any fresh underwear so he was provided with a Pull up pad (diaper) as an alternative because we don't carry spare supplies of underwear, and he proceeded to shit his pants and requested to be cleaned up when he was perfectly capable of walking to the toilet just a couple of metres away and wiping his own backside... as he did the day before. SMH. | ""Math is a western invention that is racist against Indians and a symbol of Imperialism""

My dude, Indians invented the concept of 0 as modern society understands it.

We would not have modern mathematics without it. | Had a customer bring an item to me (for 'return') that we did not sell. Along side it he gave a receipt from our chain, listing a completely different item that is 10x more expensive than the physical item he brought. He was so mad that I refused to give him credit for the receipt when he brought me a completely different item, that I couldn't take back if I wanted to. It took a solid 5 minutes of back and forth before he took everything back and stomped out of the store. Calling me a dumb bitch all the way out. | Expectation does not mean agreement. | This guy thought the moon was a plasma ball projected from earth. He was a cool guy until he said that | Post-2020, when we opened back up, there was a strange person at the library that fervently believed we had been infiltrated by a ""deep-state propaganda artist"" because we had a political section of non-US governments. Not only this, that same person decided to use the computer to *attempt* to print out an obviously fake state ID for himself. When questioned, he supposedly said, verbatim, ""I am anarchy."" | That a day is not, in fact, one full trip around the sun.¬† | I‚Äôm had an argument with a coworker and very good friend who was in his late 50s at the time about tax brackets

He was very misinformed and thought moving up a tax bracket in the US made you owe more instead of the stepped system that it actually is.

I literally had to pull up the tax code at the bar and show him

I give him credit as he has relented on his position almost immediately, but it boggled my mind that this man had been working for over 30 years and thought if you moved into a new tax bracket all your money you earned was taxed higher.

Asked him how they went to the moon several times. Fake moon landing says him. Asked about going to the space station, internet hoax says him.

I had to try and explain to someone who was visiting my country (in Europe) that no, we are not just another state and that there is a thing called *countries* that are not states and are not a part of the US.

He insisted that while he understands we call them countries because they are farther away from the main land, they are still part of the US because the U stands for United so all countries participate.

I tried explaining that Independence Day wouldn't make sense if all countries were just parts of the US (from who were they celebrating independence then?), nothing.

I pointed out we had a completely different government. Nope.

I showed him on Google where the US boarders are and how many different countries there are on a map. Couldn't understand it.

He was convinced that we are just bitter here because we are not real Americans like they are. | I had to explain to my college classmate that ducks and geese are not the same thing. I also explained, to the same classmate, that they have to capitalize ‚ÄúI‚Äù when writing and any other noun that needs capitalization; not just the first letter of the first word of a sentence. They ‚Äúdropped out‚Äù of college after the first semester.

I also have a friend who thought the Grand Canyon separated the US and Canada. I had to explain that the Grand Canyon is nowhere near Canada. Shortly after this conversation she determined it separated the US and Mexico.

My birthday is in June. It was July.

The bodega guy absolutely refused to sell me the cigarettes because I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt turn 18 for another month.‚Äù

We went back and forth for a minute and at one point he listed the months ‚ÄúJanuary, February, March, April, May, JULY, JUNE‚Äù

I could not convince the guy that June actually came before July and had to go somewhere else | That the water from the shower faucet is in no way connected to the toilet water, despite it being in the same room.

I had a woman call and want to speak to rhe electronics manager. At the time the Wii was new and in very short supply, we got tons of calls from people convinced there's some secret stash that only management knows about, or can tell exactly when they came. Anyway, that's only relevant because we basically had to screen calls thoroughly before actually sending to a manager. 


She jeeps insisting that she needs to speak to the electronics manager and I can't possibly help her. There is no point in her talking to me about her issue at all and jeeps asking for the manager. So after like 10 minutes tell her I'll see if I can get one. Welp, dept manager just went home. The assistant manager is off that day. She also didn't want any manager, it had to be one over electronics because her issue requires someone who is an expert on electronics. So I spend another 10 minutes trying to convince her to ask. It can't hurt, worst case she is calling back tomorrow anyway. Then get ""I'll go ahead and ask you, but you won't know"" worded a few different ways. 


"" So, I bought a dvd at Hollywood video yesterday. It says security device enclosed. What does that mean? I've been to afraid to open it."" 


Took a second to compose myself. Told her that it just means there a tag inside that'll set off the alarms at the entrance at stores like Walmart. So u less she's bringing it in, there shouldn't be any issue. It should have deactivated already anyway.


""Are you sure?...... I'll go ahead and open it while on the phone with you just in case."" *Pop* ""oh, okay, thank you"" *hangs up*


This also wasn't an elderly person either. Probably middle aged based on how her voice sounded. Even if you don't know much about technology, what the hell would someone expect?

Just one of those moments that cracks our shared reality a little when you realize a person doesn't understand basic things around them... i mean the guy was counting the little lines on the ruler, the ones he knew to be sixteenths, against the larger ones. | When I was 10 (or around that) my stepdad told me about some soda we had in the fridge though I had just made strawberry milk, he told me either drink the strawberry milk and don‚Äôt have soda (worse option when your 10 and want sugar) or pour it out (which is wasteful) there was plenty of space in the fridge and so I tried putting it there he said no and called me disobedient after a bit more arguing he started to get really mad because I was just asking to put milk in the fridge it‚Äôs kind of funny how stupid the argument was but it escalated

This ended up escalating to me blocking off my door with a mattress (on my own feild with no force I just didint want to leave my room) and I called my dad

I moved on from this argument, my mom divorced him (not because of the milk thing btw) and now there‚Äôs no complaints lol I have had a couple of stupid but bad arguments with him but this has got to take the cake

Blew my mind, as at the time both my mom and I were working CNA/In home care jobs. He would just get super defensive when we wanted to take strict precautions to protect the family AND our residents we would work with! So he would just stay at our house, go to some of the bars that didn't fully shut down, hang at parties, etc. They ended up splitting after the Capitol Attack. He became much more racist, bitter, and delusional! Anyways, the universe must have wanted to pull a joke on the guy because he ended up getting Covid in jail one weekend and had to be on a ventilator for a while. He's lucky to be alive! He still doesn't believe in covid, though. 
I guess you really can't fix stupid. | I went to a QAnon rally one time at the JFK assassination site in Dallas, TX. One lady there told me that Joe Biden was waiting in a nearby sewer drain with a rifle and it was actually Joe who shot JFK.

I never knew that others heard an inner voice that narrates their inner thoughts because I only ever thought visually. Interested, I went to my dad asked if he had one and he said yes. 

I told him that‚Äôs weird because I didn‚Äôt have one and he instantly said ‚Äú*yes you do, everyone does*‚Äù, I responded with ‚Äú*no I don‚Äôt, I think visually*‚Äù he got mad saying that I needed to stop trying be special. Whatever that means.

He got louder each time he repeated himself as an attempt to shut me up, but I just didn‚Äôt comprehend what the issue was. Why is this important to you and why do I *HAVE* to have an inner voice? He ended up just staying silent after

He didn't understand the power of water, I guess, or the concept of time + water = Grand Canyon. I dunno. He told me that I was crazy.

Also had to explain to someone that the moon's glow was actually caused by the sun. | I had to convince a guy that the continent of Africa did, in fact, have water other than rain. We were reviewing a book we'd read for a college literature class about Zimbabwe, and he said they were celebrating the rain ""Because that's the only water they get other than in shipments."" The entire group swiveled to look at him. I asked him what he meant and he pulled up a picture of cargo containers on google and showed everyone, saying ""those colorful containers on ships are all full of water that 1st world countries like the US and Canada ship to places like Africa so they can have water too."" He absolutely swore it was true and would not believe Africa has lakes and rivers too. He said they pour the cargo containers of water into the wells in African villages... I asked what they did in African cities and he laughed. Because Africa doesn't have cities. I wish I was joking.

I also told a coworker I'm allergic to Tylenol, and she gasped and said *""You can be allergic to something other than peanuts!?""* When I asked her what she thought people meant when they were sneezing and said ""I have allergies"" or when they said they're allergic to dogs or something, she said she thought it was a cute name for hayfever because it's similar to peanut allergy. | Violence does not have a gender | That doubling the numbers on ingredients doesn't mean that you double the degrees to put on the oven. | That the meat we call chicken, comes from an animal called a chicken‚Ä¶ | When I was 8-9 our school teacher very proudly was telling us all numbers only go up to 1 million. I had an Encyclopedia Brittanica at home and brought in the volume which showed the names of numbers with 100 zeros (googol) etc, so I received 10 smacks on each palm of my hands with the scary wooden stick. This was a small village school in Pakistan in the 90's, all years/age groups sat in one room, taught by one teacher. Even at that age, I knew the guy was a donut. Years later I heard he went to jail for killing somebody, not too surprised, he really didn't like being wrong. For those interested, he got fired and the house his family lived in came with the job and when the crew arrived to remove his family and belongings he shot somebody. Very sad for his family. | That chickens are more intelligent than rocks. | I had to discuss with my ex-wife that surfing waves is not a regular sport for our son (we're approx 380 km away from any coast). | Had an argument the other day with someone who didn‚Äôt believe dinosaurs were real. | That 90 mins is the same as an hour and a half. | That thunders are not the sound caused by the friction between the clouds but rather by the electricity generated by it | When I was roughly 16, I had a friend of the same age  (technically not an adult, but old enough to know better) ask me why quarters are called quarters‚Ä¶ and I had to explain that it‚Äôs because four quarters equal one dollar‚Ä¶. | You know that weirdly popular saying: ""Imagine someone of average intelligence, half the world is dumber than that""? Yeah having to explain to people that's now how averages work (and no, median doesn't work that way either) is somehow way too common given how obviously flawed that statement is.

She doesn't drive, doesn't work and doesn't have any money. This in of itself isn't a problem and she needs a lot of support.

We went to my partners cousins wedding and took my partners 9 year old daughter with us, lets call her Ellie. As expected, Ellie was full of life, running around with the other kids etc for the entire day whenever she was able to.

Mandy had explained prior to the event that she wouldn't mind staying a bit later than usual (she would usually have to leave around 8/9pm with my father in law). We said that was fine as long as Ellie was fine to stay. Mandy had no other way to get to the event, or to get home as she wouldnt have been able to afford a taxi and couldnt drive herself.

It got to about 10pm and all of a sudden (as happens with kids), Ellie got extremely tired and upset. No particular reason for the upset beyond being tired which is normal (I totally get it) and she wanted to go home.

I spoke to Mandy and told her that we had to go. She had a meltdown. In front of Ellie.

Mandy isnt overly sociable and hadn't really spoken to anyone all day. She didnt want to dance or anything. My partner and I tried to include her and check on her throughout the day. It was like having another kid.

So there I was, with a crying 9 year old because she was tired and a crying 28 year old woman because she didnt want to go home. Mandy had no understanding of why that was inappropriate or how it would have made Ellie feel.

The other one chimes in, ""well if you can ride a dinosaur surely you could teach..."" completely nonchalantly like that's a thing everyone knows to be true.  Then he went on about how the Bible says it was a thing and some Mayan carvings depict dinosaurs being riden around and used like beasts of burden Flintstones style. | Had to explain to a taxi driver in the US that we speak English in England. | That Tom Hanks did not purposefully introduce Covid19 into Australia with a diseased typewriter. Hanks collects and uses typewriters and the machine he was travelling with was made by Corona.

If you can't tell already, the person I was arguing with was into all the QAnon stuff and all that goes with it. | When I was in high school (15ish at the time) one religion teacher tried to convince me that 2000 years ago people actually lived 800 years. 

I spent 20 minutes arguing that that was not true and that people live way longer nowadays. In the end she just shushed me and said I was not allowing her to continue her lesson. | I had to argue with my father that he needs to wash his hands after using the bathroom, because he stopped doing so for some reason.

He declared his hands aren't dirty because he didn't touch anything, to which I had to point out he would have at the very least touched the toilet lid and the flusher.

I managed to get him to do so, yet he refused to dry his hands with the hand towel and instead insisted upon using the hanging bath towels that people dried their asses with. | my ex really thought trees weren't ""alive"". | I once argued with my older brother about the moon. One day we were out for a walk and he looked up and noticed the moon was out during the day. He came to the conclusion that something was terribly wrong and that the world was going to end because 'the moon is never out during the day, foo. In all my life I never seen the moon out during the day. This is f\*\*ked up, foo.' 

I told him that it was completely normal and happens regularly, and he called me 'f\*\*king stupid.' I was really upset that he wouldn't believe me, especially because I was in college at the time and had just finished a semester in which I took an astronomy class. I tried to dismiss it but then he continued to insult me, something like 'You taking space class and don't know the moon is only supposed to be out at nght, foo? You ain't learning sh\*\* in college. You're a dumba\*\*.' I then called him f\*\*king stupid in return. A little more than that was exchanged but I can't remember the details now.

After I got home later that day, I felt like I didn't want to talk to him for the rest of the week. The rest of the week turned out to be over 2 years, probably due to pride. He didn't call or text me, I didn't call or text him. It took our father being deported and our little brother becoming homeless for us to eventually reconnect. | Two of my colleagues did not know who Christopher Columbus was. | I knew a guy who was convinced that Obama learned about socialism as a college student in Colombia.

1. The holocaust isn't real and never happened, nobody died and there are Jews hidden somewhere in the world. It was all staged for 'political reasons'.
2. The earth is flat and won't go ever go to Australia out of fear of falling off the edge of the world to his 'ultimate death'.
3. COVID wasn't real, and all the deaths have been faked. He has also slipped up once and said it is real, but it's created by 5G towers, as well as refusing to get COVID jabs due to them being a 'government scheme' that allows works as a tracker.
4. He doesn't believe in marriage, so him and his girlfriend (she is unbelievable chilled out yet is somehow still with this lunatic) have been together 20 something years as bf and gf.

I really wish this was a shit-post. He also smokes a lot of weed. | I had to explain to an American that saying African deserved slavery because they were too dumb to create guns to defend themselves was horribly wrong. 
He legit thought black people were inferior race because they just ‚Äòlet slavery happen‚Äô. 
I tried to open his mind and saying maybe they were smart enough to no need to shot themselves with gunpowder like white people did but hey I was 19F and he was 30M so anything I was saying was stupid anyway. 

I could see he would not change his mind so i just walked away. 

It still scares me to think about it, I hope he dies alone. | At one job I worked there were multiple lively conversations discussing whether a ship is a boat or if a boat is a ship. | That meat originally comes from animals and not just from the shop.

I did my best to explain it to him, but to this day I don't think he fully believes me. | That you can‚Äôt round up time.

Seriously‚Ä¶we almost came to blows over this. A coworker would say the time and I‚Äôd look and it was never right. Finally when I asked she said well I rounded it up‚Ä¶

Upon further questioning she provided these examples:

12p to 1215 is 12
1215 to 1230 is 1230
1230 to 1245 is 1245
1245 to 1 is 1p 

When I said that‚Äôs not technically hot time works she said yeah it is. So I asked why she didn‚Äôt use that time when starting and stopping work. I mean if that‚Äôs how time works then our employer would know that too. She said that was different. 

It was at this point in the conversation I had to walk away. | That eggs are in fact, not a dairy product. | Long story short, it was a different topic - but basically 1lb of feathers is the same weight as 1lb of rocks. It was in the terms of grain. They thought no way could 20lbs of whole kernel grain weigh 20lbs after it was milled to a flour. I had to explain that 20lbs is 20lbs whether it was whole kernel or milled. | That Salmon, in fact is actually a fish‚Ä¶.
I kid you not! | A man and his wife pulled in behind my coworker  (22F) and started asking her what her problem was. This was in the parking lot to our job. She was obviously very scared of him and none of them knew I was in the car beside her and could hear him yelling and cussing at her. Apparently she was running late and had been fussing to herself in her car because dude was driving slow. So he made sure to go around the parking lot so he could pull in right behind her and start arguing. He kept asking if she had some kind of F-ing problem and why she wouldn‚Äôt get out of her car so I (27F at the time) jumped out of my car and told him to go the fuck on. The look on his ugly cage was hilarious. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having a conversation with this lady, butt out of it‚Äù he said. I told him it didn‚Äôt seem like much of a conversation to me, yelling at a young lady and trying to interrogate her for having a bad morning. Go the fuck on asshole. All he could think to say back was fuck you, to which I promptly yelled it back louder. We did that a couple more times and finally I was like is this all you‚Äôre going to do today? Yell at a bunch of women? And then his wife got out and was like ‚Äújust go inside, leave him alone‚Äù mam?? He started attacking my friend first?? How about you leave? There was so much more that was said between us all but honestly it was the stupidest argument I‚Äôve ever been in and it ain‚Äôt worth typing it all out. | I once had to argue with an adult about why they shouldn't leave their dirty dishes in the office kitchen for days. It was wild because it felt like common sense, but apparently, it wasn‚Äôt. | I had to convince someone that lions and tigers are two separate species of animals, not just male and female versions of the same species. | My wife (maybe 27 at the time?) was certain that BBQ ribs came from a chicken. The rack of ribs which is as big as the bird itself. It took entirely too long to convince her that they came from a pig. | That lint rollers are not one time use, the sticky part peels back. | In an argument over money, I had to explain to a 35 year old woman that a cheque was exactly like cash. Their argument was they can write a cheque without having money in their account so a cheque was a promise to pay money in the future.

Explained the amount of the cheque was debited from your account regardless if the money was there or not, because you know, the shop doesn't know you have no money when you hand the the cheque over. She wouldn't accept cheques are the same as cash and are treated the same.

She worked in financial services and claimed she knew better. This is why when I realise I'm arguing with an idiot, I back off. | My stepdad. who has a PhD in Physics and literally WROTE HIS THESIS on thrust dynamics for space launch.... thinks the Moon Landing was faked. 

I didn't argue - only because no matter what I say I can't POSSIBLY know what I'm talking about. | That its wildly inappropriate and emotionally abusive to tell a teenager their father wanted to abort them in order to manipulate the teenager into not wanting to live with their father. | I work retail... | Arguing that vaccines don't cause autism. | You can be white and from Mexico. This Mexican girl, who had been born and raised in the states, was talking about her abuela in Jalisco. I went, ‚Äúomg that‚Äôs where my abuela is from!‚Äù She deadass went, ‚ÄúDude, you‚Äôre white.‚Äù Like I didn‚Äôt know???? My dad is from Mexico. He was raised there. His mom was Mexican and his dad was Irish. And my egg donor was Irish. Of course I‚Äôm pale. But that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not Mexican. I just have more Irish. | A patient of mine kept insisting that we list female on their patient profile. I felt incredibly stupid when I explained that even though transgender HRT did alter their biological makeup, they were still male for medical purposes, and as such, would still need screenings for things like testicular and prostate cancer, the latter of which could still remain a risk even after reassignment surgery.

The patient ended up crying, but I'm not really sure why. I thought the entire discussion was really fucking dumb. | That horse dewormer doesn't cure Covid.

That voting for a guy convicted of 34 felonies while trying to cover up hush money he paid to a porn start he fucked while his third wife was pregnant with his forth child, was not a good idea. | Almost every day is the amount of alcohol in a daiquiri that they ""can't taste.""  
it's 1.5 oz to a shot and 3 oz of incredibly strong flavor and ice.
the point is not to taste the liquor. | ‚ÄúWe need to go back to when America was great!‚Äù 

I‚Äôm sorry. When was America great for any African American/immigrant or anyone who wasn‚Äôt a white male? Please tell me, because I am eager to know. I just can‚Äôt get past this. When do you want to go back to? The 60/70‚Äôs? The 30/40‚Äôs? | That Covid isn‚Äôt a hoax devised by the libs. According to this idiot it‚Äôs just a rebranded flu that democrats created to sabotage the US economy. | Man vs Bear. | While changing a tire:

*after 10 minutes of laughing while watching my husband attempt to use a bike pump on a rotted doughnut*

""[Husband] this has gone from extremely funny to painful, quit doing that""

""How are we supposed to drive it there, huh? It's so flat it'll pop""

""Use the racing jack next to you, leave it on the jack stand, we put the tire in the back seat of mom's car, go put air in it, patch it, then drive back and put the wheel back on""

""Oh"" 

""Yeah. Oh.""

""You technically left the part where we dig the screw out of it off that list""

""Grow up"" | I had an argument with my aunt one time. She‚Äôs into astrology but claims tera cards are fake. I then proceeded to explain to her why astrology is also bs. I tired to explain what Milankovitch cycles are and that due to them the signs she believes in are have actually shifted. I also explained that the whole system is based on a geocentric model. And that science has progressed. She told me to stop insulting her. 

I do believe events in space affect life on earth. But like solar flares, cosmic rays, and astroid impacts. | I had to argue with my high school *American Government teacher* that the governmental system of the United States of America is a **Republic** and not a **Democracy.**

I ended the argument with the only mic-drop moment I've ever had in my life by opening *her textbook* and reading ""America is a constitutional republic"" from it.

I've had this argument with plenty of folks since then and it kinda makes sense with most people. We always talk about democracy and our democratic values, so it can be confusing. A democracy is when the citizens directly vote on the issues themselves. A republic is when citizens vote for representatives to vote on issue for them. USA has democratic *values* but is not itself a democracy. | That voting to give the nuclear codes to a sleaze ball reality tv star is not a good idea. | Why anyone is pro-Trump | I (a female) had to explain to my friend (a male) how to check his oil (he didn‚Äôt know you had to) AND explain why the oil was low. He didn‚Äôt understand why it would be low because he hadn‚Äôt taken any oil out. When I checked it, it had A quart of oil.  üò≥  I really wanted to have a talk with his father. | I'm sure we've all met someone who obstinately confuses ""global warming"" with ""seasons changing"".

**""It's winter here!  Gosh, it's cold.  I sure could use some of that global warming I've heard about!""** | Not voting for someone with 34 felony convictions. | About 10 yrs ago‚Ä¶Grown man‚Ä¶that Dragons used to exist | They thought the Earth was flat. | That I broke the work printers on purpose. Boss had the mind of a toddler telling me, ""I'm seeing a pattern.,""
 Anyway, that and any argument went like Firefox logo downloading a page only to get a 404. | My work line was VOIP and speed tests repeatedly showed that my speed was 296KBS.  That's right, kilobytes, not megabytes. I argued with tech that my VOIP wasn't working because as they claimed ""the speed was too fast"". | I honestly wasn‚Äôt prepared when I was ‚Äúconfronted‚Äù by two of my friends because they didn‚Äôt like that I was friends with their former friend. Mind you, we were all 22-25. I was like, did I just go back in time to middle school?üòÇ | Why Logan Airport was STILL closed two weeks after 9/11. | The importance of being on time. | Deadass me and my friend, playing zomboid dude got infected by a laceration or some shit, gets stuck in a vehicle claiming it‚Äôs a glitch and wants god mode, I say no but teleport him out because he was literally stuck. He ends up dying, he claims it was from corpse sickness from being stuck for 5 minutes next to zombie composes (which is impossible btw, you don‚Äôt get 100% corpse sickness from that in 5 mins)but we claim it was from a healed wound that gave him the zombie virus. Friendship ended just like that cus he claimed we were gaslighting: 10+ years down the drain. Long story short: friend dies in video game, we don‚Äôt believe friends reason for dying, he thinks we gaslight and blocks us. | I had a person with a degree looking at me smug and suspicious when I told her that no, venous blood is not greenish blue, even if veins on your wrists look that colour. She even mentioned her education to try and pit me down.
It was a course for early childhood teachers. I mean, probably to this day that b*tch walks around having power over children. Gives me the shivers. | To take out the trash. When I was in college I lived with two girls who refused to take out the trash. They would create, not an exaggeration, 8 bags of trash in a week. They would both say it wasn't theirs so I'd be forced to do it. On top of all this, the dumpster was a 10 minute walk from our place and a 2 minute drive. Both of them had cars, I did not. So I had to make multiple trips walking back and forth taking out garbage that was not mine. I tried everything to get them to take out the trash: calmly discussing it with them, being assertive, and eventually just being an asshole about it. Nothing worked. | A former friend came over for a dinner party, tried to cook something, STARTED A HUGE FUCKING GREASE FIRE ENDANGERING MY HOUSE AND 14 OTHER GUESTS, and tried to argue that I was ""overreacting"" when I told her she was never ever allowed in my house again. | I had this argument when I was six with my first grade teacher Mrs. Petrison...

She said 0.12 was larger than 0.3. 

She eventually sent me to the principal's office for insubordination. | Miraculous supplements offered by someone who got roped into MLMs |  That ‚Äúpraying mantis‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have a plural. She was my teacher and I was 12. | The U.S. has 50 states -- not 52. You're thinking of cards in a deck. | I once had to explain to a ~70ish year old woman that a plastic cup filled with cold water from a plastic pitcher which was filled with cold water from a soda fountain could not carry an electric charge of any kind and therefore was not ""electrified"" and didn't shock her lips when she drank. What she experienced was called ""COLD"".

Got accused of patronizing her and then she left. | Imagine driving to a location on a normal grid-type street pattern. That location is not on a straight line from your location, so that means, at the very least, there are two ways to get there: over and down, or down and over. Follow? 

I chose to drive the way that wasn't the passenger's preferred route. Same distance, same time, just different route. But somehow I was wrong. | I had to explain to my 24 year old nephew the difference between East & West and Left & Right. I honestly don't know what he was confused about or how to even describe it. He just didn't seem to understand that East is East no matter what direction you are facing. | She believed that she cannot eat mayonnaise while pregnant because there is risk of salmonella. She also believed that kids can only drink warm milk because cold milk will give them a tummy ache. | Baked is one syllable | Please at the very least use deodorant. | A contrator destroyed my upstairs bedroom & wanted to be paid for his ‚Äúwork‚Äù. | It's not my intention to persuade you that flying deer drive Santa Claus' travel time‚Äîthey are real. | I have a twenty year old son who argues ridiculous things all the time. Nearly impossible to say something that isn't refuted.¬† | Chemtrails.  Telling me about some organization putting chemicals in the air from passenger airliners.  I tried to explain about condensation and all that but they didnt want to listen so I just smiled and nodded my head | How a rocket supposedly can't work in space because ""there's nothing to push against in a vaccuum"". | Had to explain to someone why New York is on the east coast. | I had an employee argue with me that a Lamborghini must take at least $300 to fill up with gas. (Sorry to any USA citizens, but I don't use freedom units) Gas at the time was ~$1.85/L, I googled to find out that most Lambos this day have an 85L gas tank, so I showed him the math that it would actually be $157.25 to fill up from empty. His response was ""Yeah but it's got a V12 engine in it. You gotta fill that up too."" ... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è He worked for me in retail while he went to school to be a mechanic. I told him to always put me down as a reference so I know which shop he works at so I know where to not take my vehicles. | This is the most common of course, that you cannot pause an online game. Everyone knows this by heart | ‚ÄúIf you keep rolling back on me, I can‚Äôt wipe your butt, and it will keep burning, and it will only get more painful. So please (name). Let. Me. Wipe. You.‚Äù | I was explaining the price changing process to a coworker. I told her to scan the tags from left to right, from top to bottom like reading a book. She told me she couldn't do that because she was left-handed and her brain worked backwards. She was in her 40's. | My step dad did the cliche eating a chunk of ice cream to explain how taxes work.
I was 9, and I knew that schools, libraries, and the parks I went to were paid for with taxes. | Bro was absolutely convinced that women pee out of their assholes. | A coworker of mine didnt know unprotected and protected sex can cause pregnancy. He was trying to teach me about it. I tried to explain i already knew. He insisted there was no way i couldve known that. We argued for a few minutes until he came to the realization that he didnt pay attention during high school sex education and i did. | For some background, I work in a pizzeria. This particular day we opened at ten but like most places we get in a hour or so early to prep. Part of that prep is using wet rags to prevent trays and whatever else from moving. The rags are re used but are washed the night prior and kept soaking in a bin overnight. Anyway the morning crew was myself and three others. One on counter and three in the back, simple. About an hour into the shift I realized I'm missing my wet rag to lay out some dough. I think ""oh well, we have plenty from last night let me grab a wet one from the clean bin"". There was only one left and since it was an hour in I assumed everyone had their wet rags and just grabbed it. Co worker asked if someone took the rag from the bin. Me being honest admits to taking it and he starts arguing about it. His points being that since it was clean and alone in the bin it shoulda been obvious it was someone else's. I rebuttal with the fact he shoulda spoke up that it was his in the first place and that something in the clean bin from last night for more than an hour into our shift isn't obviously claimed and even then it's just a rag.
Go get another one from the dry bin and soak it. The argument lasted an unnecessary 10 minutes and peeved me off for a bit | I‚Äôm the dumb one hear. I believed for a while that Boston was a state‚Ä¶.My family still brings it up 8 years later. I blame the public education system in Texas. | Not necessarily an argument but I worked at Jersey Mikes and a lady came in and asked how big our ‚Äúgiant‚Äù size sandwich was. I showed her one of the loafs and explained it was fifteen inches long. She followed up with ‚Äúis that bigger than a footlong?‚Äù. I had to explain more than once that the fifteen inch sub was indeed larger than a 12 inch footlong from subway. Lady was serious the entire time too | Whilst working a telephone for a certain motel chain, I had to explain to a gentleman that even though there were rooms when he called yesterday, without reserving one we couldn‚Äôt guarantee that any would be available upon his arrival. He refused to listen, insisting the previous guy he‚Äôd spoken to had promised him a room, and we had to honour our word. It was exhausting.

Thank goodness it was a call centre job, my heart goes to the people behind the desk who have to deal with these people in person. | The world is not flat | That, after starting the engine and with the car stopped, consumption as l/100km or mpg, is impossible to calculate. | I worked at a restaurant and a woman ordered a dish with chickpeas and asked if they were actual chickpeas or just garbanzo beans. She told me she is allergic to garbanzo beans and can only have ""real"" chickpeas. She wouldn't even believe me after I pulled up the google results to show her they are the same thing. | This probably isn't that surprising, but I was in a guild for the online game World of Warcraft. One of my guild mates kept insisting white people could use the ""N"" word and that it was ""no longer racist."" Trying to convince him was like talking to a drunken toddler. A big part of why I stopped playing multiplayer games in general. So many toxic idiots. He was married and in his mid 20's. | A teacher in middle school told me dead serious that water is ALWAYS blue. | Had a lady blow up at guest service because she couldn't return clothes that not only did she not have with her, but had no evidence that she even bought. No receipt with the actual items on it even though she vehemently claimed that was the correct receipt. Wanted to return imaginary clothes she didn't even pay for. | It involved flushing the toilet at night. My roommate didn't see the need for it. | That the moon sets. I was briefing a Colonel, and he tried to tell me that the moon doesn't set. | That at a Pizza Hut buffet we're not going to make custom pizzas, cheese sticks, or wings to put out there. The items on a P-Hut buffet have been the same for decades. He also was convinced that saying ""my children aren't eating"" meant they wouldn't be charged, despite them having two plates in front of each of them, making a mess of said plates, and their water cups being now half filled with the parents' sodas. Mind you, the buffet was 5 bucks for adults and maybe 3 for kids, and the kids were around 10. | That it‚Äôs not ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to have homicidal thoughts. My brother and I spent 5 minutes trying to tell my mom that it isn‚Äôt really normal to want to kill people, but she kept arguing that ‚Äúas long as [she] doesn‚Äôt act on it, it‚Äôs perfectly okay.‚Äù | My wife and I made the decision to have a child. Shortly after  receiving news that we were successful, the Rona hit. We had to give up a lot a things, such as baby showers and family get together, but we happily did it for our upcoming child. When our child was finally born, we were still in the heart of Rona, but there was news of the vaccine coming out soonish.

So, we made the decision that nobody was aloud to come see the new baby until they had gotten their shots. Everybody respected it and found it reasonable. Except for my mother. 

My mom lives on the other side of the country and was very excited to fly in to see him. And even though I told her not till she's had her shots and to not buy tickets yet, she bought them anyway. I was mad. I told her she's either going to have to get them refunded or extended till she's vaccinated. As we've told her repeatedly. But she absolutely lost it. She ended up sending me and my wife a very long and passive aggressive text about how disrespectful we are and how we're purposely keeping her out of our life. It resulted in a very heated phone call. She said some absolutely vile things about my wife, and I did lose my temper at that point and told her not to call back till shes calmed down. 

Eventually, I half forgave her and did let her come see her grandchild after she was eventually vaccinated. I've now set ground rules, and it has helped. But our relationship has been damaged from her own passive aggression and manipulations. I don't let it affect me to much, but the damage has been done. | I was pulled over once for speeding. Going 60 in a 65. Officer said they had to speed up to 75 to catch up to me, so that means I was also going 75. | God | Last week - To go to the ER for chest pain or not. Not an argument but a stubborn ‚ÄòI‚Äôm man blah blah blah‚Äô. Turned out to be nothing at all. Here come the bills! The alternative was being wrong and pushing daisies, right? Turned out to be a nasty virus that has knocked my ass down. | Someone thought if you wore a condom that you could not get a partner pregnant.

They also thought if a woman is on a birth control pill, they did not need to wear a condom.

To be fair, I think this is less a product of their shortcoming and more a product of a shitty sex education system in the states. I think there's a lot of intelligent people undereducated about sex. | Stupidity and lies | I'm agnostic and grown ass men can't handle the fact I don't believe in their god. Admitting that ""I don't know and not going to pretend I do"". Is the same as ""hail satan"" | That being a slave was worse than being a woman during the civil war era - they believed it was pretty much equal | My first girlfriend (yes, I never had one as a teenager lmao) learned from me that MPH meant Miles Per Hour...and that that meant how many miles you'd go in an hour at that rate...not just ""a random number on the dashboard"" ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è | This past week I had an argument with someone on here (my mistake, to be fair). At one point they threw out a fact that was wrong as part of their argument - namely, they said that there are more bisexual men and gay women. In reality, it is the opposite; there have been many studies across multiple Western nations proving this as fact. I added links to some of these studies.¬†

They argued that the studies must have been a misrepresentation ""by straight people"" (for what reason, I cannot imagine.)¬†

THEN, when I asked why they believed that, they said that it was because that was what they see on TV and online. Saying they trust studio execs more to represent the truth.

Can't make this shit up. | I got into an argument with someone who thought ""Popeyes Chicken"" was pronounced ""Pope Yes Chicken""... yeah... Pope Yes... and the saddest part was that I couldn't change their mind. | I had to scream at a senior manager for a large insurance company on the phone, after I realized he was intentionally not renewing our policy. Did all sorts of work on our house, then the insurance company gave us a NEW LIST OF WORK to do. I screamed so much at that man. And he couldn‚Äôt care less. Most bizarre conversation I‚Äôve had with another adult human.

I wish he‚Äôd have just said their company was losing tons of money and doesn‚Äôt want our business.

Would have saved me $20K I didn‚Äôt HAVE to spend. | I was a back seat passenger at night on the freeway. I noticed the (female) driver had the HIGH beams on so I mentioned it. She said ""High beams are for the highway."" | Had to explain to my absolute cuntbiscuit of a landlord once that no, the lid of the slow cooker I had recently bought was not too small and was in fact, loose for a reason. I'm not a scientist by any means, but even I know that if there's nowhere for steam to escape, pressure will build and soon you'll have an even bigger problem on your hands. This man is a university professor, has his own Wikipedia page and everything üòí Thank fuck I'm no longer in that house. | I worked with a man who was ***adamant*** that we couldn't have gone to the moon because the biblical firmament would have destroyed any rockets we launched, killing the astronauts. He then went to show me videos of exploding rockets and the Columbia disaster to prove his point. 

I tried to explain that there's mirrors on the moon that we use to check is distance every day and that we can see the landing sites with good enough telescopes and that the Russians would have called bullshit if we didn't go because that was peak cold war and embarrassing the USA would have been priority #1 for them, but he wasn't having it. Weird old boomer... | That 4*.25=1

I went to give my daughter some melatonin so she could sleep well ahead of a big day. My mom said she had some 2 mg gummies I could give her. I told her I didn't want to give her that much, but I had some liquid that was .25 mg/ml. When I went to give her 4 ml my mom starts flipping out saying if 2mg was too much then why would I give her that much? I broke it down for her but she insisted that was entirely too much. She couldn't tell me how much it was, but that it was definitely way more than 2 mg.

When I got tired of arguing about it I said ""geez, I guess I've temporarily stupid"" and she replied with ""yeah, I guess so.""

What made this extra baffling is that I consider my mom to be amongst the most intelligent people I've ever known, I don't know what had gotten into her that night. | Back in middle school I had to inform a teacher that no she wouldn‚Äôt get AIDS from sharing a cup of water with someone | Don't smoke weed when you're pregnant. Not even for morning sickness. | A coworker with a college degree argued that y=mx+b was not slope intercept form, but something else entirely, and also that it was a specific formula used only for a very specific singular line rather than a general formula. I am sure she cheated through college or something. | Had a friend years ago who believed the sun was smaller than both Earth and the moon, simply because the moon sometimes looks larger in the night sky. He could not grasp that the sun was over 90 million miles away, and that was the reason that it looked small in the sky. This guy was in his mid twenties at the time. | That ""Fish and Chips is not a heathy meal"". My Dad sitting in the ER room waiting to be seen with digestive problems insisting that he's been ""eating healthy"" by eating Fish and Chips. The waiting room around him was laughing thinking ""he can't be serrious?"". | 4:45. And ‚ÄúA quarter until 5:00‚Äù are the same time. | Argued with a co-worker a few years older than me that, no, her cousin did not use abortion as a form of birth control and no, her cousin did not get an abortion every 2 weeks.

I don't even know her cousin, but that seems like common sense. | To be fair, I have to think about this every time I'm at the deli. | That $20 can buy many peanuts | I'm always amazed at the number of women who have to ""ask"" or ""remind"" their men to brush his teeth | The classic ‚ÄúNuh uh.‚Äù and ‚ÄúYuh huh.‚Äù | During covid I was getting a coffee at a self serve coffee place and a woman got so mad at me for not using a plastic glove to grab a lid.

She was totally baffled that I expected her to pay me back for totaling my car. | My friends ex not understanding that coffee is supermarkets from a coffee machine isn‚Äôt free. I work in a supermarket atm while I‚Äôm at uni and I shit you not this woman just gets a coffee and walks around without paying. | I used to work as a stocker at a WalMart. Had an elderly lady come in asking for a specific brand of hair dye. We didn‚Äôt carry the brand anymore and I had asked her when the last time she bought something from that brand here was, in which she replied ‚Äúyears ago.‚Äù So i had to explain to her how stores filter through brands and products over time all the time, in which she started insulting me and my capabilities to do my work and ended the sentence with ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs exactly why i‚Äôll be shopping at target for now on.‚Äù and then walked away | Had a dude try convincing me white light  does not exist and it‚Äôs only man made at the same time. | Me: The reason your phone bill is so high is because you haven't paid it for the last three months.

Them: But I didn't use my phone because (whatever excuse) | My friend was trying to tell me that do your taxes annually is better than quarterly because you get more money back. I tried explaining that it's just a ratio that makes it confusing, but that you're getting 4 times the money in 4 times the time so it's technically the same amount you're getting either way. He didn't get it. I then explained that if you got 1000 dollars a month, it would be best to get the money 250 a week at a time. He agreed. Then he said that it's not the same because that's not how real time works. | I haven't had this argument myself, but I've seen it come up plenty of times. That a full grown thinking adult could possibly compare a knife to an AR-15 in killing ability. What a ludicrous argument. Only a moron would make such a statement. | The fact that you CAN treat (not cure, TREAT) HIV so that you‚Äôre not infecting others even when having sex without a condom. Can‚Äôt remember how this debate started, but he lost his marbles and wouldn‚Äôt believe me. Called me an STD protector, whatever the hell that is. | My coworker tried to convince me that cold water boils faster than hot water. | Every argument I have ever had with a two-, three-, or four-year old. | A serious discussion about personal hygiene,  specifically body odors. Yes odors! Before I became a driver for my living, I was a middle supervisor in a warehouse. Warehouse Mgr tasked me with having this talk with a subordinate.  It was so ridiculous to even speak of this, with another (biological) adult.... | Two stories of this sort just came across me recently. One of my friends works at Home Depot and was stopped by a customer in the pesticide section. He was already having a bad day and decided to mess with her a bit. She held up a can of bee killer and asked if it was good for bees. He said he looked at the can and told her ""No ma'am, that's bad for them..."" She glared at him, taking the can, and walked away...

Then, he was standing in the lumber area and a guy walks up to him asking where the 2x4s were. He motioned in their direction and asked how long he needed them. The guy responded that he would need them for awhile since he was building a permanent deck. | Alberta is rat free‚Ä¶and we would like it to stay that way. The amount of dumb shits that argue with me about that makes me so angry | Ma'am this is a Target. | In engineering school we were assigned to design a green technology or device. One of my team mates wanted to put a wind mill on an electric car. An engineering student wanted to design a PERPETUAL MOTION MACHINE. 

I was the only one on the team to stand up to them and said I will do literally any idea but that and I will under no circumstances put my name on that stupid shit. | That a cow doesn't produce milk without getting impregnated every year. It was with an otherwise normal man in his fifties. He legitimately believed cows produce milk for people and that's it. | I once had to convince someone that her idea to ‚Äúabolish time zones‚Äù was flawed. As in fuck you Australia it‚Äôs 2pm and pitch black because Aunt Moron here is tired of figuring shit out. | That the sky is not blue because it reflects the ocean | That the fruit roll-ups were not for eating! They‚Äôre for sex! | That buying 25 powerball tickets or 100 powerball tickets is not significantly better than buying just 1 powerball ticket.   Because when the odds are 292 million to one, that minor improvement of the odds is not worth the damage to an average person‚Äôs wallet.  Just buy  one ticket, or at least stay within a $10-20

Truly no idea and told me he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt good with seasons‚Äù. | Every fucking argument with my father. He‚Äôs narcissistic and must always be right. Including what he thinks other people‚Äôs boundaries and emotions should be. 

The most annoying one is that he doesn‚Äôt believe lying by omission counts as lying, since if nobody finds out, to him it never happened. Here‚Äôs the thing - he ALWAYS gets caught whether it‚Äôs by me or by my mother. Including when he had an affair, and when he almost accidentally killed my dog. Either he always gets caught or he lies a LOT more than anyone knows. | That tigers and lions were not the same cat. She legitimately thought that the lion was the male and the female was the tiger, and they were the same. Same person also thought giraffes and zebras were the same animal (same as the lion and tiger thing). Also thought Ted Bundy was a character on TV. Had a driver's licence but didn't know which foot you use on the accelerator pedal. I can keep going. | That the moon doesn't make it's own light and that moonlight is just sunlight shining off of it. But then again he thought he was a werewolf or something | I worked as a dishwasher at a restaurant and the prep cook was supposed to take over for me on my lunch break, as we only had one dishwasher and we always needed one working. The guy was just hired and thought he could boss me around, and after I tried explaining to him the reason his dishes were all dirty when they came out of the washing machine, he blew up at me about not knowing what I'm talking about and being just this little kid. I looked at him, then to my boss, then to him, and back to my boss and go ""You're seeing this shit?"". This guy was 39 and thought dishes were clean when they directly at pieces of food all over them. | Moving to a country from another country means you're an immigrants, no matter how long it's been since you immigrated. | Telling a grown man to stop vaping on a train with kids present.

Common sense isnt common anymore. | Today, I had to explain to a grown man that he wasn't entitled to someone else's personal medical information. He still didn't accept my reasons and advised he'd get an attorney. I let him know his attorney wouldn't be entitled to it either. | [deleted] | Had to explain to a grown adult that chocolate milk doesn‚Äôt come from brown cows. The look of betrayal on their face was like I just told them Santa wasn‚Äôt real... again. | I work Customer Service for a ‚Äúrenowned foreign phone company‚Äù for the Spanish market (spain) just today, I had a customer call to complain that we had been assholes to him because, and I quote ‚Äúthe delivery guy came to pick up his scooter (which was the item to be repaired) and demanded to take his router instead (absolutely nonsensical) so I had to give him my router instead of the scooter).

His accountant paid for all of his bills and expenses, dude was completely clueless to the real world. | My idiot brother (43yrs) saw a meme on Facebook that Halloween was on Friday the 13th this year and that it‚Äôs the first time since 666 year ago. He was freaking out and told my Mom (63yrs) and together they began to worry and get themselves in a tizzy. 

I had to explain to them that Halloween was on the 31st this year‚Ä¶ like it is every year. | A forty year old man was convinced men had one less rib than women. I told him to google it in front of me, he googled it for a half hour not believing any of the medical/anatomy sites.

Goats are boys. | Just every conversation I have with my grandparents | A cashier at Lowe‚Äôs struggled for 10 minutes, despite the most gentle prodding I could give to avoid embarrassment, calculating 75% off.
To make it worse, it was 75% off a $10 item.
She radioed someone for help.

I stood there waiting‚Ä¶ I wanted to see how this played out.

A supervisor that overheard part of the conversation then tried to convince her. Leaning back on a wall, she told him she‚Äôs waiting for the person she called on the radio.

Finally, he snapped and told her to charge me $2.50 and went back to his counter.
She was none too pleased. | The fact that there is no way you could actually ‚Äúwork more and get paid less‚Äù such as deciding whether or not to pick up a shift of overtime.  

Certainly strange things can happen in peoples paychecks like as you make more some sort of wage garnishment or child support might go up, but for a plain-vanilla taxpayer with federal state and local taxes, as well as FICA, there‚Äôs no way those rates will add up to more than 100% at any time no matter whether it‚Äôs a giant bonus payment or regular paycheck. | That there was no point in working overtime because most of it went to taxes. I've had this discussion with too many trades people to count. | A former coworker (F, 50's)told me excitedly that her aunt lives at the North pole. I said, ""No way, nobody lives at the North pole. There's nothing up there but ice and wind."" But she insisted tons of people live there, and that little kids send all their letters to Santa there and stuff.

After some gentle prodding, she exasperatedly called her mom who confirmed that the aunt did live in a town called North Pole... In Alaska. Then she pivoted and refused to admit that the actual North pole isn't in Alaska even after I pulled up Google Earth and showed her how much of Alaska was further North than ""North Pole, Alaska"" | That ground beef and steak come from the same animal. | 
A client I worked with told me she found out she was pregnant. She told me she needed a note for her work because she could no longer raise her arms over her head. Apparently the baby would detach from her stomach, her uterus would fall out, strangle the baby with the cord, and the baby would die. 

After I quit blinking, I pulled up a basic image of the female reproductive system. She insisted that the baby was attatched to her stomach. That's how it got food.   I pulled up a detailed example of a pregnant female anatomy and explained the whole system.  She then decided that  her body was different from other women. 

It took a good 15 minutes of further explanation to get her to sort of believe me.. maybe. 

She had an HS diploma and a job and seemed to have a good bead on things.. wow. | That red cardinals are male not female. Dude insisted the females are red | My dad once tried to argue that I don‚Äôt have a lifelong condition (cerebral palsy) that I‚Äôve had medical documents for since I was 2. I have all the markers.

They told me they were very much real.

I thought they weren‚Äôt real because the movie Elf featured a narwhal who spoke to Buddy.

I had a hard time accepting the idea of a sea unicorn being real, but they are super cute, so in the end, I‚Äôm glad they exist. | I‚Äôm a foreman at a roofing company, I‚Äôm 21 and most of these guys are old enough to be my dad. We always ask this  one guy how many pennies are in a dollar, to which he always confidently responds with ‚Äú99‚Äù. We made sure he was for real, and argued it, but he won‚Äôt accept any explanation, not that there‚Äôs much to explain. He‚Äôs not joking either, he‚Äôs kinda just dumb. | I had to tell my friend more than once to close his mouth when he eats. I could hear him smacking his gums over the TV. He's almost 30. Also had to tell him, which he then failed at, how to lift with his knees not his back. I told him to do what I do, which he didn't. | I was cleaning the windows of a Realty office. I do it every year. I don't own the window cleaning company, my friend does, I just go where he tells me. This time, which was my 5th or 6th, the receptionist comes out the door and asks, ""can I help you?""

I said, ""no, I'm good thanks."" and continue to clean windows.

He said, ""did someone ask you to do this?""

I know one of the owners, but independently of this relationship, so I just said ""Yeah, I think Shane did.""

""SHANE asked you do this this?""

""Yes, I do it every year.""

""I've never seen you do this!"" he tells me.

SO I said, ""Someone in your office hires my friend's company to clean the windows every year. You probably see me clean all these windows on this block. I clean the grocery store and the clinic once a month, and you'll see me hanging off the roof of the high rises downtown. We're the only company in town and there are only two of us, so I really do clean ALL the windows."" 

""I've never seen you before in my life!""

""I don't know what to tell you dude! I can stop if you want me to!""

  
""Oh no, it's fine."" Then he walks back in.

What the fuck??? There are SO MANY things that confused me about that. like....even if I hadn't been asked to do it.... I was just washing windows, most people would have been appreciative. but also... It's FAR more likely that I'm telling the truth. The job takes me 20-30 minutes TOPS. It's entirely possible that he just never noticed me do it before than this bizarre situation where a random dude just shows up to clean windows for free and tells you he's been asked to by the company. And at the end of the day, even if you care one way or the other, Why go and be confrontational about it when he offers completely reasonable defense (that also happens to be correct and truthful)? | You should've showed her like they did in kindergarten the pie method lol | Ex Mil stood on the hill McDonald's food is real | I had to explain to THE OWNER OF AN ICE CREQM FACTORY that there is a massive difference in -40¬∞ F and 10¬∞F despite them both being below freezing.

Bankers shouldn't own food establishments. | Not me, but my wife had a long argument with her friend who claimed black bears are the most aggressive of all the bears, and they aren't in the northwest. Yeesh. | Argued with this woman that her baby was 55cm at birth and not 55 inches. I ran out of patience fairly quickly, and stopped because you don‚Äôt win that one. | That Africa is not a country | India is in Asia. If I say ""Asian"" I'm including India. They brought up India like it was on a whole separate continent or something. | A 30 year old with an education from North Carolina asked me if Mummies were real | UK - 

We have rules when it comes to the use of bicycles on pavements. You are NOT allowed to cycle on pavements per the Highway Code. 

I had gone for a walk 2 days following surgery (they suggest you get up and about asap) and I came up to a tight spot between a parking meter and a shop that only fits a single person. I was walking slower than I usually would due to the fact I'd just had surgery. 

A grown arse woman on a bike is behind me on the pavement and keeps using her bell to try to pass me. I don't acknowledge her because she's not meant to be there anyway. As I'm clearing the smaller gap she's saying 'excuse me, excuse me' and as she passes I say 'calm down, you aren't meant to be on the pavement anyway'. This woman stops her bike and turns around to tell me she's allowed to cycle on the pavement and 'how dare I tell her otherwise'. 

We then get into an argument about the Highway Code (I'm not even a cyclist and I know the rules) and she's shouting that she has right of the pavement if there's noone around. Well guess what? I was around! I honestly have never been so pissed off. She was on an expensive bike in bike gear and should know better.

I managed to call her a stupid bitch before she rode off which made me feel a bit better. | A snippit of the argument:¬† ¬†


Me, an Asian: ""Asians aren't white..."" ¬†


My two co-teachers: ""Yes they are! Yes YOU are! Except for Indians! They're black!""¬†¬†¬†

¬†During COVID times, another ""teacher"" argued back and forth with me that Wuhan was in Japan. I'm Japanese-American. I said, ""it's not in Japan. It's in China. Do you want to ask my family who lives in Japan about this, Karen?"" And the teacher asked if they knew because they're from the town next to Wuhan. In fact, she was calling it ""Huwan"" and would not be corrected. I think she just couldn't understand that Japan and China are two different countries. | That toilet paper with literal shit on it goes in the toilet, not the open trash can in the office. Two times they forgot their shitty paper on the sink ledge and had the audacity to be upset that I addressed it with them. | I‚Äôve had to explain to multiple customers of mine over the years that they, don‚Äôt in fact get to have their vehicle repaired AND also keep the check the insurance company sent them. | Brain cancer causing non stop seizures wasn‚Äôt a good reason to leave Jr. year of high school told by all teachers and the school system. Thanks USA, best country in the world right? | Used to work in property management. Explaining to a grown ass woman that rent was still late even though the due date was her birthday. ‚ÄúBut it was my birthday!‚Äù Over and over. | I'll try to keep this from being confusing.  Years ago I was on a church council and I was at our monthly meeting.  Under new business, someone had recently had a wedding at our church and had written a check made out to our church for $100.  This person who wrote the check specifically stated they wanted fifty dollars to go to the organist (Cristi) and fifty dollars to go to the cleaning lady (Verna).  Pretty straight forward, right?  Wrong.  I can't remember the specifics, but this turned into a 20 minute discussion on what to do with the check.  I said cash the check and give out the $100.  That was not the right answer.  They didn't think they could cash the check and do that.  Fast forward 20 minutes and it resolved itself and they were going to give the money to Cristi and Verna.  

Next month at the monthly meeting, under old business, guess what comes up.  Yep, the $100 check.  I'm thinking to myself, I'm living in the bizarreo world.  A friend of mine, Steve, was at this month's meeting (not last months).  Steve is like what is this all about.  I smiled at him and said you're gonna love this.  It was explained again and he said just cash the check and give them the money.  I said I agree, but it isn't that easy.  After discussing it again, it was decided to cash the check and give them the money.  Thankfully it resolved itself this time.  

Bottom line, I lost about 40 minutes of my life discussing what to do with $100 that was specified to give to two people, twice. | Had a huge argument with my grandparents who refused to believe 2nd hand smoke kills anyone. My grandma proceeds to blow smoke in my face. I do not like my grandma. | No Karen, your son isn‚Äôt progressing in math because we suck at our jobs, it‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt bother to check his homework to make sure it‚Äôs correct, which you as a parent are required to do.

There's only so many ways I can rephrase that bro. üò≠ |  The other day I was on Facebook and saw this comment thread:
Commenter 1: ‚ÄúDiluting juice with water removes the nutrients from the water‚Äù 
There were a bunch of replies to it telling the person they were wrong. The next commenter is the one who shocked me. 
Commenter 2: ‚ÄúAll of you are saying she is wrong, but I just looked it up and she‚Äôs right. Diluting juice with water removes the nutrients from it. It removes the sugar.‚Äù
My response to commenter 2: ‚ÄúYeah, it removes the nutrients from the juice because it‚Äôs diluted, but the original comment is talking about it removing nutrients from water‚Äù
Commenter 2: ‚ÄúYeah, so am I. I looked it up and it said it removes the sugar from the water.‚Äù
I then proceeded to explain that there is no sugar in water and how diluting juice works and she doubled down on her internet research. | A group of high schoolers had inform our health teacher with a wife and 3 kids that pee doesn't come out of the vagina and that the urethra is a second hole | I was amazed when I started to meet actual pandemic deniers | Guy couldn‚Äôt understand that you don‚Äôt need religion to tell you what‚Äôs right or wrong.

It was in BFE in the south. Like, 2,000 people in the town and a suspiciously low average IQ. Anyway, I took this job and moved in with an old friend and his wife to save money before the wedding. My friend and his wife were both mid 20s with the wife being a practicing veterinary nurse. A few days before the wedding, the wife-to-be and I are sitting around chatting with this other couple when the wife sneezes. We think nothing of it but she‚Äôs clearly immediately upset. We keep talking and she sneezes again but this time starts apologizing profusely. Weird, but whatever. Eventually, she goes into this sneezing fit which turns out was caused by an allergic reaction to our dog. She was almost hysterical and apologizing over and over again. When we finally asked why she was so upset she said, ‚ÄúYou know! I‚Äôm allergic to your dog and I‚Äôve been sneezing all day. Now you two are going to get sick, right before your wedding!‚Äù We then proceeded to listen to her explain very seriously how allergies are contagious and how she understands if we‚Äôre mad at her for ruining the wedding. We tried so, so hard to explain that it‚Äôs ok because she is in fact wrong, but she could not accept that. Still to this day she is throughly convinced that she almost got us sick because of her allergies to our dog. | Ok this wasn't an argument at all but ppl online were discussing cold brew and more than one person did not understand the 2:1 ratio of milk/water to coffee. My mind was like ??? | Far too many times I‚Äôve had to argue with adults trying to get to drive home shitfaced. Friends, family, strangers. 

Probably hundreds of times throughout my life. Sometimes successful, sometimes not.

Arguing with an old lady about how she can't renew a book because someone else has a hold on it and yes ma'am, you have to share the books in a library with other people that's how libraries work.

Arguing with a middle-aged dude that you have to return books or you'll be charged for them. Dude honestly went through 30-some years thinking that because we didn't charge him when he took the books home, that meant he was free to keep them forever and it took arguing with me, my boss, the library's director, and a library board member (who happened to be there for a meeting with the director) for him to finally understand (and honestly I'm not 100% certain he did). 

Not library related, but I had a patron tell me that it was okay for him to do his grandson's college homework because he was paying for it. That wasn't really an argument, just me smiling and nodding at him while mentally on vacation for 20 minutes.

EDIT - Oh, the old lady who was angry and spitting blood that we put her ""grandma's book collection"" in the book sale. People always seem surprised when we don't put every book dug out of your family's dingy basement on our shelves and instead flip them for a profit to buy nice, new books that don't smell like mold and rat droppings. If your granny's book collection means that much to you and you don't like the idea of some greasy strangers flipping through her Victorian porno stash, keep them. 

And the guy who insisted that a teen book was pornographic (it wasn't) and trashed it. Then was charged for it and was super proud of the fact claiming he ""did what he had to do and will pay the price"". I didn't really argue with him, another just ""smile and nod"". He paid it though and I'm pretty sure the librarian bought two copies of the book afterwards. | I work in IT for a 11 figure corporation.

The plumbers who installed the new septic tank even told her to her face it was because of the baby wipes but she just ignorantly doesn't believe them or me. | I stayed with a complete idiot in the UK in 2018 who thought:

I had a patient do an exercise and said do the leg lift 2x15 for each leg. She started doing them back and forth but counting them like left leg one, right leg two.

I have the right to make my own decisions. | That changing the font size wasn't going to affect the word count. | One time I was talking to my mom and sister about how I'd like to just flat out remove my uterus if given the option.

My dad came in equating removing an organ to killing a puppy. 

He genuinely kept trying to argue with us that it's the same thing. I'm *still* baffled several years later at how he came to the conclusion that an organ and a living, sentient being are the exact same. | The reason I can‚Äôt give them their prescriptions. | DONT PUT YOUR BARE HANDS IN THE TOILET AND PULL OUT HANDFULS OF SHIT. With a 78 yr old woman ü§£ | I started this one and still cringe to this day.  

Don‚Äôt remember how we even got on the topic but somehow we argued over what harassment is and my argument was non-physical since battery is more physical.  

It got so bad he transferred to a sister location down the street.  I don‚Äôt blame him.   Wish I could transfer out of my mind sometimes. | My mom swore up and down that one foot is 6 inches | Worked advanced support for landline faults for a telco here in Oz, I had a 45m discussion with a client that not unplugging all their gear (cordless phone, fax machine, modem yada yada yada) and leaving ONLY the bog standard unpowered corded landline phone in won‚Äôt give me a fault indication on the test.

Finally got them to do it, copious notes in the fault file to boot. Test comes back clean, no faults to the first point in the premises. I then call them on their mobile (cell) and get them to plug one piece of gear in at a time and testing for dial tone, sure enough it was the cordless phone, soon as they picked up the normal one, dead line.

The cordless was over 5 years old from memory. | That the Napali people at our work were not secretly Mexican. | I dated this guy in high school who just got a credit card and was bragging about it to everyone. He was explaining me that you can buy whatever you want and can pay it off a year later... we argued over it for a few days until he asked his mom. So stupid. | that noise pollution isn't an environmental hazard | My wife and I went to a popular breakfast spot and checked in. They took our phone number and we went to go wait in my wife‚Äôs new Infinity QX60. Now mind you, we both grew up poor and have worked hard at our careers to finally afford nice things. Her windows were freshly tinted and we were sitting there talking with the car off. A young lady with small children was getting in the car next to us and kept bumping her car door against our driver side rear door and she would say ‚Äúsorry car‚Äù every time she did it. After the fourth time I looked at my wife and said if you don‚Äôt say something I will. I was on the passenger side so I opened the door and stood up and asked her nicely (even though I was fuming inside) to try not to hit our car with her door. She looked up and I could tell she was sorry and before she could say anything I noticed a man and woman standing by the back of her car. The man says ‚Äúshe‚Äôs a single mom and she‚Äôs trying the best she can!!!‚Äù I said that‚Äôs great but she should respect other peoples property. I got back in the car because she was finished loading her kids and she apologized once again and I said don‚Äôt worry about just try to be more careful in the future. I watched as she went to hug the older couple, who I am assuming is her parents. They walk away and she pulls out and drives off. We got the text from the restaurant that our table was ready so we got out and started walking towards the restaurant. A Tesla pulls up and the older couple was in it. The lady rolls down the window and starts screaming at the top of her lungs at me about how I should watch my manners. The man gets out and starts talk crazy too. Once again, not wanting to argue with idiots I said I disagree and kept walking. She screamed at me that I was a bully and that I shouldn‚Äôt be mean to young women. I turned around and said ‚Äúif that young lady was your daughter or friend, why the fuck didn‚Äôt you help her load her kids and the stroller in the car? Instead, you both stood there and watched her struggle as she banged her car door into ours. How would you like it if I hit your car door?‚Äù They both looked stunned, and finally the guy says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a douche!‚Äù gets in his car and speeds off.  I still couldn‚Äôt figure out how I became the bad guy in this situation and the more I thought about him calling me a douche pissed me off so much I couldn‚Äôt even enjoy my breakfast. | When they claim undocumented immigrants vote.

This guys vehicle emblem came off in the wash. Said he doesn‚Äôt plan on getting scammed and is gonna get that $35 out of us. I went through all the footage and gathered it for him to show this has been half hanging off his car for 3 weeks now and eventually going through every other day it loosened enough to fall off. I had footage of this broken three weeks back. I stood next to him and showed him everything. The photos were on my phone and he goes. You‚Äôve edited those, I dry my car off I would know if it was broke. At this point I was over it and said obviously you didn‚Äôt my guy. He says I‚Äôm not arguing with you, just wait for my attorneys calls. Bruh over $35 f-ing dollars. And it‚Äôs not like this guy didn‚Äôt have money. Blows my mind. | That heart disease was a general term and not a specific condition | Gum does not stay in your stomach for seven years if you swallow it.

This man is in his 30‚Äôs | A room at work was hot; people plugged in a portable air conditioner.  I'm assuming it was supposed to have an exhaust hose, but it didn't.  It was just pumping cold air from one hole and hot air from another hole.  They didn't believe me when I said it was making the room hotter. | We lived in an apartment complex where the leasing office took over the first and part of the second floor of the apartment building. (1/4 of the second floor was the leasing office, the other 3/4 were actual rooms.) So when you took this giant circular staircase that walked around the entire office you went from the first floor all the way up to the third floor.¬†


The office also had stairs to the side of the leasing office that moved up in a zigzag pattern. But if you took these stairs, you had the option to also exit into the second floor so that you could go to the actual apartment rooms.¬†


The argument that was: It was smarter to take the leasing office stairs the wind around in a giant loop because they skipped the second floor and you would be able to make it to the 9th floor faster.¬†


I could not get them to understand that the second floor was still there, we were just bypassing it, but it was actually longer because we had to go around in a massive loop instead of just taking one zigzag to go through it.


The argument was so bad that we actually measured it with a step counter. We were able to confirm that the leasing office was in fact 45 steps longer, but then the argument turned into the fact that we were not accounting for vertical space and instead we're accounting for horizontal steps only.¬†


Dude... It's the same fucking height.¬† | I never could get my mother to understand how time zones affect flight schedules. She lived in Connecticut, I lived in Michigan, and the first she flew out to visit me, she had to connect through Chicago. Not a bad direction to fly in when you need extra time, but she was visibly irritated that while it was the same time in Connecticut and Michigan, it was an hour earlier in Illinois. 

After that, when I made flight reservations for her, I made sure she connected through Pittsburgh. | I heard a story once about a lady calling into a radio show to express frustration that the government needs to move the deer crossing sign to a different place because the stretch of road she drives on has too many deer crossing. | If I offer to buy you food and you want a small pizza, I notice for $5 more I can get a large...

Do you think there are 52 states in the USA?‚Äù. I told her there were 50 states, and she told me that Hawaii and Alaska were 51 and 52. I was so confused and told her that they were the 49th and 50th states. She told me I was wrong. I left wondering if she was just messing with me, but I‚Äôm pretty sure she still believes there are 52 States. | Witnessed an Argument between my Stepdad and my sister about parenting in which he said  (screamed at) her, ‚ÄúI know know more about being a mom than you‚Äù he doesn‚Äôt even have any bio kids | I could name so many I've had with my mum. She believed she met a man that was from space, she said he was something called a white and he wanted to tell her the truth about the government's relationship with aliens... she then said the aliens won't talk to her anymore because she told other people about them. Then about a year after that she was telling us that space isn't real and we are all stupid for believing what we are told. I've never been more frustrated trying to explain something to someone more in my life. It made it worse because she just shouts when you try and reason with her but you HAVE to sit and listen to her reasonings. I don't know how me and my siblings are alive tbh haha | Had to tell my husband how ignorant he sounded when he said all Jewish people have big noses and are good with money...

Yes, this person was constantly tired during the work week from doing this. | I just stopped my wife from lighting a pile of blankets and pillows (and subsequently our house) on fire to spite my daughter for not picking them up.

My teacher informed my friend and I that we were not allowed to play Pokemon. I was genuinely confused, so I asked ""why?"". She proceeded to tell me that Pokemon was an ""abomination unto God"" since they had magic powers and such. My answer was, ""You know Pokemon are not real, right?"". The look on her face was priceless. 

She held her ground for a bit on not letting us playing on the trip but eventually relented after seeing the game play with a warning not to bring it back to school again. 

I truly did not understand as a child how a grown ass woman would have some type of religious fear over Pokemon. I grew up in church but never seem to see that side of religion. Looking back, its actually kinda frightening that someone is so deluded that they had to have a kids logic to knock them back into reality. | My coked out former roommate took my clothes out of the washing machine (mid-wash) because he felt his laundry was more important.

One main road kind of town. 

We were selling off all our old VHS tapes because DVDs had became the mainstream. They were marked as 50% off. 

Well, to get them to sell and get rid of them faster, the owner put up a sign that they wet now an extra 50% off the sale price. 

I could not get through to a woman that 50% off the previous sale price did not make it 100% off and thus, free. After being unable to verbally convey to her that it‚Äôs just an extra 50% off the price, I showed her with visuals. I took a piece of paper and tore it in half. Then I took one half and tore that in half. 

She never understood. Said we were stupid for having that sign if they weren‚Äôt free and left angry. | That things are true or not independent of a person's opinion or current beliefs.

There really are people who attach truth to who says it. 

""So why should I believe you or that person?""
""You don't have to. You can look it up for yourself.""
""What if they are lying?""

She was crying and highly emotional when she called me before this, so I was going to visit her for support and comfort. I stayed home after her explosive tantrum. I was already past the point of caring for this relationship.

The things she's said to me and others, you wouldn't say to a dog. I lost count of how many times I had broken up with her, but that was the final nail, as I wasn't wearing rose-colored glasses anymore.

A deep hatred had been stewing inside me. A weight that seemingly encumbered my soul. I knew that there would never be an armistice with her. Each time she hoovered her way in, I took her back with love and hope. Unbeknownst to me, her respect for me faltered each time. Each time, a more distorted and unhinged version of her unveiled. She became unrecognizable. Her actions? Irreconcilable.

I finally had enough. Some say that love is the opposite of hate. I disagree. It is indifference, which is the absence of love and hate. | My grandma and I have argued so many times about fish being meat. She argued that ""cows and pigs and such are meat"" and that ""fish is fish"".

I argued back that she could be having the worst day of her life,And telling her to smile isn‚Äôt helping her mood right then and now.Also that it‚Äôs offensive to tell someone to smile when they don‚Äôt want to. | My wife eats spicy food in excess and has explosive diarrhea constantly.  When she does, she leaves shit splatters all over the bottom of the toilet seat in the bathroom outside the office.  She insists it's not her.  She also never replaces the toilet paper roll and blames it on me.  Here's the issue with this.  I have a bidet in my master bathroom and I haven't used the toilet outside her office for anything other than to pee in over 3 years.

I can't believe I constantly have to explain this to an adult only to have said adult accuse me of lying. | On a cruise ship stop in Puerto Rico, my friends American girlfriend got super mad at me when I couldn‚Äôt tell her if her phone plan covered her. It covered her when she visited me in Cabo San Lucas, so I should know. I explained to her that Puerto Rico was a US territory and not part of Mexico. When she continue to push me for a better answer, I told her I didn‚Äôt work for AT&T so maybe she should call them and ask them? When she started to scream I asked her if she even knew what country she was currently sitting in?

I told him i didn‚Äôt just take a shit did i? Then walked out to keep working. He came around the corner of the display i was building and he saw me and said it again! I blew my lid and started cussing this guy out, and during that he said he doesn‚Äôt get ‚Äúpoopy‚Äù on his hands when he wipes and asked if i did? Told him it was common fucking courtesy, especially at a fucking grocery store.

We were discussing a person we met at dinner last night and I mentioned that he did ecstatic dance.

I told her to scroll down,  and there's the verb ""broom"".

Then she had a bad attitude and never spoke to me again after saying ""Well nobody uses it that way"".

He goes on and on about how ""they"" claim covid is killing everyone and pharmaceutical companies are fooling everyone and ""they"" engineered a disease, and ""they"" said to wear masks that don't do anything, blah blah blah standard stuff. Eventually, we got to a point where I was telling him about how the CDC does something or other, and he asks me why I thought the CDC had anything to do with the conversation. I asked him what he thought the CDC was. He said they were ""just those guys in the yellow suits with masks and shit.""

On a road trip with multiple cars and for some reason this girl thought she should be the lead car, despite me and the other driver being professional truckers. Ok no problem, going to the same place so whatever. 

She proceeded to drive in the left lane doing a couple mph under the speed limit. Followed her for a bit but we couldn‚Äôt take all the pissed off people cutting around is, honking and flipping the bird. This was a super rural 2 lane highway. Right lane wide open, and still she sat in the fast lane doing 62 in a 65 while everyone passing us was doing 70+.

I eventually called the passenger of that car and asked what they were doing going under the speed limit in the fast lane. Driver proceeded to start bitching at me over the passengers phone that I don‚Äôt know everything and there was nothing illegal about what she was doing. And while obviously not illegal, definitely what I consider a dick move. Told her the left lane was for passing and if your being passed by the right lane get the fuck out of the left. 

Despite multiple people getting pissed at her she still didn‚Äôt think it was a bad idea. After about a hour we both passed her in the right lane doing 5mph over the speed limit but keeping up either way the flow of traffic. When they eventually got to the cabin we were driving towards, she was pissed off at us for ‚Äúspeeding‚Äù and breaking the law instead of riding behind her.

And my first driving job, they had a supervisor that would go over fuel mileage with each team. The problem was that me and the other driver didn't start our trip with a full tank.

This guy got into an argument with me about how I wasn't ""creating"" anything in the ticket and so I should change the title of the ticket.  I argued at first because it seemed like he just misunderstood what it was about, but as it went on and on, he was being really insistent about the definition of ""create"" and explaining how the ticket wasn't about ""creating"" anything.  I had to take a second to wonder what the heck is even the point of his argument?

ME: ::dials 911:: | 12 year old is in a group text with 6 other girls.

All PG all sweet and it shocks me everything I read it. Not was 12 year old me would be saying (I'm dad)


One girl though is not as nice. She's the one the other girls try to keep calm and stuff. Well, sadly, this girls dad passes away. About 6 weeks ago. She tells the group and everyone including my kid is sending incredibly well thought out messages of hope. Words that almost brought me to tears. Amazing level of emotion for 12 year olds.


The next day, chat starts up and my kid is talking to some of the girls and makes a joke. A random, to do with nothing happy joke. Girl with a dead dad flips out demanding she apologize for being happy the day after the news. 


My daughter is distraught, she thinks she made some massive social fuck up and was an asshole. I explain her friend is going through insane emotions and to just say sorry and put the chat away for the day and give her some space. 



She apologizes. Other girl isn't having it. Digs deeper into my kid. Says fucked up shit like she hopes I die. (I'm dad).. Her other friends all step in and try to calm her down, again showing emotional maturity I didn't have until my 20s. 


Nothing works. This goes on for days. My kid finally leaves the group chat all together. I end up texting the girls mom a week later when she starts harassing my kid about it in school. Tell her I know she's going through stuff but she was picking my kid to take it out on. 


I can't explain how much of a non problem my kid was, how she was sweet and apologetic and worried for her friend. Other girls mom reads the group chat and calls me to yell at me for being a disrespectful loser and even gets another parent to call me out as well. 


All the while another week has passed and the school calls me because my daughter threatened to kill herself the bullying had gotten so bad this kid convinced other kids my daughter disrespected her dead dad. 


I finally had to print the chat out and send it to the school and drove the girls mom's house and screamed and threatened her with the cops if she didn't get control of her kid. 


I had to explain to this cunt that just because something awful happens to you doesn't mean the world suddenly revolves around you and gives you the right to be an asshole and lie about others. | Argued with my in laws when they lived with me about cleaning their room and not watching tv ALL day | I've got a few. An old roommate and ex-best friend of mine was convinced that getting an iud meant I'd have ""needles stabbed into"" my cervix. I explained that I had done research and that was not the case. She insisted until I showed her the tools involved and cited sources. She hated that I always had to ""be right"" and was always ""gaslighting"" her by Googling the crazy shit she said.


Our friendship ended when she agreed to go to a party with me and split the Uber fare because my car was in the shop and she didn't drive. Then she canceled the morning of when I was at work. When I was angry, she INSISTED that must mean the party was ""very important"" to me and I should've let her know that. No, it's just in really bad taste to back out of longstanding plans we had had for weeks at the last minute! But she would not believe me. Then it turned into her saying I was ""belittling her condition"" because she decided she had POTS... but she had never been to a doctor... and had never told me any of her symptoms she was using as an excuse until that moment, which she didn't bring up when she originally backed out... and which she probably should've known about when she first agreed to go...

I worked in a building that was next to a river that was the border between us and the state to the north. A coworker offhandedly talked about ""heading north"" out to a suburb to the east of the city. 

I don't remember the details, but I remember pulling up Google maps and showing her the map, but she was convinced the way we were facing (to the east) was north and couldn't be convinced any other way. 

She finally downloaded a compass app, opened it, and then acted liked we hadn't even had the conversation.

Keep in mind, this was a legitimate profile, and he did not give me the impression he was joking-he was being dead serious, and even said my views were ""outdated"".

  
I was telling him that women tend to have wider hips, and bigger butts than men do. Conversely, I was also arguing that men tend to have more narrow hips, smaller butts, and wider shoulders. That's when he went off on me, and told me I was relying on ""outdated stereotypes"". | That the US government has ever done anything that was actually more beneficial than not. | argued with a nurse that cold stress was real | Not exactly argument but I once had a guy come up to me on the sidewalk, trying to intimidate me.

These were high school sophomores.

Was in a logic class and we were watching some of Hitler's speeches since my teacher said he was a good example of being able to sway people's perceptions with words. At some point during the speech, a group of kids just started giggling and when the teacher paused the video to ask them what for, they just imitated Hitler's talking and then asked how anybody could understand what he was saying. Teacher replies with a confused tone that its because he was speaking in German (subtitles were provided throughout the entire video mind you) and they all just sat and stared. Few seconds later one of them just mumbles that they didn't think about it that way and then they shut up for the rest of the period. | A girl I worked with was CONVINCED there was a new speed trap going after ""slow pokes,"" those that are going just a few under the limit.

My colleague has a tendency to attract people who are convinced that they have parasites in their eyes (we work in eye care btw). We‚Äôre talking about people with relatively healthy eyes or they have a completely different and yet common condition like cataracts. They do their ‚Äúresearch‚Äù on Google and feel as if they somehow contracted a parasite in their eye. It is INCREDIBLY RARE for that to happen. In all my 10 years of practice I have still yet to see anything like that. I work in a highly medical based office and prior to that I worked at an academic institution. Still incredibly rare. There‚Äôs no convincing these types of people that they don‚Äôt have some sort of worm or whatever in the eye. You could be blue in the face and it‚Äôll do you no good. You could send to all the specialists in the world and it‚Äôd still do no good. There are many other silly conversations/debates that are had but this one in particular comes to mind. | Women can get AIDS | I was a young teenage girl. The public craziness of Chris Brown and Rihanna was going on of when he brutally assaulted her.

I had to argue to this old ass grown ass ‚Äúman‚Äù that singing about a type of consensual sex is different than being PHYSICALLY ABUSED. He was a sicko. | Difference between marginal tax rate and effective tax rate. I had a friend who was convinced that an increase in income that pushed you into a higher tax bracket was a net bad thing because you‚Äôd be taxed on all of your income at 32%, for example, instead of 24%. It was a frustrating 10 minute argument, with multiple examples given. | I went like ten rounds with this old lady cashier as I was counting her register.  I counted how many of each denomination of bills there were and then multiplied them by their value.  I explained over and over and trying to demonstrate it as simply as possible that when I count there are three 5's I just do 3x5 and there are $15 there. ""But you are counting by ones and those are fives"" ""yes but there are 3 fives in my hand so I know it is $15""  I never got through.

She asked how I knew and I answered ""a pint a pound the world around"" but she was dumbfounded by my answer and I tried to clarify that a pint of water weighs a pound and there are 8 pints to a gallon so 2 gallons of water weighs 16 lbs.  Milk has some dissolved solids that make it denser but also fats that are less dense than water so I'm guessing milk is pretty close to the density of water.  Now the cashier's eyes were glazed over so I knew I lost her.  Then it occurred to me that she might be more familiar with the metric system so I asked if she understood that a liter of water weighs about a kilogram? But by this time she just wanted me to pay and leave. | Every time I visit my sister I have a weird conversation with my bro in law

So when she wore tampons she extracted them, peed and put them back inside. I had to explain to her that no, there are two holes so you can pee with a tampon inside and only the little rope can absorb piss, and no, a 50ml cup is too small to hold an average piss, so i wasn't walking around with a cup full of piss in my private parts.

The funny part was that we were having dinner with friends of friends we barely knew, and they were shocked we talked about periods, piss, poo, toilets and foot fungal infections in front of men and in public. | A co worker thinks you can learn anything from YouTube and you don‚Äôt need to go to college.

I had to type up an incident report because a patient slipped and fell in the parking lot. I used ""they"" as the pronoun because I was unsure of their pronouns. He went on to explain to me that ""they"" is plural and not to use that for one person.

It is one of those situations where someone who is by all means a very intelligent person says something and you are just floored by the ""logic "" in their mind.

With a stick shift, if you‚Äôre on an incline you can ‚Äúhill hold‚Äù where you give some input to the clutch and throttle to keep the vehicle stationary. This means, your brake lights aren‚Äôt activated. Which is why the cop pulled me over.

He had me tap my brakes, then questioned the validity of my safety inspection, because ‚Äúmy tail lights seem to be intermittent.‚Äù

I explained that the vehicle was a stick shift which to him ‚Äúmeant absolute nothing.‚Äù

So I‚Äôm arguing with this cop on how manual transmissions operate and he‚Äôs not buying it.

According to him, we only use ships because we don't yet know how to build bridges that span oceans.  And we only use trains because liberals love transportation that locks you into a preset course and destination.

He had absolute, positive, indisputable *proof* of this.

You know what it was?  


""Trucks pay road taxes.  Ships and trains don't!""

It kept declining and I asked if she knew the balance knowing the transaction was likely higher than what was available.

On the same night, his wife told me that white Christians are the most persecuted demographic in America. | I have had to *regularly* argue how percentages work to adults.

I work in HR but in roles that include working with a lot of data. Things like monthly reports of the percentage of women in each department, with a rolling 12 month average. For context it‚Äôs a male dominated industry and we have a lot of goals to improve women‚Äôs experience and participation.  On more occasions than I can name I‚Äôve had to explain that a rolling 12 month average is not the average of the percentages from the previous 12 months. 

I‚Äôve also had to explain how the percentage of women in the business is not ‚Äú women / men x 100‚Äù, but ‚Äú(women / women + [men and other])x 100. The worst part is it‚Äôs all delivered with a ‚Äògotcha!‚Äô attitude. Like, uhm, actually! Having to explain how percentages and averages work to professionals who are WAY beyond my pay grade is an absolute minefield. 

One table in particular which is required externally for annual reporting broke me. The rows are roles within the company increasing in senior (frontline employees, supervisors, managers & senior managers) and the columns are the global location. There is a total column on both the rows and columns. The data in each cell is the average proportion of women‚Äôs wages compared to the average men‚Äôs salary. The table needs to be expressed with only 1 decimal place. So, if a location has perfect gender equality, the figure is 1. If women make more than men, it‚Äôs a number over 1, if men make more than women, it‚Äôs a figure below 1. Naturally, most employers are in the first row of frontline employees, with the total number decreasing in each category as they become more and more senior.   

Oh, My. God. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt the columns add up?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow can almost all groups be equal but the total doesn‚Äôt reflect that?‚Äù   

I have literally felt the words ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to explain to you how numbers work‚Äô escape my sleep deprived lips when talking to my VP.   

If this is unclear for anyone, you can‚Äôt average monthly averages to get an annual average. You need to add all the numerators (top numbers) together and all the denominators (bottom number) together, *then* divide the total numerators by the numerator *plus *the denominator.

For example 
[100x (Total women)/(total women + total men/other)] = overall percentage of women

For the pay equity example, it‚Äôs just a factor of the size of the groups. So if there‚Äôs a C suite of 5 and the CEO is male, of course the pay equity reads poorly. That‚Äôs just quick maffs. Using a supply department as an example, if most of your warehouse employees (n = 300) are men, but marketing management roles (n = 20), are dominated by women, the total >1 pay equity score in marketing doesn‚Äôt just doesn‚Äôt ‚Äôbalance out‚Äô the <0.9 in warehousing.

The really stupid shit is that I‚Äôm terrible with numbers. I don‚Äôt find it easy at all to explain these things to people and I always end up second guessing myself. So when they argue with me, it takes a lot of effort for me to defend my figures. It truly makes me feel like I‚Äôm going to implode. | My Mom refuses to believe that the Earth revolves around the sun.

My stepdad was one of those ""masks are for sissies"" thinkers and I had to explain to him numerous times, borderline with crayons and paper, WHY masks do in fact keep us safer, and WHY you're not a sissy baby demo-rat snowflake if you protect yourself against a potentially deadly virus. | Just because our generation suffered socioeconomic and political bullshit doesn‚Äôt mean the next one does‚Ä¶. | I had a LONG argument with my older sister about how the moon isn‚Äôt actually made of green cheese (and her SAT score was significantly higher than mine!)! | A guy once told me that manual transmissions are faster than auto transmissions...

So, he tried to fight me.  ü§£üçª | I‚Äôm honestly really excited for the day I meet a bonafide flat earther who likes to argue. | Ex spec ops soldier(actual Ranger), fervent GOP and Trump supporter. Disagreed with everything Trump stands for, has done, but will never vote for anyone but the GOP ticket. 

Because Democrats are destroying the country. 

This man is a friend, and the reason I understand that intelligence means nothing: he has a masters in politics and communication, and worked with the tinfoil hat guys at Raytheon. Skunkworks. 

We don't talk politics. I'd have his back in a pinch, and he's proven to have mine. I don't like his politics, but that's not all of the guy. Mind-blowing conversation that was, though. | No, your chainsaw does not make 70 horsepower.....

Not all the stuff, but when a former coworker of mine started talking about fine gold jewelry and that some of his got tarnished because of the IRON in it!?! Of course I overheard him and immediately explained that iron isn‚Äôt one of the alloys used in karat gold, but shared which alloys were used. He was pissed!

Just being curious how it worked. He said no, it powers a solenoid to move the latch using an electric current. Not knowing I asked ""Is a solenoid just an electro magnet?"". He said ""No, an eletromagnetic door requires a continuous current.""

That went back and forth for a few minutes, each of us getting more frustrated. I knew enough physics to know he was wrong about something, but nothing about electrical engineering.

They were advertising deli style cold cut sandwiches.  
I went with the turkey. 
The turkey sandwich had thin layers of ice on the thinly sliced turkey meat.  
You already see where this is going.  
I complained to the waitress.
I tried to explain that that isn't what cold cut meant.  
I then overheard her talking to the ""chef"" about my complaint. 
I heard him remark, ""But it's cold cut.""
I blame management for not knowing what the fuck cold cut meant and then passing their erroneous information on to these dipshits.
Did people honestly think people were clamoring for ice on their cold cut deli sandwiches? 
I honestly left thinking I was crazy. | That 1 Trillion is a real number | When discussing covid with my fully healthy, mentally sound grandma, I had to explain that an arm‚Äôs length was not the same thing as 6ft.

I have a 8‚Äù dobsonian telescope so I invited them to have a look at some planets. When we were watching Saturn ü™ê, that guy had a look and just flipped on me.

He simply refused to believe that what he‚Äôs watching from his own eyes isn‚Äôt true and why should he believe what i am saying is true. Mind you the ring of planet saturn and several moons were clearly visible. | I once had a very concerned and curious young woman ask me about how we are able to harvest the wings we serve at our restaurant from the buffalo. Which are, ""Really big and dangerous right?"" And I shit you not, she was also wondering how they were able to get off the ground.

My former roommate is right about the stupidest motherfucker I have ever met in my life. Mind numbing dumb. I had to explain so many basic things to her. I had to show her how to properly use a vacuum. She would just turn it on, randomly push it around the room, and genuinely thought it was correct. I had to explain to her what expiration dates on food actually were, a fact that she threw out the moment I finished speaking. I had to explain that there was more to cleaning a bathroom than wiping down the counter. I actually had to clean her bathroom multiple times because she did it so poorly it made the rest of the house stink. I had to explain that yes you do have to clean the cat food dishes and fountain. I had to explain to her that tower pcs do not have batteries and have to be plugged in to function. I had to explain that using the dirty dish rag to clean the counters actually doesn‚Äôt do shit and makes it worse.

Our beef is kept in a dimly lit cooler so that way it doesn‚Äôt spoil. When it gets out on the shelf and touches light it becomes red. I had a lady claim that we sold her spoiled ground beef because it was dark in the middle and red on the outside. I explained this same thing to her, and she told me that I was wrong because she grew up on a chicken farm the darker the meat is the worse it is. I just stared at her and then eventually a customer behind her called her an idiot and said to go up front and complain and not waste my time. She left in a huff, and later my store manager came by and asked with a smile, ‚ÄúIs the ground beef dark?‚Äù | I was working childcare this summer and she threatened to beat up a child, in 2nd grade, because this kid was ‚Äúbullying her kid.‚Äù 3 adults had to step in between her and the child to get her to walk away.

So I got to go ask what the fuck that guy's problem was, kicked him out of the hotel while saying, ""In what fucking universe is that acceptable behavior, dude?"" to which the drunk dude said ""no universe :(""

Absolutely wild. | Girlfriend thought nature was smarter than mankind because trees always grow around power lines/telephone cables. She did not believe me when I told her people cut the tree branches so they don't touch the wires. We were 26.

He said breading kills salmonella. 15 minutes of my life I will never get back and randomly wondering if he ever got sick. | Tl;dr A friend who's supposedly good at cooking didn't believe me that the more food you put into the oven, the more time it would take for it to cook, because the more mass is in there, the more energy is needed to heat that mass.

It all started with me struggling to bake cookies in a way I wanted. I wanted them thicc but they always spread flat. So I was consulting with her and eventually came to the realization that I just need to put more cookies on the baking sheet so that there's more mass (in total) in the oven, which would make them spread less. It's a bit counterintuitive, because the reason I was using less cookies per baking sheet was so there's more space between them and they don't stick to each other. Anyway, I tried it and it actually worked. She still didn't believe me that was the reason they were spreading so much and said I have changed the temperature/time/recipe. 

Before I tried it, I even asked her the following. Let's say that the oven bakes a bread (500g) for 5 minutes at 200C, if you put 5 breads (5x500g) would they still bake for 5 minutes? Her answer was yes and I never managed to convince her it's not. 

I even googled ""does it take more time to bake more food"" and sent her the first search result which is ""Cooking multiple items at once means dishes will spend about 15 percent longer in the oven, but you'll need to keep a close eye on food to check for doneness and browning along the way."" And she's was like, but it's saying multiple dishes, we're talking about the same dish multiple times (as if that makes the difference) üòÇ

Btw I'm now using the bread question as an IQ test. So far most people pass it or understand why they got it wrong, but a few (not trying to be sexist) women either didn't pass it or weren't convinced in the truth. I'm yet to see a man not passing it, even if they aren't cooks, they understand the physics behind and give proper answer themselves. | That you can have non-veg every day but on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, otherwise someone somewhere high up in the sky would be very very mad | My fianc√© and his family thought that narwhals weren‚Äôt  real when I first met his family.

I think a lot of people don't grasp inflation or how everything is moving away from everything and accelerating too. 

When people say ""it's just a theory"" doesn't mean you chose if you want to believe it. Aerodynamics is a theory. Electromagnetism is a theory. It means its far and away the most educated working functional model.

People can't grasp evolution and genetics came along and dunked on all of them. 

And we most certainly have witnessed evolution in California salamanders and now the Bajau have developed a larger spleen which provides more blood and oxygen since their culture is based on the ocean and they hold their breath longer.

I was shocked when my best friend's boyfriend hit on me and then MY BF blamed ME for it. Unbelievable! I told her what had happened, hoping she would see him for what he truly is‚Äîa dishonest cheat. Instead, she blamed me, and sadly, our friendship ended. How could it possibly be my fault? If it had been someone else, she might never have found out, but I felt it was important to tell her the truth. Even though I sometimes wonder if staying silent would have spared our friendship, deep down, I know I did the right thing. | Had an ex tell me, loudly and in front of others, that there were no sharks in the ocean, only in the sea. 

I was dumbfounded for a moment, then laughed thinking he was joking. Once I realized he was *not* joking, the conversation just went to hell in a handbasket. I was stuck between being stupified, and laughing in between time, and he just sat there arguing with me, while furiously Googling in an attempt to prove me wrong (he did that a lot and it didn't often work lol). | A guy didnt believed that we are rotating around the sun | That there‚Äôs no wax on the windshield of airplanes to keep them free from rain because ‚Äúyou have no wipers‚Äù.

They could NOT understand i was still paying the right amount, getting the right change and just did not want coins. | Arguing with a grown adult about whether the sun is a star was something I never thought I'd have to do. | My phd sister in law saying she doesn‚Äôt like when people are blowing up rocks to build houses, because mountains are ‚Äùhundreds of years old‚Äù.

Told her to keep an eye on it so it doesn't get too big. She said ""Oh, wasps lay eggs?""

I paused. ""Don't all, or most insects lay eggs?"" She shrugged and said ""Well, not butterflies."" I paused. ""I'm pretty sure butterflies lay eggs?"" She said ""They have cocoons.""

I said ""Yeah, I think they lay their eggs on a plant or something, not in their cocoon."" She asked what the cocoon was for then. This was when I fleetingly wondered if she had lost her mind. I told her that butterflies become butterflies from the cocoon, and they lay eggs that become caterpillars. She just stared blankly back at me. I had a small mental crisis thinking maybe I'm the idiot who's been misunderstanding the butterfly life cycle, the thing many elementary schools teach... | Just this weekend i had an argument with an adult women who was furious i had the audacity to bump into her in the bumpercars at a theme park. For some reason she didn't quite understand that the entire purpose of going into the bumpercars was to.... well... bump each other with the bumpercars.

She just cursed at me in some foreign language and was angry because she just wanted to drive around for a bit and not be bumped into... Girl go visit a karting track or at least just ask me nicely not to bump into you again. Not like we can read your mind | How it gets darker earlier in the Winter than in the summer. | That 16 (weight) ounces =/= a pint of 16 (fl) ounces. 

Tbf, its a fucked up measuring system sure. But if you know that a container of a certain size is a pint, and depending on if that pint is filled with foam, or rocks, you know that pint would weigh different, HOW THE FUCK can you not get that a pint =/= a pound!? | If a toilet has become disgusting, it is better to give it a quick brushing with soap or toilet bowl cleaner & remove visible dirt than to just leave it and wait until you have time to thoroughly scrub with bleach, which could be weeks or longer. Ongoing argument where the other person is convinced that it is better to wait & live with the filth in the meantime, because removing the visible dirt without disinfecting it means it still isn‚Äôt really clean but now you‚Äôve lost the visual cue that indicates the need for a ‚Äúproper‚Äù cleaning. | My father recently told me that he is partially to thank for me having a good credit score. He said that when he opened a joint checking account with his name and my name on it back when I was a teen, that helped jump start my credit score. No, it didn‚Äôt. I started out with zero credit as an adult and built it from the ground up on my own. I still don‚Äôt think he believes me. | Had a debate with an adult Christian who swears that you can prove Christianity with logic and evidence.    

So I open and say ‚Äútheres no evidence backing up the fantastical claims of the Bible‚Äù.   

And he says ‚Äúbut 400 people saw Jesus after he was resurrected‚Äù.   

To which I said ‚Äúyes, that is the claim made in the Bible. Without evidence‚Äù.   

To which he said ‚Äúwell the apostles were all martyrs, that proves it‚Äôs true‚Äù.   

To which I said ‚Äúyes, that is another claim made in the Bible, without evidence‚Äù.   

We did that whole roundabout on several different claims, and this guy who‚Äôs supposedly so into being able to prove Christianity with evidence still had not grasped the basic premise that a claim does not equal evidence | That stepping on a flat metal TACK is not emergency and you won‚Äôt die, get blood poisoning or need to go to the ER. True story. People are nuts. | That even if you‚Äôre driving 60mph, if your car has turbo you can drive 60 miles in less than an hour. Going 60mph. Emphasis. | Honestly, I‚Äôm pretty dumb.

You'd be shocked how much you have to tell grown adults to wash their hands | I had to debate with a family member about why it's important to return borrowed items in a timely manner. It seemed like such a basic concept, yet we were going back and forth about it. | Worked with a guy who had blind confidence he could fight rona rousey because she was a woman and aint no way a woman could beat him up | I mentioned I am originally from Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. This person said Pittsburgh isn‚Äôt in Pennsylvania and it is its own state. They refused to believe it was in Pennsylvania. I used the example ‚ÄúYou know how Raleigh is a city in North Carolina? It‚Äôs the same thing, but Pittsburgh is a city in Pennsylvania‚Äù and they insisted that wasn‚Äôt true, despite agreeing that Raleigh is a city in North Carolina. 

There were also 2 other people trying to explain that to them, but they kept arguing about it, so we eventually let it go. | I had an argument with a guy here on Reddit who was complaining about Venezuelans coming to the US and filing asylum claims. ‚ÄúThey should come here the right way, like I did. Took 30+ years, but I‚Äôm finally getting my green card.‚Äù

The guy had been brought to the US as a child, illegally, and lived his entire life in the country undocumented. He had fully skirted immigration law, and was complaining about people who had LEGALLY requested asylum when entering the country. Dude could not grasp that the Venezuelans were following the actual law, and his parents had not. And at best he could file for permanent residency, while asylum claims have the potential to grant full citizenship.

First time I ever saw someone say ‚Äúwell I got mine‚Äù when they had not, in fact, gotten theirs. | That using popularity to justify and defend his argument was nonsensical, illogical, and immature. | Teacher was adamant climate change wasn't real.

When I first heard him saying that I was so shocked that we almost had a car accident. | Dude claimed the CIA ""did an experiment"" that ""proves"" that astral projection is real. I tried to explain why there was absolutely no way that's remotely true, but he got absolutely blue in the face about it, said ""you haven't read the paper so you don't know shit"" and sent me a link. I spent 3 hours ripping it to shreds in detail, outlining almost a hundred ways the paper was 1) wrong 2) unscientific 3) written by just some guy who wasn't even a scientist 4) relied on literal magic at times, 
 before I paused to ask him how this could ever have been convincing to him. To which he admitted that he'd never opened it. | Grown up adult, well educated, overall nice guy.

He INSISTED that a single drop of oil can contaminate hunders of liters of water....

Olive oil. Not motor oil. 

When I asked him how he cleans his dishes then he got really angry. 

It was quite a bizarre discussion. | I worked with a 35 year old man who had no idea what a pope was. He was, however, very into Disney collectibles.

We were computer fucking science professors. I hated that guy. | that dating a freshly 17 year old at 21, almost 22, was gross and borderline pedophilic, but definitely an uneven power dynamic‚Ä¶ | That defrauding people is illegal and immoral. | This year, I met a Flat Earther.

Another guy I've met is convinced that the Jews were the cause/started World War II. | I have to occasionally yell at my parents to get off their phones and pay attention to my daughter, play with her, give her water or change her after she pees. 

Growing up they would yell at me for playing too much games but now they are the ones glued to their phones and I have to yell at them. Normally I wouldn't care but not when it comes to my daughter. 

I am busy with studies and work. I make time when I can or if it's urgent. Nothing they do on their phones are more important than their granddaughter but I seem to have to remind them that occasionally | Had an argument with a conservative about how the Georgia shooters dad is being charged. 

For reference, the kid had posted about doing a school shooting before and it was ‚Äònot a joke‚Äô enough for the FBI to question him. His dad later gave him a gun that he eventually used to kill 2 teachers and 2 students. 

Whether or not you think he‚Äôs guilty of that kind of neglect is a debate in itself (and there may be more we don‚Äôt know since this is still so recent).

But the dudes argument was ‚Äúwell, the kid did the shooting, not the parent, so the parent isn‚Äôt liable at all.‚Äù It was incredibly stupid, they argued the gun owner should have absolutely 0 responsibility/accountability if someone takes their gun and uses it to commit a shooting in any situation. 

Obviously it depends on the specific circumstances in which this would apply, they argued it should never apply, and that any attempt at enforcing this is a major government overreach. 

I just couldn‚Äôt believe that there was someone out there who fully believed you should be able to buy a tool designed for killing, and have absolutely no responsibility for handling/storing it so those who shouldn‚Äôt be handling it aren‚Äôt. | That you couldn‚Äôt blend cheese to make milk | I had to argue with a grown man in his 60's, a grumpy old bastard that taught one of my classes that women can not, in fact, control their periods. We don't control when they start, stop, or the flow. I added it wasn't like a faucet we turned off and on when convenient. This happened mid-semester, during class. I was just trying to slip out for 5 damn minutes to the bathroom because mine had started during class. That man tried his hardest to get me to back down, but he chose the wrong woman on a shit day. 

I complained, and he missed some classes for staff re-education. | I had two friends who were a couple. I actually got them to date each other. I was better friends with her than with him. She confided in me that she was going to break up with him but didn‚Äôt want to but had to cause he didn‚Äôt wipe his ass. They actually argued about it and he refused to start.

I had to talk to him for her to see if I could save the relationship and I got into the same argument with him that she got into. It was like I was arguing with a four year old. I was listing all the virtues and benefits of having a clean asshole. It was fucking ridiculous. 

She broke up with him the day after. | Any pemdas argument | The age of consent to a 53 year old man... | I am half German, half Finnish and used to travel to Finland in the summer.

He said something to me about getting off my phone and I told him nah I‚Äôm gonna go to the office. Told them the situation and they were on my side | When I tested for my driver's license, I asked the examiner if there was a speed he preferred I drove at. He said, ""the speed limit is the minimum."" I responded, ""you mean maximum?"" He goes, ""no, minimum.""

Stop freaking out our 6 yr old. | That shitting in diapers for ""dear leader"" is not normal behavior. | Adult BIL (father of 3) vehemently argued with me that women have prostates.  Refused to listen to me even though I have a degree in biology (pre-med). | This man told me he ‚Äòdidn‚Äôt believe in suicide‚Äô‚Ä¶ he wouldn‚Äôt elaborate on the statement, he just ‚Äòdidn‚Äôt believe in it‚Äô. I not so calmly explained that it wasn‚Äôt the fucking tooth fairy, it‚Äôs a real thing that real people choose to do everyday. That it is in no way a choice that is made lightly, and it‚Äôs heartbreaking that people can get to the point where they feel that is their only option. But it‚Äôs fucking real, and to minimize it or not take it seriously is incredibly disrespectful to everyone who has dealt with suicide in any way. 

It still makes me angry thinking about it | ‚ÄúYou were going over 100mph!‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúUmm no I was certainly not..‚Äù
‚ÄúI was going 110mph to catch up to you for the last 1.5miles!!‚Äù

One girl, I'd say she was in her late 20s and I was 19, thought the earth was at the center of our solar system. The same girl also didn't believe me when I told her kangaroos absolutely do not lay eggs- she was fascinated when I showed her the teeny tiny grain of rice sized babies.

Another woman at work who was also quite a bit older than me was astounded to learn that her peehole and vagina were two separate holes.

Seemed to get mad the more I tried to explain what it was, and then just said ""Nevermind!"" and left | Earlier this year, I was managing a team of little league baseball (with my 10 y.o. on the team). I had just been out to the plate to confirm with the umpire and the other team's manager that we'd start another inning (or at least try to, depending on light). One of the other father-coaches of my team was upset we were going to start another inning because of the time he had to work the next day. 

I'll add that playing the additional inning didn't put us at risk of losing the game. Also, by rule, we should have been playing the additional inning as it is based on the time the final out of the just-completed inning was made. The only question was how long we'd have light--some fields have lights but this one didn't. We ended up only playing part of the inning as the light got too dim to complete it. 

I imagine that night and the next day he cursed those few extra minutes that the ~18 kids got to play a few more batters while he was ready to go home. | In my grandmother funeral he asked who am I related with grandmother and I literally failed to make him understand I'm her grandson.

I can‚Äôt believe parents would do that to their kid, but hey I feel better now that they‚Äôre out of the picture. | Before apple updated phones to allow you to exit the phone call screen without ending the call itself, my parents told me to ""make the screen go away"" one time.

They were furious, and insisted that I had exited the screen without ending the call before (which literally wasn't a thing yet). | I had to ELI5 hard that, let's say, tuesday, the 10th isn't ""once in a 20 something thousand years"". My friend read that in one of those ""pass on"" messages on facebook.  
The actual gregorian calendar goes ""full circle"" every 28 years and october 10th will be tuesday then. (As identical as the rest of the year). The formula is simple enough. There are 7 days in a week and every fourth year february has one more day. 7x4=28. | 1*1=1 and not 2

because if you have one box with one cat, then you will count that there's 1 cat in total, or (1 box) * (1 cat/box) = 1 cat

They got hung up on the units (""you can't multiply a cat by a box""), and I had to explain that the second number isn't in units of boxes, it's a conversion factor. And you absolutely can multiply a cat by a box, you just get units of cat*boxes and maybe that's useful to someone. | Whether you use lemon or milk in Earl Grey tea | That washing your hands after using the bathroom was important. | That when the promotion period is over, you can't get the product for the discounted price.

No, you cannot check in right now. Its 5am and check-in is at 4pm. No you cannot stand in the middle of the lobby for 11 hours until you are ready.


Ma'am you made a reservation for July 8th, it is July 7th, and we are full. I don't care if you have a reservation because it's not for today and there are no rooms.


Yes ma'am I'm aware that Priceline sold you a room at this hotel. However Priceline never sent me the information on that reservation so I have no rooms available. No it is not my fault, Priceline is the one who took your money, I cannot give you a refund for something I never got money for.


Hotels are wild with this shit. | Someone tried to tell me that ""people are responsible for their own triggers."" 

The context is that someone posted highly sensitive and triggering content in a Facebook group, and I simply said, ""I wish there were trigger warnings."" Their response was, ""then stop reading."" I tried to explain that this isn‚Äôt how triggers work, I can‚Äôt know the content is triggering until I've already seen it.

Washing your baby with a pink bottle of baby shampoo, which was the color of all the brands we had in stock, will in fact not harm your baby boy.

Their argument was, ""It's in space. Therefore, it's a planet.""

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs that cheating???‚Äù

It was like the Patrick/wallet conversation from SpongeBob SquarePants.

She has never been out of the US and was absolutely indignant when I explained that in Ireland, we don‚Äôt use the American system. However, I made a drastic error in also pointing out that dates work differently elsewhere and that the American practice was not universal. 09/08/2024 vs 08/09/2024  being 9th of August vs, August 9th.

At that point she was convinced I was joking and/or making fun of her. | Had an argument with an older couple when i worked in a shop and couple of years ago, that we weren't infact scamming them with 'hidden fees' *because our receipts were laid out in a way that showed the VAT breakdown, very normal in the UK* 

They were a british couple, well to do, probably in their 60s. I had to explain to them what VAT was and that yes, you pay it on all goods and services. They were so rude and adamant we were doing something dodgy that i ended up having to take out a calculator and show them manually, that everything on the receipt + the VAT added up to what they were expecting to pay, and it wasn't an extra but included in the price. | Bartender here, the amount of times I've had to tell people their literally unconscious friend cannot have another pint | that the coffee place I work at is not, in fact, the only coffee place that charges tax | That we're not living in the 20th century.

HOW DO THIS MANY DUMB PPL EXIST | When an American girl my age said white is white, black is black, brown is brown and asian and asian, I told them they were disregarding the cultural differences between countries like Pakistan and India, Ghana and Jamaica, Korea and Thailand. 

They were from the US and said it was different there and that‚Äôs how it was. I asked them if I put myself (a traveller), a Jewish person and a German in the same room would you think we were the same and they said yes because we‚Äôre all white, it baffled me. 

I couldn‚Äôt believe that so I just said: ‚Äúso you (a Mexican) are just like a Cuban!

One day, the siren goes off when I'm at work. A customer is startled and asks me what that sound is. I tell him it's the weekly tornado siren test. He's confused, and it shows. 

I asked him if he's from the area and explained the weekly test in more detail. He says he is from the area, born and raised, but he's never heard the siren. At this point, I think he's screwing with me. The siren is loud af and he's in his 40s. There's no way he's missed it every week for the last 30 years.

This then turns into an argument between me her and the teacher we worked for where said teacher somehow decides the screaming crying grown woman is deserving of an apology from me and the terrified child and I'm a horrible person who encourages the kids to break the rules and I clearly did it on purpose. 
This woman not only made my student cry but set off every other kid in the class and just about every kid we passed in the hall with all her screaming. All over a stuffed purple cat, which didn't have single spec of dirt on it btw, and they couldn't wrap their head around how that might be a little more concerning than me accidentally giving some kid the wrong toy.

My job had a Halloween trick or treat event for the kiddos and the candy being given out was limited to make sure everyone attending that day could have some. The candy was stored in large plastic bins under the treat booths, which were basically square wooden tables covered and secured to the ground so they couldn‚Äôt blow away, and we‚Äôd use a little bowl to put candy in the kid‚Äôs bags. It looked like the weather might turn, so an employee closed her booth to grab an umbrella just in case. She was gone for maybe 5 minutes, but someone wanted that specific candy so they went behind the booth, pulled out the plastic bin and took some, and a bunch of adults ran up and started ransacking that candy bin, not their children, just the adults grabbing handfuls. I saw what was happening and shouted ‚ÄúAbsolutely not!‚Äù And rushed over. A couple of people ran off, and the ones that stayed literally with their hands in the candy went, ‚ÄúSomeone else opened it and started taking some first!‚Äù I had to stand there like I was their mother going, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care who did this first! You knew it was wrong! Put it back!‚Äù 

These grown people dropped their handfuls of candy back in the bin with sour looks on their faces like it wasn‚Äôt fair some people got to take extra but the didn‚Äôt because they got caught. Mind you, adults were allowed candy, but they had to come around with their bags like the kids and take a little bit, not giant handfuls which they tried stuffing in their pockets and grab more. I told them they should be happy we weren‚Äôt kicking them out entirely, but we didn‚Äôt want to spoil it for their kids. And someone told me they saw the first person who opened the bin and they didn‚Äôt even take a lot for themselves, they wanted a fair amount and were just impatient for the girl to return. The other adults decided since one person already did something wrong it was a free for all and were shoving each other like that bin had the newest electronics at a Walmart Black Friday sale. | That a moose and an elk were two different species | Just the other day, I had to explain to my husband that his pants don't go in the middle of the living room floor, to which he argued he was ""gonna wear them later.""

I had to explain to my dad, a CAD engineer who designed a fucking inertia welder, that this is just...basic math. 

He argued with me for a good while until I got a paper and pencil and worked out multiple family members' birth years and the ages they were on during different years.

I still shake my head about this one. | I recently had an argument with my wife about how you don‚Äôt need to shake a can of baby formula to mix it before you open it.

Back when I was at university I was talking to a student who told me that science had ""disproved philosophy"". Her argument was that famous (possibly apocryphal) story of a philosophy professor putting a chair in the middle of the room and asking students to prove it exists for a final exam. She was like sure that used to be the case but now we have microscopes and stuff and can see the atoms. Went totally over her head that you can question whether those atoms existed or not and she just accused me of being anti-science. | I had to argue that no resource is infinite or truly renewable and there is only so much energy in the cycle.

They insisted that they got a tour of one and the animals lived well. Their friends all agreed 

It shouldn‚Äôt count as rape when a man is forced to have sex with a woman. The scientific definition defines it as being penetrated against your will, which is why rape studies say almost all rapists are men. Feminists lose their minds when you bring this up and point out men report being forced to have sex by women as often as women report being forced to have sex by men.


The US elects the president. They aren‚Äôt appointed by Congress. I had two women insist Congress gets to decide who the president is and the electoral college means your votes literally don‚Äôt matter as Congress can appoint whoever they want. I was also accused of being sexist for trying to explain why that‚Äôs not the case 


People‚Äôs value as human being is determined by their sex and sexual orientation, with lesbians at the top and strait men at the bottom. A lesbian couple said it was ‚Äúdeeply homophobic‚Äù I said sexual orientation doesn‚Äôt determine someone‚Äôs value. They also said since they dealt with homophobia, they were allowed to bully strait men who had never done anything to them.


Treating all black men as rapists until proven otherwise is ‚Äúracist‚Äù, but treating all men until proven otherwise is ‚Äúsmart‚Äù. One of the women argued that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúfact‚Äù most men are rapists.

That the declaration of independent is a legal document and pursuit of happiness is a conditional right

edit: a few days ago a woman was complaining how sexist it was that women convicted of murdering their partners could get life in prison, but men who were acquitted got to go free. My guess is she somehow didn‚Äôt know why OJ Simpson didn‚Äôt get a life sentence | I am COVID cautious.

I went to the doctor wearing a well fitting respirator, and the nurse getting my vitals was wearing a surgical mask.

I said ""Thank you for wearing a mask""

She said ""I'm only wearing it because I'm required to while cases are high. Tomorrow I get to take it off!""

Me: ""Well, thank you anyway.""

Her: ""You should stop wearing masks they're bad for you""

I had already decided to disengage at this point, but she kept going.

Her: ""COVID is smaller than Oxygen, so your mask can't be doing anything or you would suffocate.""

I remained silent and she left. You don't need to know much chemistry to be able to very easily see that's wrong. But she was very confident. Arguing would have been futile.

This is 100% a true story:

Once, when I was like 22, I was sitting in a friend's garage smoking weed with a group of friends I'd gone to high school with. Literally think the basement scenes from That 70s Show but it's happening in the 00s. Someone mentions that they're going on vacation to Savannah with their family. I say something like, ""Savannah is one of the only pretty parts of Georgia because it's one of the only cities Sherman didn't burn.""   
  
There was a dude who hung out with us, who was exactly like this chick. Just absolutely dumb and indignant about it.   
  
Dude looks at me with a straight face and goes, ""Sherman Who?""   
  
I said, ""The Northern general who burned most of Georgia during the Civil War?""  
  
""What war? The North? Like, the Northern US? Like North America? They fought the South? Like Mexico?"" Yes, he meant South America. I know.   
  
I said, ""No man. You know, the CIVIL WAR? The Northern states fought the Southern ones?"" 

""In America? WHEN? Why?""

""Bro, for the love of fuck, what are you talking about? Yes America! Late 1800s? Over slavery? Dude how do you not know this?"" 

""America had slaves?""

At this point, like 3 of us were standing up, just like, out of excitement and confusion, we were looking at him like he was an alien.   
  
He got all mad, like, ""Ok, ok, stop yelling what the fuck, they never taught that in my school."" 

""BRO WE HAVE BEEN IN THE SAME SCHOOL SINCE SEVENTH GRADE, THEY DEFINITELY TAUGHT THIS."" 

""I just don't pay attention to stuff like that, it's not interesting to me."" 

I swear to god, this dude existed. He had a blond blow out in 2003, drove a 1996 Blazer with a $300 subwoofer and every other speaker in the car stock. Florida in the 90s and early aughts. You had to be there. | That wearing effective facemasks and getting vaccinated during a pandemic of an airborne virus that was killing lots of people was basic respect for the people around you. | My friend screamed at the top of his lungs because I said the January 6 rioters were mostly Trump supporters and not ANTIFA. He insisted I must be brainwashed. | Arguing with someone who thought that there was actually a microchip and ‚Äúliquified‚Äù fetuses in vaccines. | It was at the end of October 2020. The person (middle age, college degree) was arguing with me that after the election covid would disappear because ‚Äúit was all made up to make Trump look bad‚Äú.¬† | GMO chickens do not exist. They have never existed. No chicken has ever had a gene inserted into it from another source. In order for any biological thing to be a genetically modified organism, its genes have to have been modified by scientific means to give it a new trait that it would not have gained naturally. This is a very specific part of the definition and is a very different thing than something like corn or dogs that has been selectively bred to enhance traits we found desirable.

Imagine arguing with a person who has two degrees in that very field about whether or not a Cornish cross, a non-reproductive hybrid, was a GMO. They just kept insisting they were correct and that I had an intellectual deficit. A mod even closed comments. Truly a dunning-kruger moment. | That trump really did mock that disabled reporter. There‚Äôs video and witnesses from the event yet people literally deny it ever happened. | That trump really did mock that disabled reporter.

He thought that he didn't specifically hate Jews and he just killed many people generally. Went silent when I asked who the concentration camps are made for.

Also was on my way to save a crow that was being attacked by other crows one day and some staff guy at the school I went to told me, ""leave him and go to class it's God's fate that he dies"" had to explain to him that saving another life is not ""being against God's fate"" | Flat earth. Religion. | Blowing bubbles on the bus is not appropriate. | That Trump sucks and you shouldn‚Äôt vote for him | They tried (vehamently) to convince me that this decade did NOT, in fact, start on 2020, but rather 2021.  I had to clarify, ""No, 2021 is not the beginning, that's a year late.""  
To which I was met repeatedly with ""But it ends with a 1!  You don‚Äôt start a year on January 0th, you start it on the 1st!""
I reply, ""Okay, then how old are you before your first birthday?  Do you just not exist for that first year?""
To which he just got angry all of a sudden and left the house, muttering about me being ""Closed minded.""

1. Animals have a sense of self and experience pain, fear and terror.
2. Animal products taste good.
3. We can survive and thrive on a vegan diet for lower costs.
3. A sensory pleasure doesn't justify breeding animals into existence and killing them way before their time.

Add on the other two big points:

1. Animal agriculture is bad for the environment (leading cause of emissions, inefficienct use of land water).
2. Animal farming is one of the major drivers of health issues (antibiotic resistance, virus mutations like Covid-19).

We didn't have what?

> all that. Up there. 

... *blank* ...

Space?

... *blank* ...

> yes. It's only since they started senting things up there it's been there. 

...

She is also adamant that Eva Cassidy sang 'Over the Rainbow' before Judy Garland, and Judy ruined it. Despite me showing her evidence that no, Judy Garland was born before Eva Cassidy and sang it years before. 

Oh, and after she was one of my infant sons fiddling with himself, she told him in all seriousness to stop or it would fall off. When I asked her not to tell them that because it could give them a complex and was a lie, she told me it was not and she was adamant!

My nan is a blinder lol | This one of my coworkers frl | Maybe they confused Space and Vacuum? | I mean like

My brother told me to show him Behind The CurveüòÇ

He also didn‚Äôt believe we‚Äôd ever been to space and thought it was government propaganda. Good times. | I watch flat earth debates sometimes when bored. The amount of people who would have to be in on it makes it just an impossibly big conspiracy just so NASA can get money, but for some reason all the people who don't work for NASA are also in on. | I like this.

He wasn't wrong. More than half the time, I would hand the gate agent my license and they would say ""you're going to need a passport to board your connecting flight.""

I imagine if I ordered a double cheeseburger she wouldn‚Äôt have known what it was unless I called it a McDouble or whatever. | I could believe after working in a burger shop for long enough she just considered toppings = veggies but to actually think bacon is a plant? | I mean... There is veggie bacon and I do consider bacon a veggie myself but mostly as a joke. 

It's meat... Unless it's fake bacon. | Spain. In a bar that served some food. Asked for vegetarian salad as it was the only thing without meat in the menu. It had bacon bits in it. The staff couldn't understand why I didn't want to eat it.

Edit: When I say bacon bits, I don't mean the brand name, I mean bits of actual bacon. | She‚Äôs from the south. | Okay but did you get the bacon eventually??? | Some Eric Cartman shit | https://www.dieselsweeties.com/archive/931 | rofl | When I was like 16 I worked in a trade as a labor position so I was regularly working with grown men up to 60 years old. One time I‚Äôm with a guy who‚Äôs maybe 30 and another who is a bit older, and 30 year old guy goes ‚ÄúAuschwitz? Like Australia?‚Äù And it turned out he didn‚Äôt know what the holocaust was at all. 

He was pissed that a kid was laughing at him so he said ‚ÄúI bet you don‚Äôt even know about Rochambeau!‚Äù I didn‚Äôt, so I looked it up and was like ‚Äúsome French soldier who helped the US in the revolutionary war?‚Äù And he said ‚Äúno you idiot! It‚Äôs another name for rock paper scissors!‚Äù And both of them started laughing at me, hysterically. 

I think that was the day I truly realized that being an adult didn‚Äôt mean you were smart or had your shit together. Also the day I realized I didn‚Äôt want to be a laborer at 30-50 years old | My country didn't even participate in WW2 so it's not taught in schools much, and we know that! | Sweet jesus all of 8th Grade was like ""holocaust year"". The English classes due Diary of Anne Frank and the History unit spends months on it. We even went to the Holocaust museum (we are a day trip ride from it). I think we have enough history about it to last a lifetime. | Reminds me of the guy that told me he's ""not into obscure literature"" when I referenced The Odyssey. | I feel like when I was in school, they would start with the colonists and run out of time by the time we got through wwi  like three years running. But we did eventually learn WWII. | I quit uni in my second year after a seminar which revealed I was the only person in the group who knew the start and end years of WWII. 

‚ÄúOh did you do history at A-level?‚Äù
‚Äú‚Ä¶No? I‚Äôm just not a moron‚Ä¶‚Äù

A 6th of the course was history. 

In the same seminar, there was a person who didn‚Äôt know who our current Prime Minister was, when another 6th of the course was politics.  

I just didn‚Äôt want my degree to lead people to believe I was as dumb as those idiots. | Back when I was in school, my speech class did an exercise where we had to pull a topic from a hat and improvise a speech. That's when I learned from my sweating classmate all about Adolf Hitler, the great American baseball player. | thats worrying | Not fun fact: 


Many states in the United States do not require Holocaust education and thus there is none. Not going to break down every other country in the world, but too big of a number failed to do so as well. | It would be a bad thing if it WASN‚ÄôT taught in school | Weird. I just got back from the Auschwitz exhibit. Lots of people you wouldn‚Äôt necessarily expect there. | It's because you called them out on their Seig Heil, isn't it? | I took German in high school in the '70s. My teacher was a Holocaust survivor. She taught about the Holocaust and at the end of the lesson she showed her arm tattoo. | Good lord, thats going to be one of those idiots who bangs on about how school taught them nothing because their teachers were bad. | Nah thats just your average american | In some places of the U.S. they might be correct... | *looked up Nazi salute* because I literally didn‚Äôt know until I looked it up | Holy shit. I took a class my senior year that was just called ‚Äúholocaust‚Äù because well‚Ä¶ it was about the goddang Holocaust. | This is funny - but maybe they didn‚Äôt have the luxury of attending school? Or maybe, they got sh*t for brains üß† | I don‚Äôt remember shit from school but the holocaust was one of them how could you forget that | ....wut? | What country did this person come from? | Should search up unit 731 they committed more war crimes than every country in the world during the war | In an old IT office I worked at when I was in my early 20's there was about 7 of us, we went to the pub once and somehow got onto talking about WW2, only 2 of us knew who Stalin was and that still makes me shake my head today lol. We're all British and school definitely teaches about WW2 fairly extensively | Weird, pretty sure I remember learning about the Holocaust in school.... | Adolf Hitler is one of the most famous and well documented people in the history of the world, I‚Äôd be more impressed if somebody didn‚Äôt know who he was. | If we are talking globally then I don't think the average person does know about the actual facts of the Holocaust. But speaking as an american with a grandparent who escaped and was a refugee. I have never met another American without a similar family member who actually knows everything my grandad and his people went through. I equate the education of the holocaust similar to the education of the enslavement of Black people in America. Severely lacking. | Lmao, I remember feeling like 50% of highschool was just Hitler and the holocaust. They must've skipped school more than I did. | I wasn't taught anything in school history lessons about Hitler or the Nazis. I did however have my head endlessly filled with jew propaganda about the ""holocaust"". | Tbf I don't know nazi salute looks like until I specifically looks into it.

Not knowing Hitler or the symbol is bad though | I had a very similar discussion explaining that ""going a mile a minute"" was actually 60mph. The girl could not grasp that concept. | I had a way too long conversation with a friend to describe how 60 miles per hour was the same as a mile per minute. | Try to explain why going 60mph one mile takes 60 seconds. Going 120mph one mile takes 30 seconds. If it takes 45 seconds to go one mile you are not going 90mph. Most people have a hard time grasping this. | Similar energy: I had an argument with my 25 year old roommate that a pot of water would boil faster if you turned the stove on higher heat. (He had been boiling water on medium-low.) He wouldn't believe me until I send him a link to an online article that backed me up. | Reminded me of this gem: [https://youtu.be/Qhm7-LEBznk?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/Qhm7-LEBznk?feature=shared) | I think I was about 5 or 6. My dad was driving and I asked him how fast we were going. He said, ‚ÄúSixty miles per hour,  ‚Ä¶ A mile a minute!‚Äù | I shared a video of a company that travels around with a giant treadmill and they challenge people to see how long they can keep Eliud Kipchoge's marathon pace (13 mph) as he can run a marathon in 2 hours. ""That's stupid, why are they speeding it up that fast?"" Because that's his pace. ""No it isn't, that's *uckin' stupid!"" Even after explaining that it's 26 miles... divided by 2, she was still rolling her eyes. I gave up.

I mean, it IS a ridiculous pace, but that's his pace. | When I taught my grandson to drive, I took pains to caution him on distractions. He told me that a text only takes a minute. Driving 60 mph, I had him close his eyes for one minute. When I stopped, he was amazed at how far we traveled in that time. Almost ten year after, he still remembers that experience | I ran a 5k, finished, and was hanging around for the awards. The 10-mile people started finishing, two guys came in right around 59 minutes - nice! Later at the awards, the announcer said, ‚ÄúAnd look at our top two finishers finishing in under 60 minutes! They ran 10 miles in 60 minutes!! That‚Äôs like‚Ä¶30 miles an hour!!!‚Äù. Sooo close, I looked at my son and we literally both facepalmed. | rapper Quavo once said in a song, ‚Äúim going a mile a minute‚Äù. good on him for practicing safe speed limits! | I'm curious to know how far they thought you'd travel at that speed in an hour. | Bruhhh | Schools pass anyone along to keep their ratings up.

The legacy of NCLB | I once had an ex, who had a doctorate, ask me if a nearby town was ‚Äúnorth of us because it‚Äôs higher on the mountain.‚Äù At least she had a concept of elevation, I guess. | When I worked at Wendy's, people would regularly ask what comes on a maple bacon chicken croissant. 

This reminds me of that. It's a very hard question to answer without feeling super condescending. | My brother tried telling me stars that are 10 light-years away, it takes millions of years for the light to reach us. And that I didn‚Äôt know what a light-year was | I had an argument with one a pre-calc II professor about what % grade means, my stance being ""5% grade means you drop 5% of a mile over a mile"" and they were adamant that it meant 5 feet every 100 feet, **and not 5% of a mile per mile**.


Yes. They're the same thing. I tried explaining that, and they did not agree. But yeah. Fun times. | What did they think it meant? | This reminded me of the time I tried to ask my aunt what was heavier a pound of bricks or a pound of feathers and could not convince her that 1 pound is not heavier than 1 pound | But what if you‚Äôre not planning on being out that long? | What weighs more a 100 pounds of feathers or a 100 pounds of steel? | Well I hope you have a very better day. | Easier to say 1 mile per minute | Must‚Äôve been one of those childs they left behind | Omg I had this same discussion with a woman I worked with, we.drove together for the same job. She was about 35 at the time and it had never dawned on her | 1 mile per minute | it is really disturbing how many adults are in positions lacking the proper math/science/comprehension skills required | Had to do the same in my early twenties, but at least the other dude was like 18 or so. | My brain doesn't do a good job with numbers. I remember having this issue as well. ü´£

I kept trying to apply my real-life experiences to it. Like driving (riding) from my house to an hour away destination. It wasn't until my dumbass finally realized they meant going EXACTLY 60 mph for an hour, no stops. ü¶§ I was trying to include highway and in-town travel where the speed limit can range 35-55. | But how fast is the tire spinning? | i‚Äôve also had this exact conversation with a friend | this reminds me of a discussion I had with an older woman whose husband had been in the diplomatic corps. she was explaining how, when they lived in South Africa, south was up and north was down. because they were below the equator | So then‚Ä¶what did they think it meant? | my dad once had an electrical engineer peer speed up on the highway to get to the gas station faster after the low fuel light came on | [This](https://youtu.be/f43X6u5hPww) always cracked me up | Damn I'm terrible at math but this made me feel a little better about my lack luster understanding arithmetic | Try saying ""Good morning"" on Reddit in the Southern Hemisphere. It's not just having to explain what time ones and other countries are. But it's the amount of times I've had to do it. I'd share a ride with your colleague any day over this disappointing fact. | What did he think was happening? | You can understand it once you realize some people got through difficult subjects, especially math and education, by avoiding things. Sure they could do math, but so much of an experience has been built around it you dont process details that may seem clearer to others. Mph becomes just a measurement, like a symbol. Similar to words like quart, and centimeter, etc. sure if you really thought about the word you might figure it out, but in the world today, how necessary has that been. 

words can sometimes explain themselves but its a bit presumptuous, dare i say elitist, to think someone will always be able to explain the words over their personal relationships with it. | Well, maybe back in the days (pre-Covid), but you need to consider inflation.

/-s | Nah I‚Äôve had this argument as well üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ | I have this question in my test for the students who I might add are all adults. Nearly all put the wrong answer of 30mins- the question is if your driving at 60mph how long will it take you to drive 20miles? | Wait, what? What was their line of thinking with this lol | I bet they knew how many grams were in an ounce tho.... ü§£ Lol | I knew someone in middle school who thought it was miles pern hour | Was it because they wanted to take the size of the tires into account? Bahaha | Weirdly enough, older brother explained this to me when I was learning to drive. Math had never been an easy subject for me in school & it unlocked a part of my brain that actually made it easier to understand math. | I misread this at first and thought you were saying that you had to explain that it didn't work like that and I had to sit and think about what else it could be for a couple minutes before I reread it and realized | I had to explain to my best friend (24M) that speed 60 in all vehicles is same

Like he believed in sedans 60 was faster than hatchbacks

He even did a test for this with a friend and proved his theory right üòÇ(i think it was our other friend just messing with him by going 70 or 80 when he was supposed to go to 60 only or maybe his speedometer was broken or something) | Wait. Wait. *so you‚Äôre saying‚Ä¶* | Yeah, it's also a mile a minute. | That's not even math.

That's not knowing what ""per"" means. | One of my buddies friends on a bachelor party thought that things like wind speed and other factors meant that ‚Äú60 mph‚Äù may not actually mean you go sixty miles in an hour. After a full weekend of using different arguments and analogies didn‚Äôt get anywhere with it. He‚Äôs a father now. | Then how come Canadian miles are so much shorter? | You don't actually have to do any math either.  It's spelled out for you. | You reminded me of this very old video: https://youtu.be/Qhm7-LEBznk | I remember learning that when I was about 10 | Honestly that‚Äôs just as much a language problem as a math one. | https://youtube.com/shorts/xPacvPIjYM4?si=qbkEDZz9Ion7Y_Lu obligatory video | I think I had this happen to me recently but it was something else that was in the simar vein. 

I just think it never clicked in my mind until it dawned one day not that I couldn't figure it out but it is something that I never thought about correlating other than it just being another symbol that shows up in in life regularly. | Damn that‚Äôs just basic math üò≠ | Lol they said adult | But what if it‚Äôs uphill? | Well that actually depends on your average speed of your drive a constant speed of 60 mph yes, but in reality you don‚Äôt there‚Äôs lots of slowing down and stopping along the way. | You should have proceeded to tell the college about distance vs displacement. How you can travel 60 miles and be 60 miles away or be 30 miles away or even 0 miles away from your starting point. | My friend and I were in a car going 55.  The car ahead of us was going the same speed but my friend thought that since they were ahead of us they must be going faster.  I could not convince him otherwise. | Same. ""How many miles can you drive in 60 minutes"" ""fast? Probably like 200 or something"" And it blew their mind it was ""200 miles... *Per hour*"" | What did they think it meant? | When I was a pre teen I asked the question ‚Äúif you‚Äôre going 80 mph, how long will it take you to go 80 miles?‚Äù To my best friends older sister/ my uncles then gf. The adults were drinking, but this woman went all in on this question. She had us ask it in different ways, broke out a calculator AND pen and paper, and still couldn‚Äôt figure it out. 

She‚Äôs still dumb as shit lol. | Social promotion. | Oahu, Okinawa, same diff, right?

üòâ | I read this as Oklahoma at first, and was even more confused. | Ot reminds me this old joke.

- Julius, what's the capital of Gaul?
- Rome.
- wrong. What the capital of Illiricum?
- Rome.
- wrong again. What's the capital of Egypt?
- Rome.
- Julius Caesar, you failed your geography exam.
- we'll see. | Okinawa is the Hawaii of Japan, so‚Ä¶ basically it‚Äôs Hawaii‚Ä¶ | I understand why someone might think that initially, but the stupidity is for sure in the refusal of learning better. Pity, sometimes it's fun to get corrected and learn better info! | I knew a guy who thought Kristallnacht was the German word for Hanukkah but he was very gracious about being corrected | To be fair, you can find drunk Marines at both. | Mr. Myagi enters the chat... | As someone that‚Äôs been there multiple times, It‚Äôs basically a Hawaiian island lmao | We were teenagers, not adults, but I once had a friend argue with me that Kazakhstan wasn‚Äôt a real country and that Sasha Baron Cohen had made it up for Borat. | West-west Hawaii Island | My wife‚Äôs friend asked if Arkansas was on the coast. She has an MBA and works for a major US bank. She‚Äôs is also really bad at math and has no idea how interest rates work despite selling loans as her primary job. She at least acknowledges that she‚Äôs not very smart. | I lived on Maui for years and waited tables there. I had a customer once who thought the closest island was Japan. You could literally see it from where we were (it was Lanai). | There was a time when certain elements tried to *make* it one... | What?!  :/ | They filmed Karate Kid 2 in Hawaii where it doubled for Okinawa. Maybe that's where they're getting confused. | Manifest Destiny is *back,* baby! | To be fair, in Karate Kid 2 they go to Okinawa and if I am not mistaken they filmed it in Hawaii. (Or at least part) So if this all he has ever seen of Okinawa‚Ä¶ | In fairness, the Hawaiian archipelago is really, really long.  Midway Island is part of it, and that's like 2000mi away. | Well, as I hear it told on the internet, Japanese people do love to go to Hawa'ii to have sex with black people, so... close enough? | That‚Äôs really sad. | Holy fuck, this sounds depressing as hell.

I'm a guy, so I can't properly imagine being pregnant, but the thought of this woman feeling like she just randomly came down with a case of a baby literally out of nowhere seems terrifying. | This is legitimately an education issue, not a stupidity issue. | This is why sex education must be taught. Abstinence only education is not ok. | How did she react to the news? | This makes me mad as hell | Did she seem like she understood once you told her? | So absolutely insane that this is true, but I know it is true. Even Neanderthals or animals would understand that. Or maybe they didn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know !! I‚Äôm going to be thinking about this for WEEKS. What her mother told her, if anything? Or the men? Did the men even know?? | I had to explain to a 40 year old American woman, who had a college degree, that there was more than one hole down there (urethra, vagina) she thought it was just one hole everything came out of. And she had 2 kids. Her husband was baffled by her ignorance | This made me think of dragon Ball z abridged where Goku pops in and says Bulma, sex makes babies. While Bulma is literally holding baby trunks. | Again, that's a Catholic Education for you. | Holy shit, This one is funny. Can you imagine the asswooping her husband must have gotten when she went home? | In Saudi Arabia they had to set up classes for young couple to teach them sex that WOULD produce babies.  Unfortunately anal sex is usually well known to them from less than voluntary experience and so they just continue with that.  Got to flip her over dude. | Was she Mennonite? | Hard to believe this one | Someone told me that they used to have herpes but they don't anymore (tbf, I guess they haven't had an outbreak in decades). | Reminds me of people who think that HIV is spontaneously created when two men have sex. | Sounds like a person who listened to half of a medical anthropology explanation about how labeling can cause stigma. | They will be in for a surprise when syphilis makes its ugly return. Then the brain damage will REALLY begin. | FYI: the plural of ""STD"" is ""STDs"". An apostrophe does not make an initialism plural. | That tracks all too well | I mean they had syphilis. if they had something called STD, the doctor would've said that, no? | The syphilis clearly went to their brain | For some reason this made me think ‚ÄúThey played stupid games but have no idea what they won‚Äù lol | A guy I know said that only women get STI's and only men get STD's. 

He also got really upset that I take a contraceptive that stops your periods. He said it was dangerous to not let it come out....he genuinely thought I had 20 years worth of periods blood just floating around inside me and was so worried. bless his heart. | ? ""I've had syphilis in the past""

""It hasn't gone away, but I got it before today, so technically I had it in the past"" | One of my favorite stories was one year I was Christmas shopping, with my younger brother who was probably 18ish at the time, at a sporting goods store. I was like ""Hey they have live reindeer in back, they're pretty cool,"" He thought I was messing with him. So we went to go look. He just stared blankly at them for a few beats then meekly asked "".....can they fly???"" | I had to explain to another adult that a mouse does not grow up to be a rat. | I had to prove this to an adult once as well. This same person also refused to believe there are no penguins at the north pole. | Reindeer weren‚Äôt real until I went to Iceland and found out how muscular and aggressive they were. | Lily Allen (the singer) had to be convinced by her daughter that Reindeer were real. She thought the species were made up like Unicorns. | Fun fact: all of santa's reindeer are female (even rudolph).

Caribou (aka Reindeer) of both sexes grow antlers. However the males really only use them during ""the rut"" (mating season when they are competing/fighting against other males to secure a mate). Once the rut is over, they shed the antlers (since antlers require a lot of energy to maintain). However the FEMALE reindeer keep their antlers since they sue them to protect themselves and their young through the winter. As a result, the ONLY reindeer you will ever see that still has antlers on during the winter will all be females. So depsite their masculine-presenting names, alllllll of Santa's reindeer are actually females. | I thought they are Elk.  I looked it up. 2 different animals.  TIL. | As are narwhals | I'll be honest I thought Jackelope were real until about 30. | There was a church that was doing something for Christmas. Something with indoor games where you win prizes. It was spelled ""raindeer"" games. 

I asked what the joke was and why was it spelled that way. A full grown woman said ""it doesn't matter, reindeer aren't real anyway."" | I had to convince someone pants were alive and he like imitated a zombie, put his arms out and started lurching around saying ""yeah man, look at me, I'm a plant"". | While I do know they are real, there were a couple things I learned about them more recently. 1. They run kinda funny. 2. They are much shorter than I thought they were. | My sister said when we were younger ""there are no deer in Australia"" and she was ready to die on that hill. We saw one when we were on a train and she still didn't believe it. | They're called Caribou in Alaska and Reindeer in Northern Europe. | Admittedly as a kid this is a very confusing concept given how many deer-like animals there actually are, but none of them live in Australia.

It's like how squirrels also live on every continent *except* Australia.

We're a weird place. | Next you're gonna say Harambe was real! üôÑ | Ok this was me. I didn‚Äôt know reindeers were real till I was about 32. | I had a very similar discussion with a friend of mine about Narwalls. Not the flying bit tho.

It was quite the struggle to get her to believe that they weren't make-believe. 

TBH tho, I did have a reputation of pulling peoples legs with wild urban legends, so I didn't fault her too much. | I recently learned that Narwhals were real. I was in an argument with someone about mythical creatures and I brought up a Narwhal and they had to tell me they were real.

I cannot grasp the thought of a sea unicorns being real. | There were a surprising amount of adults in my experience who didn‚Äôt know reindeer were a real animal. | Can confirm, I've got one in my living room. | And they are female. Males don't have antlers over winter. They drop them in the fall. Take that Santa! | Same with narwhal. Many people believe they are fictional creatures, like unicorns | Similar vein narwhals | im mean... we call them caribou here, reindeer just isnt our name for them in north america | They are also beautiful majestic beast.¬† | A lot of places call them caribou. Those are the countries that eat them.¬† | Same convo but with narwhals | I had the honour of letting an adult in her late twenties know that narwhals are in fact real animals, not mythical. | I mean I saw them on people‚Äôs rooftops when I was in a small village in Norway so I can‚Äôt say for sure that they didn‚Äôt get there by flying | It took me way too long to realize that reindeer and caribou are the same thing. | Reindeer and Caribou are the same animal just different continents | so are narwhals. people never believe this | And they are extremely tasty | Yes they are and they‚Äôre very tasty | I lived near a reindeer farm. Several times I had to explain to people that reindeer are real and had to show them the sign and deer. Yes, a couple of them still thought it was some gimmick | Reminds me of a time i had to convince someone that narwhals were not fantasy like unicorns. | I had to convince my wife of this just a couple years ago. She was positive I was pulling her leg and I was just dumbfounded. | I knew two separate people who didn't think reindeer were real. 

They had degrees. | I have eaten reindeer. Pretty decent stuff. | I kinda sympathize with this one. I thought fireflies were a Disney thing and not real until my 20s. You are telling me there are majestic glowing insects flying around? Okay yeah what ever. (I grew up in a barren waste scape and everything bites and stings you). When I finally seen them I completely freaked out with joy. My friends had a good laugh at my expense. | Just recently I learned that caribou and reindeer are the same animal, it's just that reindeer are domesticated. Fun fact if anyone didn't know | They go by another name people often know them as: caribou. | I had a similar experience trying to get someone to believe that UFOs are real. Not flying saucers, not aliens, just objects in flight that can't be identified by the viewer. She was adamant that there is no such thing as a UFO, everyone knows what everything in the sky is at all times. Couldn't be convinced that experimental aircraft are a thing and that they're the reason why UFO sightings are common near military air bases. *Someone* knows what they are, sure, but to most of us they'd be unidentifiable. | I thought a Wolverine was a mythical creature until I was told by a guide on a boat in Tofino to look out for Wolverines. His side of the story is probably funnier. I must have been 26. | One of my daughters' housemates at university, studying for a bachelor's degree in a technically demanding subject, laughed when my daughter said she'd been to a farm where they had reindeer recently. She thought she was joking because reindeer aren't real, are they? | I went on a class trip to the zoo once. They had some reindeer there. The only reason I remember this was because it peed on a classmate.¬† | Had a very a very similar discussion in highschool where I was unfortunately outnumbered, ""Yes, I know what a 'snipe hunt' is.  No, that doesn't mean that snipe are made-up."" | I actually used to think they were not real, my husband (then boyfriend) had to take me to see some to prove they were in fact very much real.... That made its way into his wedding speech üòÖ | I think it's kind of natural though to come to the conclusion that they aren't real, at least in the US, since they're mainly associated with Santa Claus. | Someone told a kid in my class that if a stop sign has a white border the ""stop"" is optional. He came in really pissed the next day that he got a ticket | Could the person read? | What did they think it meant? | There's something wrong with that SOP sign. | I knew a guy who would always blow past stop signs. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry‚Äù, he says ‚Äúmy brother does this all the time.‚Äù

We came to a green light and he suddenly slammed on the brakes.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you doing?‚Äù I screamed!!

Absolutely fearfully he said ‚Äúmy brother might be coming!‚Äù | I definitely thought stop ""all way"" signs (usa) meant to come to a complete stop no matter what.... wheras the rest of the stop signs were more like suggestions and rolling stops were alright if no other cars were around. 
I was mayhe 14 or so when I learned otherwise. | Lol this happened to me last month. I honked at him when he didn‚Äôt stop at the stop sign I was stopped at in my neighbor (where kids and families walk!!!! But I digress.) so he pulled over and he *did* take the time to stop and ask what my problem was. I was like you didn‚Äôt stop at the stop sign, he said it doesn‚Äôt matter, it‚Äôs who gets there first! I know this man KNEW you stop at a stop sign but he wouldn‚Äôt admit it and I had to move on at a certain point lol. | When my little brother was learning how to drive, he ran a stop sign and almost T-Boned another car.  We all yelled at him and asked why he didn‚Äôt stop. He genuinely believed that stop signs were optional. | Did they just slow down and then go, or just never slow down? If there's literally no one around I don't always make a complete stop. But only in areas where I can literally see down the street both ways and there's no cars blocking me from seeing pedestrians. But I still Know the law | ‚ÄúSlow To Observe Police‚Äù | Tis merely a suggestion, my dear sir | Were they from California?

Rolling stop signs are called ‚ÄúHollywood‚Äù stops here lol | The thought it meant ‚Äòstaaawpp‚Äô | Damn you must live in my town üòÇ cuz people over here drive stupid as hell | Inflammable means flammable?! What a country! | Thinking about it, their name should be more like pause signs. When a construction worker holds up a sign saying stop, it means to stop, not to stop and then go. | In the UK you don't actually have to completely stop at a stop sign like I the us | Will be downvoted to hell, I'm sure, but I personally don't actually *stop* at the stop sign. 

I moreso slow down and creep at a snail's pace while checking to see if it's clear. | There's a story of some competitor of McDonald's putting out a burger called the Third Pounder that didn't sell well because people assumed the burger was smaller since 3 is smaller than 4. I don't know how true that is though. | Although it wasn‚Äôt an argument, I was getting deli meat at Walmart once and asked for a half pound of turkey. I was given .30 pounds. I told her that was less than I wanted, and I wanted a half pound. She told me that would be .30 since 30 minutes is a half hour. | Forget the label. Couldn‚Äôt you just visibly see that the 1/3 was bigger than the 1/4??? | I'm a math teacher. I would've walked her over to the loose beans and pulled out twelve beans, then had her count them.

How many beans are there?  

12!  

Good. Now, I'm going to divide them into fourths. How many beans are in each fourth?  

3!

Great, remember that. Now, let's return all the beans to one pile and split them into THIRDS. Now, how many beans are in each third?  

I'm not dumb, you know. You can't trick me.  

I'm not trying to trick you. Just tell me how many beans are in each third.  

*slowly counts* 4!  

Great, so, do you see that you get more beans in a third than you do in a quarter?  

Yes.  

So, which pack will give you more meat?  

The quarter, because the 4 is bigger than 3!  

FML... | when i worked at a fish and chip shop we had 1/4lb and 1/2lb burgers. i had at least 7 fully grown adults ask me which one was bigger | Wow, the nerve. ""Your wife would know that."" Some people. üôÑ ""Babysitting for mom?"" vibes.

If that's what we're doing today then, *why don't you ask your husband to teach you some money math, dear.* | Yep.  When I was 20 I worked in a sheet metal processing facility as summer help.  I was lucky enough to be put on the line and became a temporary member of the team that ran that line.  These guys were amazing to me.  So patient.  They showed me the ropes and helped me learn the job.  We took our lunches together and hung out together every day.  

One day I walked into the lunch room and the guys were all arguing about something.  I sat down and they all looked at me.  One guy says ‚ÄúOK college boy.  You tell us the right answer.  Which is bigger?  1/4 or 1/3?   I stopped for a moment, looked around suspiciously and I said 1/3 is larger.  Assuming they were fucking with me as they usually did.  

This started the argument right up all over again.  I let it go on for awhile before I got up and grabbed some paper and a pen from the office next to us.  I then had to draw two circles and said they should imagine it‚Äôs pizza.  I then split one circle into quarters and the second circle into thirds.  Then I asked which piece of pizza is bigger?  1/4 or 1/3.  God, I loved those guys, but they could be so god damn dumb. | Love the generous side dish of condescension, too ‚Äî ‚Äúyour wife would know that.‚Äù | Yes.  I taught fractions in special education.  It has to be taught carefully or people can get very confused, very quickly! | Four thirds of the population struggle with fractions. | Not quite adults yet, we were in our junior year in high school, but still... My ex bf was telling me about NASCAR (he loved fast cars, I was a math nerd). He told me the track is a mile long. Then he told me that the cars go 180 miles an hour. So I said, then they go 3 laps every minute. Then he kept insisting no, they go more than that. After a few back and forths, I broke down the simple mathematics that proved to him that it equals 3 miles a minute times 60 minutes equals 180 miles an hour. He then proceeded to argue with me that MATH is wrong. I stopped there. | I work some nights in a deli and I‚Äôve lost track of the number of times I‚Äôve had to explain fractions to both customers and my coworkers. | ""Madam, my wife has a 3rd grade education. She knows 1/3 is more than 1/4.""

Realistically, as her how many quarter-pounds makes a pound. And how many third-pounds makes a pound. Maybe that would work?

But since she's so willingly ignorant, just ask her to sign a contract agreeing to never breed and be done with it. | The most insulting part is the last unnecessary sentence by that woman.

I‚Äôm the primary culinary person in my household, as I went to school for it.  The number of times I‚Äôve been womansplained things at the grocery store or market‚Ä¶

Also, when did fractions become so difficult to understand? | a 1/3 lbs is larger than a 1/4 ...your husband would know that | Maybe she doesn't think highly of your wife? | Makes me wonder if she wanted the one in your hand, and was trying to get you to choose a smaller one. | I‚Äôm fine with someone being dumb, but the ‚Äúyour wife would know that‚Äù smug little comment when they are wrong would get under my skin lol | And this is someone who drives... | she must be a Trump voter, low IQ right there | Know a teacher that lost his mind because a girl couldn‚Äôt understand 1/4 of a paper is smaller than 1/3 of a paper and I think he lost all will for teaching. | ‚ÄúNah. My wife is not an idiot.‚Äù | >Even explaining the math and showing her the weight in ounces on the package

I see recaps of frustrating interactions like this with strangers so much on Reddit and it always baffles me. I cannot imagine being remotely fucked to try to educate someone like this. The most I can possibly do is just chuckle and go ""yeah"" then walk away. Call me introverted I guess but I have approximately a thousand things I'd rather be doing than engaging with a random idiot in a grocery store. | 1/3 is larger than 1/4. Your husband would know that. |  that's a classic example of how some people get so hung up on their perspective that even simple facts can't penetrate their bubble. Doesn't matter how you spin the numbers; if they're not open to it, it's like talking to a wall. | ‚ÄúYou have an item that weighs 1.2kg. If you divide it by three, each piece is 400g. Divide it by four and each piece is 300g.‚Äù | oh my god that's so sad. | r/confidentlywrong | Did she like it because it has more electrolytes | ‚ÄúOh, I didn‚Äôt realize 33 cents was less than 25 cents! What about a half-dollar coin while we‚Äôre at it?‚Äù | Jesus. We are DOOMED. | This is actually the reason A&W had to stop making 1/3 lb burgers, since people thought it was less. | And to think, that woman is smarter than 70% of Americans | >Your wife would know that.  
  
Yeah dumb men can't grocery shop... | ‚ÄúYour wife would know that‚Äù bitch what? | Do you get more pizza if you share it with 3 or 4? | In a similar vein, I had an argument with my 4th grade teacher. She was pretty sure she was right that km are bigger than miles because on a speedometer 60mph is 100kph. | stay in school kids! üòí | ""... and I bet your husband knows you're an idiot."" | Reminds me of when I had to explain to someone that 1080p is 2K. | Yeah but your wife would know that üôÑ | Jesus wept. | She needs a pie chart | Burn on your wife. | Omg. ""Your wife would know that"" lol | Why show a perfect stranger how confidently incorrect you are?? | I sell electric motors for HVAC systems, pumps, stuff like that. Sometimes we run out of 1/4 HP motors. Without fail, some one will tell me that they would take the 1/3 HP motor, but they don't want to go down in HP. I don't know how these people get licensed. | She didn't understand a fraction of your explanation. | >It's smarter to buy the larger package for the same price. Your wife would know that

She's a real size queen. | So our education system has always been bad, got it | She‚Äôs gotta be the worst cook in the world. | Great.  You give me 1/4 of a dollar and I'll give you 1/10 of a dollar. | ""Pfft what?? 4 is bigger than 3, everyone knows that!""

 -Some older lady at aisle 2 | You‚Äôre nicer than me. | I made that mistake once when I was about 10, in class, the first time learning about fractions, and only because I was inattentive. | I actually had an adult (that had children too) point to a paper and ask me what the symbol meant. It was a fraction. Like straight up never even saw a fraction before. Had another adult ask me how many third cups make one cup. | In fairness this is basic psychology not maths. It just seems bigger even though it isn't. | I get the feeling that maybe she just didn't want to admit that she's been buying the more expensive version for potentially years | I would have explained it by showing her the decimals....1/3 is .33 and 1/4 is .25 and .33 is clearly bigger than .25

but at some point you have to resign to the fact that ""I can explain it to you, but can't make you understand it"" | These people need to be laughed at out loud. Please laugh at them! They need it. | This is how old ladies propose marriage. You should be flattered¬† | The average person is so god damn dumb

And half the population are even dumber | ‚ÄúYour wife would know that.‚Äù üòÇüòÇ | Her husband would know that. | One of my fun things to do is to go up to a deli when a teenager is on duty and ask for a third of a pound of something. Most don‚Äôt know what to do and one actually told me that their scale can‚Äôt weigh that amount. (one of my other fun things to do is when asked at a sandwich shop ‚Äúwhite or Wheat‚Äù. I always ask, what is the white made out of. Few know) | But why argue with some rando in a grocery store? | You should have pulled out your phone and used the calculator to change both into decimals.

He was trying to contact a Canadian client but their office was closed, because July 1 is their independence day. He goes ""oh, right, it's the 4th of July up there today."" He thought they celebrated American independence day, just that they used a different calendar. | This is honestly hard for me to even comprehend | 5th of July = Wednesday 

4th of July = Tuesday

3rd of July = Monday

2nd of July = Sunday

1st of July = Saturday

The hell are you talking about? That seems so easy to explain lol | They don‚Äôt pay you enough for that | It depends on which month July falls on. | This is a first. I hope it‚Äôs a last | effin really, a couple weeks ago, there was this discussion on what a slur is and a few people got in a tizzy that only what they deemed to be slurs were slurs and I sent them the dictionary defintion for slur and then was met with ""See, this is how wrong you are. You're trying to resort to an appeal by definition""

... we were TALKING About its definition, trollop. | I dislike how when I'm googling the definition of a word the first result is no longer the dictionary and is instead Google's AI that I can't turn off | People like this should not reproduce | ... They're not quite right but it's more complicated than that.

Language (except for field specific jargon) is descriptive not prescriptive. Even dictionaries acknowledge that they're just explaining the language rather than defining it these days due to starting to hire academic linguists.

It's really not uncommon for terms to develop usages that are not yet in dictionaries that are commonly understood.

It's also quite common for terms to simply be poorly defined for what it's supposed to contain.

So, dictionaries need a grain of salt, probably good to know the topic and the argument. | Where are they from? | ‚ÄúWestern dictionary‚Äù?  Is that like a warm-water port? | To be fair there is some argument that language is not just what is written in the dictionary, but what is currently happening out in the world. I.e. the kids might be making up new words every day and using them as commonplace but they won‚Äôt be in the dictionary yet. But I don‚Äôt think they were thinking that deeply into it lol | ""It was written by old white men"" was how it was explained I couldn't use a dictionary definition to prove she was wrong. I just packed up after that as there's no chance of meaningful debate if we can't even agree on what words mean. (I'm aware the wording makes this seem like anti-woke panic, it isn't, I'm left-wing. She was just a dumb fuck). | This sounds like people misinterpreting how words work. Words do indeed change meaning over time, but that doesn't invalidate the word's previous usage compared to what it is now.

Take this and realize that every generation generates new slang, and there's different slang for different social groups, different countries, different races, different cultures, etc. | Well, it's notable to me that Merriam-Webster and Oxford define the word ""communism"" very differently | Which word? | Elon's plan is working | Similarly, I've had someone argue that context had no significance to the meaning of a word. Even after I gave examples of words with multiple definitions that vary *based on context*. | I‚Äôve been through that mess. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt trust dictionaries to define words, because dictionaries were written be rich white men‚Äù. | On one hand, language is living and changes constantly, on the other hand twitter is really stupid. | In a sense twitter is a better source. The goal of a dictionary isn‚Äôt to tell the world how a word is used, but to catalogue how people use words. Kinda like how an encyclopedia might have an article about the  tallest building in the world. If someone builds a taller building, the encyclopedia becomes wrong and out of date.

Similarly, if people coin new words, or change the meaning of words, then the dictionary becomes out of date.

Here‚Äôs a dictionary author talking about this


https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ov-Sh8UDnhU | They been reading too much Newspeak | I‚Äôm betting money this was an old person. Their susceptibility to social media lies is astounding. | In fairness, they're taking a good point - cultural context affects how words are used, and dictionaries are often very generic - and they're stretching it into something absurd. | Life pro tip: if you're ever unsure what a word means, look it up! 

There's never any shame in trying to expand your vocabulary. There is shame in repeatedly using a word incorrectly and remaining wilfully ignorant. | Did you tell them that they‚Äôre dumb as fuck lol | Schizophrenic, or just generally paranoid/delusional? | Idk what else to say, except jfc. | I just want to give up.  Good lord we are fucked. | I've have people attempt to explain to me that sometimes ""to"" and ""too"" are interchangeable, and they would not accept that they were different words. | The uneducated conspiracy nuts are going to be the fucking fall of humanity. We have the world at our fingertips and this actual level of stupidity still exists. | To be fair, when he said it was propaganda, he could‚Äôve meant something entirely different‚Ä¶ | Big dictionary is trying to indoctrinate you. | Wtf!!!! How do these people intend to be a functioning member of society? | I'm convinced that when most people say dumb shit like that it's purely to go on the attack and discredit anything that disagrees with them, without actually putting any thought into it at all.  It's not an actual belief they want to convince you of, it's just a weapon to throw in a fight. | I have had this argument with someone on reddit.¬† I defined democracy they said thats not what it means.¬† I said that is the literal definition of democracy they said, well that may be but that is not actually what it means.... I should have known to stop there.¬† | Oh, so I WASN'T the only person to encounter this dumbass? | I mean they‚Äôre right in terms of words often don‚Äôt really have official meanings and how it‚Äôs used/understood colloquially is just as correct of a definition as what‚Äôs it‚Äôs in a dictionary (which maybe or may not agree with other dictionaries). | Somebody on Twitter once used some random site as a source for defining a word. I poked around the site a little and found that the founder of the site had a blurb written about him that listed his credentials as ‚Äúspeaking and writing English his entire life.‚Äù I pointed it out to her and she asked me who I was to decide which sites were good and which ones were bad. Later she claimed to have been educated at Oxford and called me unhinged. | Wait until you learn about the ""gendersternchen"" in germany

The whole population disliked it because it is grammatically wrong and woke too | I was told that using proper grammar is racist. It was an English lesson. They were trying to write about how ""shook"" they were watching their friend ""slay"" at this game. Not word for word but they were definitely in the same sentence. 2 kids were arguing with me on how they should have been allowed to write it in their essay or I'm a racist. | They really have been convinced that everything outside a handful of sources, who are probably liars and grifters, can't be trusted | You've met Elon? | ‚ÄúWestern dictionaries are propaganda‚Äù is the type of batshit crazy sentences I love hearing. Made me laugh! | The only dictionaries we had access to in jail were from a Christian publisher. It had legal terms in there defined by biblical references. | Are they Ron DeSantis ? | I swear sometimes it seems like people are actively trying to de-standardize english because of how it makes them feel. | Of course, there is no propaganda on Twitter. | They didn't live in the west? I mean if they did, they should be fine with living with the partyline of their native place? | See: Conservapedia and it‚Äôs offshoot, ‚ÄúThe Conservative Bible‚Äù. Both are born of the same impulse you mention.

Bonus points: both are also the product of Phyllis Schlafly‚Äôs son. Phyllis, for those who don‚Äôt know, is pretty much the origin of modern conservative political operations (read: fuck policy, get voters with culture war bullshit) | Ah yes, the book that literally defines words is... *checks notes*... propaganda.

No wonder people are braindead these daysüòë | Not totally true.

Society defines what a word means, the dictionary just annotates it.  Word meanings are created or changed by society first, and then the dictionary follows. | There is ""some"" truth to it. Filipinx was accepted into dictionary.com and many Filipinos find it colonialist as fuck because none of us actually accept the term. Filipino is already a gender neutral word, why make another gender neutral word made by westerners?

Of course it depends what dictionary you read as there are different types written for different eras etc. etc., and for sure a dictionary can't be any worse than searching up words on twitter to find out their meaning. But they're not entirely wrong. | Votes republican | Everyone knows that sheltering under a tree is the safest place to be during a lightning storm.

/s | Everyone knows that's the last place a tree would think to fall. | for real what is the safest place to be?

i‚Äôm assuming the answer is ‚Äúfar as fuck away‚Äù but like, what is the actual answer | As a person that played Valheim, I know this. | As someone who *almost* had a very large, old tree fall on them, it‚Äôs best not to be under it. | I don‚Äôt get it, if you stand right next to it while it‚Äôs falling you can tell which way it is falling and can get out of the way. If you just randomly run it might be falling on you still | Ahhhh a fellow tree surgeon. I've hired people like that, and they also think a chainsaw can cut through dirt just as well | Idk if trees were falling from the sky I‚Äôd like a nice sturdy tree above my head to deflect them | So a tre is falling... And they said the safest place to be is UNDER the FALLING tree.. so DIRECTLY under the FALLING tree.. 


I fkn swear I can't... The point that the guy was fired for SAFETY reasons? I'm out.. | I work in health and safety compliance. I was reading a list of citations, and what was the action plan to avoid repeating the offense. At least one third was ""fired the guy"". | I am stoned.

Are you not a whore then??‚Äù | Sounds like projecting to me | Sounds like the mom (Piper Laurie) in Carrie. | In reality, the explanation for this is probably very sad.  She was abused as a child, probably within a few months of her cycle beginning, and carries some very twisted guilt.  I assume that you are unmarried?  It's not the cycle that made you a whore, it was the unmarried part.  He cycle is explainable today, and not a whore thing. | Sounds like warped religious bullshit...  Probably piled on self shame due to her own periods over her lifetime... | So the mom spent her life thinking she was a whore? Either she has a really weird definition of it, or she just confessed to you that she cheats on her husband and fucks every guy she gets near. | Did you meet Carrie's mother? | I dated a guy that told me it was God‚Äôs punishment because I was a whore.

This should be the top comment on here, this is just mind boggling. | I'm so confused. This woman has had periods... so does she believe she's a whore herself? Is she a hypocrite punishing other women she believes are whores, even though she thinks God is also calling her a whore?

I just... what?

Edit: I want to be clear, I genuinely feel bad for this woman as this seems like heavy religious indoctrination. No woman should be made to feel like a whore over a literal biological function.

The reason why these are considered swear words is because men think it's unnatural to have them, and it's disgusting and you should be hidden away/shut out when on them. So when I came to Canada and got my first period, no one had talked to me about them and I always was full of shame when I had them. I was told I was ""unclean"" because of them. There's a guy who wrote about a man not even eating any food his wife cooked when she had hers, that's how disgusted they are by them.

Met an adult who didn't know this either. | Does this official believe in Jewish Space Lasers or give handies at high school plays? | ""Okay, now look up 'Summer Solstice Australia [insert year you had the argument]."" | Honestly this is a near-daily occurrence for us during christmas if we mention how hot it is, having a BBQ/Pool christmas Lunch or make any mention of the summertime online.

I sometimes get the feeling this sort of stuff just isn't really taught all that often in the Northern Hemisphere considering how frequently it happens. | I mean there was that one official who thought that the island of Guam could capsize. | Who was the politician who thought that islands floated, and too many immigrants might make them sink??

Or the ""the internet is a series of tubes"" politician?

pure gold | In college I also had the same argument about Australian‚Äôs celebrating Christmas in their summer. ‚ÄúNo, their summer is in July like ours, but their calendar is backwards.‚Äù I just‚Ä¶ wtf. | I still remember when our former 45th president said that global warming isn't real because it was cold in Minnesota and snowing | I didn't know this until a couple years ago when I was talking to an Australian friend. Just not really something you think about if you don't travel to another hemisphere or get explicitly told about it. | I will say in her defense it is a rather difficult thing to picture without seeing it. I have known this fact my whole life, but it really didn‚Äôt sink in till I watched ‚Äúa moody Christmas‚Äù on Hulu years ago. Followed an Australian families Christmas for a few years. Each episode was a different year. It was odd watching them have a bbq and pool party at Christmas.¬†

I will say though, it would be a great fun way to celebrate.¬† | I work with candidates and elected officials. It is insane, truly, how fucking stupid some of them are. 

Im a drop out from the florida public education system!! You passed the bar! I SHOULD NOT BE SMARTER THAN YOU!! üò≠üò≠ | In all fairness that concept does kinda fuck with my brain a bit, idk I just associate Christmas with winter and snow ig? I know it's right but it just sounds strange. | Imagine when she learns about the polar summer and winter. | Was it Marjorie Taylor Greene? | You should have also told her that they have the Fourth of July in England. | I used to live in Chile.  Always felt a bit weird about it being so hot on Christmas Day.  But I grew up in the USA.  I guess if I had grown up in Chile, it wouldn‚Äôt have felt weird | What I like about this is how they basically pulled a 'fake news' on you based on *their own* findings | Wait till he realizes that the moon waxes and wanes in the opposite direction in the southern hemisphere... | I spent my first career in state politics.  There are successful politicians that surprise me when they make it to the Capitol on the first try every day. | Growing up in the Southern Hemisphere it confused me how Christmas was always advertised as a snowing season, snowmen and all that. Not really sure when it clicked for me but yes glad to say I have an education. | As someone living in Australia, can confirm this is propaganda. We celebrate Christmas in autumn. | Hah, this reminds me of my ex-boss who was Italian. We were talking about seasons and I was saying how Christmas was so different in Europe because it snowed and was cold etc, and in Australia it's summertime at Christmas. He stared at me in amazement and said ""Christmas is in July in Australia?!"" | > Someone who was an ELECTED OFFICIAL at the time was completely unaware of the fact that 

 they are unaware of soo many of them | As an Australian, this happens pretty often actually. People on the internet get *really* mad at you if you mention that it‚Äôs cold in July here, or if you say that Christmas in the summer holidays. | The first time I heard about it, I thought ‚Äúthat can‚Äôt be right‚Ä¶‚Äù

Then I thought about the angle of rotation and the orbit of the Earth and figured it made sense. I‚Äôd always thought the seasons were due to the Earth‚Äôs orbit rather than the declination angle; summer was at perihelion and winter was at aphelion. A minor amount of thought and research and I accepted the new information before moving on with my life. | I've always wondered about that with enough care to look it up. Do Australians call their hot season (December, January and February) Winter or Summer? | Well, it's hot at the south pole, and cold at the north pole and Australia is closer to the south... so yeah.. | It's weird that we already know that this person is a republican. I wonder why that is. | Why would a teacher of French grade you in a subject of physics (I guess)? | A kilo of feathers is heavier because you also have to carry the weight of what you did to those birds. | [Steel is heavier than feathers](https://youtu.be/-fC2oke5MFg?si=vsvwPUXK-mkUqRZt) | I had this same argument with a friend when I was a kid. She just kept saying ""but stone is heavier than feathers"". We were 10 and I thought she a was moron even then, I can't think for the life of me how an adult, let alone a professor, could be that dim. | Limmy would shit himself if he knew this actually happened. | https://youtu.be/-fC2oke5MFg?si=OQJtmYl1z7MxIb4w

Spent the entire hour telling our elderly basic statistics professor that the probability of having a boy or a girl was 1.
He was supposed to be teaching us. He was supposed to be teaching us. 
It was a remedial math that counted as the only math I needed so I took it. Heaven help the students who actually needed to learn there. | wtf, that's a classic 'trick' question for teachers to identify non-critical thinkers

what an imbecile | hit her with both. | Why is a French teacher grading a science exam? | Did you complain to someone above her? | I had an intro course in statistics and the instructor (a grad student) put a problem on the mid-term that was unsolvable.  When a bunch of us complained that he had left out part of the problem, he got all bent out of shape and threatened to flunk us all.  One of the other students shot his message to the department head and, unsurprisingly, we had a different instructor for the rest of the course.  The new instructor re-graded all of the midterms and we all got full credit for the blown problem. | Not worth an argument | The feathers weigh more as it carries the emotional weight of what you did to those poor birds | Fun facts a kilogram of feather has actually more mass than kilogram a of stone.  

When you account for buoyancy of the atmosphere, the fact they the feathers take more volume than the stone means that more mass is needed to exercise the same downward force. | Tell her that a pound of feathers actually weighs more than a pound of gold and watch her head explode.

Edit: for you downvoters, a lesson: Most (non-metric) things are weighed in the avoirdupois measuring system, where 16 ounces equals one pound. But precious metals like gold, silver, and platinum (and gemstones) are weighed using the troy measuring system, where one pound is only 12 ounces. To convert into grams, one (avoirdupois) pound of feathers weighs 453.59 grams while a (troy) pound of gold weighs 373.24 grams. Ergo, a pound of feathers weighs more than a pound of gold.

If you want to get deeper into it, an ounce of gold weighs more than an ounce of feathers. A troy ounce is 31.1 grams and an avoirdupois ounce is 28.35 grams. [Quick explanation video here](https://youtu.be/peOR94Vzt2E?si=yzX9AlKcvl3qYpZx) | I would be bringing a bunch of feathers, a stone, and a scale to the next class.

""Please take your seat, Ma'am, you're interrupting my class."" | But‚Ä¶how? | I mean, it sounds sorta similar to Anita Bryant logic, a famously homophobic bigot who opposed gay rights on the grounds of her rights as ""a mother"".

Since women find empowerment through motherhood, then the logic is that homosexuality imagines a future or society where women are irrelevant or extinct (I guess?)

... And yeah, this makes no sense, but I guess on a psychological level, some women are sincerely afraid of homosexuality being seen as normal for some reason like that. | Some San Francisco supergeeks modified a mouth bacterium to excrete alcohol instead of acid, so they won't get cavities. It not only works, it spreads by kissing. It can be hazardous to people with a sensitivity to alcohol, though. | You also aspirate saliva and mouth bacteria in your sleep, which means by not brushing, you increase your chances of upper respiratory infections. This is common in older people who stop brushing, and they often die from pneumonia caused by mouth bacteria. (Source: a close friend is a respiratory therapy expert and mostly works with the elderly.)

Even if you literally can't get cavities because you lost your teeth, you need to clean your mouth regularly to control your dangerous bacteria count. | EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW | How do these people even still have teeth.... | scrolling trough this comment section, that's the first one i saw where they actually changed their mind | Everyone don't need to brush their teeth tho. At least not from keeping it free from ""holes"" point of view. Its genetic. | I had a lady go to CBC Radio and tell them I was racist for not returning the jacket she was wearing. 

Yes she purchased it from me but like a year or so before. It had burn holes and stuff in the sleeves. I don't know what CBC ever said to her but she came and happily bought a new jacket the next week. Maybe she was having an off day? I don't know. I'm pretty sure we were the same race though. I didn't ask her but I'm pretty sure. | Just curious what did the police do and how did the woman respond | Straight to jail. | I feel your pain. At my previous job, we only accepted milk bottle returns if they had the grocery store‚Äôs label on it. In other words, if you bought a bottle of milk, we took a deposit and you got it back when you brought the bottle back.

Someone bought a lot of bottled milk from a competitor and tried to get us to accept the bottles. We couldn‚Äôt. They threatened to call the cops and I told them to go ahead. They did and ended up leaving before the cops arrived (cops in my city are notorious for coming 30 mins to a whole hour after a call) and I had to explain to them that the person was an idiot. | The amount of people that don‚Äôt understand map projections is wild | i got schooled on this by an eleven year old recently‚Ä¶ in my defense i was never good at geography, it wasn‚Äôt taught in school, and any time there was something geography-related i was always left behind without understanding | Funny enough, the Mercator projection further enlarges Alaska compared to Texas. | I can see this one. I might have even believed it at some point | And of course Alaska is an island off the coast of California... | Both my parents are pilots. Fuselage is where all the passengers and bags go, not where the fuel goes. It was actually a great lesson to learn in 5th grade that adults can be thick as mud. | The amount of people I have come across who thought that Alaska was an island‚Ä¶ Because of course when they look at a map of just the 50 states, it‚Äôs over in the ocean. | I live in Texas and this is still an issue. | Is ""scale"" really the right word here? It's more of a distortion that just happens to be the simplest way to show the majority of landmass in a single image. | This country sucks so much | Well I had to explain to my year 9 (8th grade?) Science teacher that Earth was closer to the sun tham Mars... | What did he think the words ""rooster"" and ""hen"" meant? | If he was assuming that laying an egg meant it procreated, I could see why he‚Äôd think that. But no, chickens lay eggs whether they‚Äôre fertilized or not. | ""When a mommy hen and a daddy rooster loves itself very much, they call Door dash. 7-158 minutes later someone in a dirty Hyundai Sonata delivers a chicken to you."" | I had a coworker once who was in her late 40s that thought birds didn't have sex because they laid eggs. | I‚Äôve heard of this from Africa where they say the rooster can lay one egg in its life, I wanna say it was from Kenya but I also didn‚Äôt want to associate with this patient anymore. | Tbf I still don't know how eggs get fertilized. Like is it the same way that human eggs get fertilized? Just chickens doing sex? | To be fair I think a lot of people don't know that chicken eggs that we eat are unfertilized, and are essentially their periods. They won't turn into chickens. 

I talked to a Buddhist that didn't eat eggs because they couldn't kill anything. I thought either they didn't know about eggs or maybe they think that eating any meat from an animal breaks that rule. Idk | I had to explain to my fianc√© that hens will lay eggs regardless of whether a rooster is present. 

He was CONVINCED that if we got chickens for eggs, we would have to get a rooster and he didn't want to deal with the crowing. Would not hear anything from me to the contrary. 

It took much Googling from several sources and even calling up my aunt who is a small homesteader to explain things and make him believe me. | This isn't too surprising, but I had chickens and no rooster and it confused a lot of people that yes, chickens lay eggs w/o a rooster. Just something you don't really think about normally. | This reminds me of the time I taught my older friends in college that chicken eggs will not hatch unless they're fertilized. They thought all chicken eggs were fertilized and would've hatched if cared for. | If you don't think about it, it can happen | Was he one of those people who think every chicken egg would become a chick if we didn't eat them? | Yet little ol me at age 5 took great pride explaining to the class how a chicken gets in an egg when we visited a farm. It was our farm. It was my mum who witnessed this with my teacher. Fortunately it was the ‚Äúrooster puts the seed in the mother hen who lays the egg‚Äù without graphic detail of how. | It took me a while to twig that the presence or absence of a rooster in the henhouse was what made the difference between boiled egg and roast chicken.

But I was maybe 14 or 15 - not 45! | This is half true. Hens don't need sex to LAY eggs. They need it to lay fertilized eggs and i guess when they're bored. | I have had MULTIPLE conversations with people who could not understand that my female ducks produce eggs even though I have no males. You need male ducks to get ducklings‚Ä¶ but eggs come no matter what. So bizarre. | Yeah, the idea that you don't need a rooster for your hens to lay eggs is mind-boggling for people. 

The number of people who think chickens have front legs is also terrifying. | So let me get this straight, the rooster has sex with the hen, who's having sex with the chicken? | I went through this one with 4 20-something women who just couldn‚Äôt wrap around their heads that the chicken they were eating was either a hen or a rooster and not a different kind of animal. Then came the bit about how do chickens have sex. | When I was a kid I thought roosters could fertilize the eggs just by being in the vicinity lol | Well he was half right. Chickens are hermaphroditic, but not in the sense that guy thought. If a flock of hens are without a rooster, one hen (usually the mother hen) will become a rooster.  They will crow and lead the group. They will also be the first to protect the rest of the flock. They cannot inseminate, but they will mount. They will also stop laying eggs and just sit. I have seen this in multiple accounts. Although, a rooster cannot become a hen and start magically laying eggs. | I remember having a conservation with someone who did 4H that hens didn‚Äôt need a rooster present to lay eggs. They only needed them to lay *fertilized* eggs. I‚Äôm born and bred from the DC suburbs. | An unfertilized egg is not a ""creation"". | Did he think that chickens were actually feathered earthworms? | [**This is actually sort of true!**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis#Birds) It's rare, but birds including domestic turkeys and chickens can self-fertilize their eggs. Usually they die before hatching, but sometimes they do hatch non-sterile birds without any help from a male!

If you buy farm-fresh eggs every once in awhile you'll get an egg with a chicken embryo even if the hens had no access to roosters. Commercial egg producers check for and discard eggs with embryos. | Dwarf fortress player, thinks everything reproduces by spores | I got an opossum doing the same thing in my yard at night too. He's pretty chill. I just feed him meal worms and apples so he chills out on the digging. I'm pretty sure he's half domesticated at this point. My bulldogs are cool with him also. | you did the right thing, hope the cat was alright though | Fuck that guy! Cats aren't opposums. Both are super cute though. | It was skunks tearing up his lawn more likely, also, they eat grubs. Too bad he didn‚Äôt end up with a skunk in a trap, sounds like he could use a good spray. | It sounds like he was actually going for the cat if he was that upset about you letting out an obvious cat... makes more sense than not recognizing that it was one. | I had a crazy neighbor who used those to tap neighborhood cats and take them multiple cities over to dump. I lost a cat I loved when I was a kid to that ass hole. Thank you for saving that cat and the owners! I'm still so angry at that guy even though he passed away about 10 years ago. | If I had that problem, I would treat the lawn to kill the grubs. If it isn't this opossum another will come along. Traps are a last resort. I've only even thought of getting one when I saw a whistlepig in my yard. But he moved along before I bought the trap. | Who let the cat out? | Yeah fuck that guy! I love possums and cats. I hate anybody treating any animal shitty. | Yeah.  That guy was trapping animals to torture.

There was no ""possum"". | The other guy was right, housecats are not to roam freely. | Fuck that guy | ME TOO!! | The cat's the one that belongs in the trap. | You're a cat burglar | That‚Äôs methed up üòÇüíÄ | Okay but it *should* be lol | That sounds really cute though. I know it isn‚Äôt true. But it‚Äôs a cute line of thinking. | It's like a (ahem) ""pair of keets.""

But he hadn't confused it with Kansas either. There was Arkansas, Ar-kansas, and Kansas. | Spread them on your toast, it‚Äôs marmolade.¬† | Marmoset, I choose you! | Bullshit | And then she sued the store for damages, right? | And here I thought I was being embarrasing for tripping over my own feet after saying bye to a cashier lol! | Love that exit | Sounds like day drinking. At least it makes for a great story, especially the part where she ripped her car up trying to make a cinematic exit. | Reminds me of a conversation I had with a grown man in his 60s where he told me that white people are not native to Earth, and that they landed here in UFOs hundreds of years ago to live with all the other races, who evolved here on Earth. I really really wish I was making this up. | It sounds like she was a member of the Nation of Islam (not actual Islam the religion, a different group entirely)

I‚Äôm not super versed in their beliefs but I know they believe white people were created by an evil scientist and Muhammad is going to return on a spaceship or something | I had to gently teach a 70 year old man that Britain, an island, is the tip of a long column of rock reaching all the way to the ocean floor. | i mean it is believed that humans originated in africa but that is a crazy take on that information | I remember, years and years ago, Representative Hank Johnson was concerned about Guam getting too many people on it and flipping over because it was top heavy.

I remember it was mocked pretty heavily when it happened (around 2010) | > rice rascal

LOL | I once had an argument with a man who was insistent that the Middle East was actually in Africa and that they moved it so that Jesus wouldn‚Äôt be Black.
I‚Äôm very curious how a conversation between the two of them would go. | What a ridiculous person, but rice rascal gave me a good chuckle. Gave me some stupid image of the Little Rascals, only Chinese. What a stupid insult. Sorry if she cut you with that one. | Africans eat rice too lol. | Like what's next, you don't fuck with Pangaea?

She like, ""Lets change the subject""

Okay (This bitch don't know about Pangaea) | > and any humans that weren't African were gross malformations of genetics that the glorious people of Africa kicked out for being bad genetic code

Well ... this part is at least plausible. Though pretty racist. | I‚Äôm mixed race and my white grandmother was racist, but somehow accepted me and my mother, while simultaneously telling me that n-word babies are born white and turn dark after the first three months‚Ä¶ also told me that she once saw a mixed baby that had STRIPES as its skin tone. These weird ass people who come up with this dumbass shit, I swear | Glad to hear Yakub's lies don't work on her | Oh God NOI and Hoteps and Black Israelites and others of that ilk have rotted out people's brains. | Yakub | Wakanda forever! | Is this some kind of reversed theory of aryan people thing? | You‚Äôre a Filipino who can‚Äôt spell Filipino. Interesting. | Oh, dear. She's white, isn't she? | > I swear to God

Which God? Because gods are made-up, too, you know? Just like the floating Africa. | > a woman that thought Africa was the center of the earth

Wait ... why is Africa not the center? Depending on how you frame the map, every point on the globe is the center of the earth. | I was a 911 operator and once had a guy call who was crying and freaking out because his girlfriend was bleeding to death. Of course this is serious and medical got rolling until we (the ambulance dispatcher was patched in too) could hear the girlfriend in the background telling him to knock it off. She was on her period. He just wailed into the phone that it wasn‚Äôt normal. She was bleeding to death. She finally got the phone away from him and was super cool. She said she‚Äôd explain it to him. That made us all laugh for a while | To be fair to him, most young men have no idea about female anatomy aside from what is immediately obvious. | He sounds frustratingly stupid | It‚Äôs bonkers how poorly educated some men are about women‚Äôs reproductive organs in western countries. There is absolutely no excuse for this level of ignorance in $CURRENT_YEAR. | He‚Äôs a right-wing politician now, right? | I would really like to know what he thinks about the fact that women start their periods around 10-12 years old and have one every month. Does he think 10 year olds are all having sex once a month? WTF | If it's in the US they don't teach males about the female body or anything else that some of the most (how do I say this) ""pude leaning"" people find offensive.

Yikes. | Most schools only teach female anatomy to girls (assuming they teach it at all) | so how‚Äôd you get the frank above the beans? | This is why teaching men the basics of female anatomy is so important. | Wow. Can't believe you met a senator | People don‚Äôt know that the vulva exists. They call all vagina | Ok but this has to mean something either about her health or how rough he is right? Doesn't this suggest he makes her bleed every time they have sex for him to genuinely believe that? That sounds absolutely terrible. That is unless they happen to only have sex when she's on her period. | Quakers and Puritans cast long shadows onto the American education system. This is the outcome of that.

Break the cycle kids, don't raise your children to be foolish enough to believe in magical sky creatures that hate your genitals. | And THESE are the idiots who will vote and make reproductive choices for women. | Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said, ""At the crest of the labia."" What does that mean? What does the female vagina look like? | *current boyfriend*? Or ex-boyfriend? | Please no | Id bet that even if his school had the most instructional sex ed class it wouldn't have mattered. His elevator doesn't go to the top, that's for sure! | Some people are astounding, in that I wonder how they are still getting by with so little knowledge or so much misinformation. | We need comprehensive sexual education. This is just ridiculous. | I grew up in the regressive south under mostly baptist people and I knew this very basic anatomy lesson before (if I were a woman) I would have gotten my first period.

Where the fuck do these people grow up? It's insane to not know basic facts of life. | I hope you didn't even try explaining the vulva. That dude would have been down there with a headlamp and a map.. | Geez, I hope he never found one. | 50 bucks says he doesn't know what a clitoris is either | My sympathies. Is he better now? | My brother is the same way and he‚Äôs 32. He intentionally remains ignorant of the female anatomy so the other day I had to explain to him what a period was. It‚Äôs even scarier because he just got married (to a woman). | Here in Ohio, my school got abridged abstinence, and puberty talks rolled into one, split by gender.  The gym teacher skipped anything that made him feel uncomfortable and ignored any questions he did not like.  Yes, more than 10 girls got pregnant from my class.  That said, I could totally see a guy being confused by women in general.  I spent way too long with certain misconceptions because I assumed women and sex must be similar to the explanation of how cattle do it.  My dad never gave me the birds and the bees per se, but instead, the ins and outs of picking good stock, good bulls, and how it goes from there. | Almost no men have any idea about female anatomy.  Hell most of us don't even have a solid grasp of our own anatomies.  His daddy likely had no idea either and his mommy probably couldn't even talk about that kind of thing with a doctor. | Hey, that‚Äôs Congressman Idiot to you | r/badwomensanatomy | Reminds me of that one instagram account, wheredoesthepeecomeout, where a guy claimed that pee came out of the blood stream. 

Spoiler, it does come FROM there, but it'd be very concerning if that's where it came OUT. | If only he was a rare case...

The day I know more dudes than not who know the exact meaning of the words ""cervix"", ""uterus"", ""clitoris"" and ""vagina"" is the day I'll start dating a conservative. 

(See? Not even a high bar. Didn't even include follicles.) | Yes, vagina is the same as the uterus in the same way as the penis is the same as the bladder. ^/s | I lucked out as a kid.  I grew up in a house filled with books.  At 13, my mother bought ‚ÄùThe Joy of Sex‚Äù and tucked it discreetly away on a top shelf in the corner where I would find it immediately.

I was a budding artist, so dad got me a library card to the biggest library in Houston and told me the best way to accurately draw people was to study other artists and anatomy.  I found Romantic Realism and Gray‚Äôs Anatomy about the same time.

I had discovered that women had a vagina and urethra by the time I was 16/17.  But I was too embarrassed to say anything about that until after I married at 25. | I went to a high school with a health class where one day was a *divorce attorney* coming in and telling us all how much child support she wins for her clients. I have a wife and two kids and I still have to google everything related to reproduction. | Idk, they really didn‚Äôt teach us much about the menstrual cycle when I went through health class. Honesty, my health class was more about telling us guys to keep our dicks in our pants and don‚Äôt do drugs. They did go into mental health a little bit which was nice I guess. | That proves that he knows nothing about vaginas or anything at all wtf | He's to stupid to deserve an explanation | You have no clue how common this is with men. Part of why the ""can't find the clitoris"" memes annoy me. | What state does he represent in the Senate? | I think he‚Äôs stuck on the virgin/hymen thing. That a virgin will bleed after sex while a non-virgin won‚Äôt. He seems to not understand why that happens but instead sees blood as meaning sex happened and no blood = no sex.

I‚Äôm guessing he has a non-western background? | To be fair how many women constantly refer to their labia as their vagina these days? Way too many.

Edit to fix autocucumber typo. | The amount of women who don‚Äôt understand boners are completely involuntary and uncontrollable is absolutely shocking as well. It‚Äôs mind blowing there‚Äôs so many idiots just making their way through life. Somehow equating periods to cheating, and something that happens to literal babies is under mens control is absolutely baffling to me. | I'm constantly appalled at how many grown-ass *women* think they have hair on their vaginas. | It seems to be across the board. I've had many discussions with women who think if a male has an erection it means he's turned on, and wants sex. | While he's clearly ignorant and uneducated about women's bodies, he might be making a kind of logical leap here. Some women tend to get horny just before the period starts. He may have mixed up a correlation with a causation. 

Still dumb as hell though. | I was in biology class freshman year and there was a lady (had to be around 27+) that had to bring her two children (5-7) with her. In class the teacher had to tell her that a male balls is called testicles and a cock is informal word for penis. | >""I thought vagina was the word for how it looks on the outside""

>and that's also how I found out (it became increasingly obvious with each new sentence) that this guy is a total idiot who doesn't know anything about the female reproductive system or anatomy

To be fair, a LARGE percentage of women are equally clueless about this terminology. They think ""vagina"" means the whole shebang, not realizing the vagina is only the internal passage, that the external portions are properly the ""vulva"". | To be fair, I've kickstarted my wife's period a few times that way.

Neither of them won the argument, it just petered off in the end. I thought the fish kid was joking at first, and then as I realized he was serious, my brain just kind of short circuited and my jaw fell open and I was speechless. I think that was the first time I realized that some people are really stupid. | For me it was that brown ducks are female and the more colorful ducks are male. I was in my 30s. | Are you younger than duck hunt? | in your defense, some can‚Äôt | I distinctly remember one of my elementary school teachers reading a book to us that had a conversation between a duck and some other kind of bird.  The other bird asked the duck something along the lines of ""How can you call yourself a bird when you can't fly?"" | In Germany we have a saying:

Leaning in close I inspected it for signs of a tick. Didn't appear tick-like. So I prodded it, poked the area, pulled at it, but nothing happened. My cat wasn't distressed and he wasn't showing signs of pain, but I was concerned.

So I take some photos and email them to the vet. I explain in great detail what appears to be a dirty skin tag which showed up out of nowhere. Although the cat is in good health, I'm concerned it could be a tick or something else. 

The vet called the next day to say, 'the black thing on your cat's belly is a nipple. Sometimes they're black. Please stop trying to pull it off. Your cat is fine.'

Not only do male cats he nips. They can also be multicoloured. | ""ma'am doesn't your husband have nipples"" | It‚Äôs pretty common for people to bring their male dogs to the vet for ‚Äúgrowths‚Äù or ‚Äútick removal‚Äù and they have to explain they‚Äôre just the nipples.

I told him the theory of relativity could be tested on earth with particle accelerators and he said the particle accelerators on earth were put here by demons and that every year they have an annual demon worshipping ceremony at the accelerators.

She kept looking at 2-gallon pitchers, but it was taking a *long* time for her to decide, so I asked her what was wrong.

The problem was that she was looking for a ""small 2-gallon pitcher"" because the big ones were too heavy and hurt her wrist, but it still *had* to be 2 gallons because she didn't want to be making a new batch all the time when it ran out.

Her mind was fucking blown when I explained to her that most of the weight of the pitcher was from the tea inside, and a full 2-gallon pitcher was going to be heavy no matter what. And then even *more* blown when I suggested instead that she could use two 1-gallon pitchers.

At least at that point, she was reasonable and realized it was a good idea and didn't argue with me.

*Unlike* the time we went to the grocery store together and she was searching and searching for a ""buy one get one free"" sale on frozen peas she'd clipped a coupon for, but couldn't find it because they were sold out or something.

When I pointed this out, she adamantly REFUSED to accept that 60% off was a better deal than ""buy one get one free"". | I once had an argument with my ex about how pointless it was for them to keep buying the more expensive biodegradable (or compostable?

We learned about the area of a triangle.

You multiply the base by the height, then divide the answer by two.

There were multiple examples, which we worked through.

So, a triangle with base 16cm, height 7cm is 7 x 16‚Ä¶ um what?? You needed a calculator for each one and it took ages!

But, if you do the divide by two up front it‚Äôs way easier. Half of 16 is 8. So 8 x 7 = 56. Easy.

I ran through the whole test in a couple of minutes with this trick while everyone tapped their calculators.

Got yelled at for ‚Äúdoing it wrong‚Äù because ‚Äúyou have to divide both numbers by two‚Äù.

I could not explain to the teacher why you only divide one of the numbers by two. They just‚Ä¶ would not comprehend it. That was the day I learned that it was possible for teachers to be incredibly dumb. | And if the entire set adds up to 9, it's divisible by 9 | Honestly, was helping my 5th grade daughter with math and I just learned this about 3s today. Blew my mind | I struggled with math as a kid because, as this substitute teacher demonstrated, we're so often taught in the U.S. to memorize rather than understand. | Digital roots (or, functionally, modulo 9), is what makes this true. If you add up the digits and keep paring it down and the number is a multiple of 3, you're good. 

12468= 1+2+4+6+8=21, 2+2=3, the number is divisible by 3 but not by 9. | what is this witchcraft. i was not told there would be math. | Didn't know people learned division this way, kind of a neat idea. I've always just did them as reverse multiplication because I was sick the week we learned about it in elementary. When I got older it was easier to just solve it with fractions though. | Does this only work with values over 3 digits, or perhaps it's only the case that it's true for a subset of numbers divisible by 4? 24, 36, and 60 are examples where the value is divisible by 4, but the rule does not apply. | There are many tricks like this

1. Last 2 numbers divisible by 4 means number is divisible by 4.
2. If sum of digits adds up to a multiple of 3, then the number is a multiple of 3.
3. If last 4 digits are a multiple of 16, then whole number is a multiple of 16.
4. Last digit is 0 or 5, then number is a multiple of 5
5. There is a rule for divisibility by 11, about difference of alternate digits or something, forgot. | I use that divided by 3 one a lot. If the total of the number is divisible by 3 then so is the entire number 555 is 5+5+5=15 15 is divisible by 3 so is 555. 93201 is divisible by 3. | He did have a super power: fuck tons of money | She really should watch Toy Story.

Anyway one day the thing made a pop and died in the middle of me using it and never turned on again.

Just shows u even if u take proper care of stuff it can still break | Things don't just break tho, but there is wear and tear. | This is deeply disturbing. | Damn bro I‚Äôm pretty gullible and I still would think he‚Äôs crazy | Wouldn't people...notice if nearly all the kids they'd ever know had died? I mean, almost nobody would have any siblings. That's wild. | >  9/10

We'd be extinct as a species by now... | I have an ultra-religious aunt and when my cousin was young, she came home and told my aunt that the teacher tried to teach them some BS about dinosaurs. Even my aunt was like, ""no, those were real. You can believe those existed."" | What's their alternative theory? | I absolutely love paleontology, dinosaurs, and stuff(just look at my username lol), and people denying evolution, dinosaurs, and paleontology as somethings that are fake, irks me to no end, and is probably one of my biggest pet peeves in general. Like, theres figurative and literal mountains of evidence, and these people are too stubborn to accept the facts. | I gave my cat rare candies, and he never evolved smh my head | A general Christian, a Southern Baptist, and an Atheist take a class on 'Origins' taught by a Mormon named Charles...No, really. It was one of my college classes. I wasn't 100% sure what it was going to be about but thought the class sounded interesting so my SO and I registered. But only two other people and the teacher showed up the first day. Normally so few people would mean the class was cancelled, but the teacher had to be there anyways, so he said he'd continue if we wanted. One student noped out, but the rest of us decided to stay.

We basically watched videos about evolution, both for and against, while he napped.

The Southern Baptist girl had been homeschooled her entire life and thought the normal bs, that there is no proof of evolution, eyes are too complex to develop on their own, etc. and by the end of it was having a crisis of faith. Because obviously evolution was real, but that meant she was lied to her entire life. What else did they lie about? Did that mean she couldn't believe in her religion any more? It was kind of sad but also good that at least she was open minded enough to acknowledge reality when it's laid out in front of her. Sometimes I wonder what happened to her since the class ended. | My mother is really weird about it. She fully believes that chickens evolved from the T-Rex, yet the earth is only a few thousand years old.

When I pointed out her hypocrisy she got mad and walked away. 

This was at the Noah‚Äôs Ark thing in Kentucky where they had fucking dinosaurs on the boat XD | My religious aunt recently told me she doesn‚Äôt believe in any evolution either because ‚Äúhow can people say that humans evolved from monkeys, but monkeys still exist?‚Äù I replied ‚Äúchihuahuas evolved from wolves and wolves still exist tho?‚Äù Apparently that doesn‚Äôt count. | I was once talking to someone about vaccines and how some viruses evolve rapidly which makes them hard/impossible to develop immunity for. Then she said ""Well, not everyone believes in evolution""  

Thats when I hit em with ""Thats fine, this isnt faith based"" | Well if evolution is real why do we still have monkeys?

/s | Well, it is *just a theory* after all...

Scientific definition of theory: a well-substantiated explanation of an aspect of the natural world that can incorporate laws, hypotheses and facts. | I had a coworker ""prove"" evolution is false by saying, ""A fish doesn't just say 'I'm going to become a man!'""

What? | ""if evolution isn't real why do you get a labradoodle when you breed a poodle and a Labrador?"" | Even the strongly religious accept evolution. Just not the strongly religious who are also supremely uneducated. | ""There's no way we came from monkeys""

or the other fun common alternative:

""Then why are there still monkeys"" | Now I gotta ask this to my local dumbass. Too bad he doesnt want to talk to me after I called him out for being narcicistic, I'd love to hear his awnser to this. | Strongly brainless üí™ | I know a local chess master who thinks this.¬† | Same here, but they're _extremely_ religious, used to be in a Christian cult, and thinks the earth is about 4,000 years old. Sigh. | I tried to convince my eight year old that giraffes didn't evolve to have long necks. Chuck Norris gave an upper cut to horse. | The vice president of the confederacy Alexander Stephens, used the Bible and Darwinism as a reason that people with dark colored skin were inferior to people with light colored skin. These are highly religious people using Darwinism to seal their argument; humans evolved in such a way as to have dominion over other humans who look different. | Wut.

I could understand arguing we did not all evolve from a common ancestor 14 billion years ago but to say that all evolution doesn't exist is wild. You literally can see it in real time. | Can you define evolution? Many people have no problem with variations of a species. But there's no evidence of a species changing so much that it becomes an entirely different species. | To be fair evolution is a theory‚Ä¶but I gotta believe close to 100% of scientists believe it | its a theory buddy | I am a left wing atheist (culturally Jewish). When I got my learners permit my sister, father, and I decided to go to the creationist museum in Kentucky. Even they believe dinosaurs are real. | Did they look really un-evolved? You know, sloping forehead, eyes too close together, dragging knuckles. . . . | Stop talking to my mum | My friend had an interesting meeting with a young-earth creationist that asserted the Earth was 1,600 years old. Biblical literalist, but I wonder if he was just holding some years back to bargain with. | Mormon | Carl Everett? | A Baptist? I went to a Baptist High School in Texas, and that was literally in our biology textbooks. | In my late twenties, my office full of gen Xers thought I was delusional when I was talking about narwhals being real. I had to prove it to them it wasn‚Äôt a mythical creature. | The narwhal bacons at midnight. | This is a really common one. | NGL I didn't think they were real either until I was perusing through a wildlife catalog and low and behold there they were. I was 29 I believe. | I guess if you have trouble concentrating you might learn something there‚Ä¶ | That being said, someone that dumb probably has people who cheat on them so they can have actual conversations | I love you. | I was literally just walking down the sidewalk and I tripped and it went in bro. Stop overreacting. | Difference between delusion and stupid | Hopefully you're doing better | MTV had an entire ad campaign about safe sex ""it's not an accident"" with funny skits of people having sex accidentally. | I tripped and stuck my dick in your wife. It was an accident | What if you date twins? | Did he never look at a map? Or watch porn? Or get the sex talk from anyone in his life? | Perhaps he was thinking of Catalonia, which Barcelona is the Capital of, and which tried to become an independent country recently. (The Spanish Government has been trying very hard to stop this.) | I've seen that with depression. ""If you just smile constantly and never stop you can't be depressed."" | I have heard stuff similar to this before. I have theorized that people that believe this have themselves felt mild symptoms of depression/anxiety and to cope keep busy. Since it was only minor feelings of anxiety/depression and not a full on disorder they either just endure the symptoms with minor impact on their life or they come and go.  So these people, who may actually need some help themselves, think that what they experienced is all the worse it gets and think lesser of those those that struggle with what they got through. Not accounting for the possibility that others are experiencing something other than exactly what they have. | cancer and aids is also caused by laziness. i mean, i keep busy and i don‚Äôt have either so | I had a girlfriend that told me when depressed I should just ""snap out of it"" I tried to explain that was like asking her to just stop having her period and she couldn't understand it. | I‚Äôm confused by this. Are you saying that you believe children dont have to consent to being hugged? | [deleted] | I babysat for a father who didn't want a tampon to take his daughter's virginity. I'm paraphrasing, but that's ultimately the issue he had with his daughter using tampons. 

I believe we brushed on the subject of tampons being pleasurable as well. | Love the last paragraph. | I had the same kind of conversation, except that I am a man and she is a woman.

She argued that she had ""anemia"" because she was on her periods. I tried to explain to her what is anemia and she replied that she still loses blood - which is still not what means anemia, but she believed it is - so I then explained that she is not ""losing"" blood as if she cut with a knife.

She replied by explaining, to sum it up, that a woman's body during her periods just leaks blood, like the dam opened and blood flowed out of her body directly from veins and arteries, which is what is anemia.

She was 20 years old at that time. | I've had the same argument. I used my credit card monthly, and pay the complete amount off monthly. My credit score is 810. I don't spend much money, as I live below poverty level, but even spending small amounts and paying it off monthly raises my credit score. My sister keeps telling me that I should only make partial payments. | My father told me to get good credit you have to max the credit card out but pay 5% over the minimum payment. He said most people don't know about the extra 5% part, which is why they don't have good credit. | US credit system is wild.

I don't even have a credit card, and when applied for a mortgage, the bank just said ""Great, not a penny of debt in your name, and no credit cards. You'll get better terms as the risks with you not being able to pay back the loan are smaller"" | I‚Äôd argue that credit utilization doesn‚Äôt matter as much as you think, but obviously not paying your balance in full even once is devastating, let alone *every* time üíÄ | I've heard from someone in finance that you should keep it around 30%? | Honestly I have adhd but I don‚Äôt think it is what people think it is.   After doing a college paper on advertising agencies targeting children it was kind of crystal clear what happened.   The advertisers never marketed directly to children in the past bc the thought was you advertise directly to the wallets.   In the late 70‚Äôs early 80‚Äôs they realized if you advertise to kids they will bug their parents enough to get the toy or candy whatever it is.  The results were better than advertising to parents kids are an easy sell.  They immediately started targeting children aggressively and the main company used the slogan ‚Äúyour goal is to steal kids attention‚Äù if you look at commercials from the 80‚Äôs it becomes clear they went overboard bright colors, yelling, lots of action in very quick bursts.  Micro machine guy is a great example.  Then came the tv programs bc the advertisers needed more tv time. Cartoons exploded the length of cartoons and the screen time per frame were incredibly short compared to any other show.  It didn‚Äôt just stay on tv they completely re worked grocery stores to target certain kids based on their eye height.  Packaging became bright colors neon on everything.

My conclusion was adhd is so massive bc due to conditioning from advertisers.  Having a long attention span seems to be more rare than  in kids starting in the 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs.  And I don‚Äôt think adhd meds are a decent fix there‚Äôs a trade off I don‚Äôt think Is worth it in developing  brains.  Further more after I did that paper the guy who came up with the diagnosis of adhd apparently regretted coming up with the disorder, there‚Äôs reports that on his deathbed he said it was bullshit and it was his biggest mistake. (I‚Äôll take that as hearsay but there‚Äôs really no motive to make it up there‚Äôs a lot of motive to not report it though) 

So overall yeah I think adhd is real in the sense that it was cause and effect of advertisers but you‚Äôre teacher is somewhat right it‚Äôs not a tangible thing. I know my attention span is wild but I think it makes me more creative.  It‚Äôs not wrong it‚Äôs not a disorder. I‚Äôm glad my mom opted me out of taking meds.  When I got older I made the choice myself.

That‚Äôs just my two cents my ethics teacher agreed which was surprising.  I‚Äôm not hard lining the topic I‚Äôm still a bit agnostic either way I just see think the correlation is a bit compelling. | > ‚ÄúBeing gay‚Äù wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúinvented‚Äù in the 70s.

Using the term gay to describe homosexuals did originate in the 70s. 

So, from a certain point of view, Obi-wan was right. | As an engineer i have programmed solar trackers and had to go through the relatively straightforward equations behind how they work, it took me like 20 minutes to really digest. It made me realize that anyone who is a flat earther either has to be too dumb/unwell to be able to understand why they are wrong, or so self absorbed that no amount of logic will matter. Either way arguments achieve nothing. | my father converted into a flat earther during the pandemic.  

the basis of his conversion is extreme narcissism which manifests as a belief that he is so smart, so perceptive, so far above other humans intellectually that flat earth is something that only elites like him can realize and demonstrate.

yes he also believes that vaccines are a fraud, that covid was not real, that 5G 'radiation' is what is making people sick when they get sick with covid ( or any other ailment tbh )

He believes that I am an idiot so he doesn't accept rebuttals from me or even a discussion, he just spams me with flat earth videos and memes and demands I acknowledge them as true, when I do not, he accuses me of being one of 'them'. | I've heard parents of autistic kids say they were progressing normally when all of the sudden they hit a wall and something happens. I would not be surprised if there is something that turns normal functioning adults into blithering morons around 40. | I clean up crime scenes for a living. You wouldn't believe (or maybe you would) how many people will duck under police tape and walk through brains and blood as I'm there in a full Tyvek suit and full face respirator. | Were you talking to Terrance Howard? | On an unrelated topic, water is simultaneously wet and dry. It depends on whether you're looking at the macro or micro scale | r/TechnicallyCorrect | What did he think? | Even if it was all one country, that'd be like you telling someone you lived in New York for awhile, and they ask how it was like living in Chicago. | Wait... what? Really?!? | Leased by the UK from China, the lease was up so they gave it back | In high school I knew a girl who thought that China was a state (in the sense that Florida is a *state*) of Europe. She was the ultimate ditz. | I‚Äôm sorry???? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ | 5:30 *is* unreasonably early, though. You'd better have a damn good reason for starting the shift so early. | Tell him to lay off the Fallout DLCs | I worked Valleyfair and the amount of people that were shocked that humans shrink a little in height throughout the day due to disc compression... No your child can't ride now, but could 4 hrs ago. I'm sorry but I'm not risking their life. | Come on. This one is dumb unless they are wearing platform shoes. The slides are based on weight and height. Missing a cm on a shoe really doesn't matter. You're just being an asshole. | Damn if that were true I'd be volunteering for jury duty üòÇ no charge group therapy and I'm excused from work? Sign me up! | He's probably not had to do it much if he's 19. He just seems uninformed. | ..... Wut | To be fair, we *do* talk about our feelings in jury duty! Most of those feelings are boredom, a general sense of uselessness, frustration with government questionnaires, and annoyance over losing half a day's wages. | what is jury duty? (i'm also 19, and not from the US) | [Related story](https://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html)

Love that guy | Was he from Ohio?  A lot of Ohioans write a lot as alot.  I did have an English professor in college who would randomly have another teacher interrupt class to argue if it was regional slang or poor education.  I found it enjoyable to have two grown teachers get into the same argument constantly.  One saw the open door and saw it as a reason to have the same argument again. | r/alot | I work with a guy like this but he is an 'audiophile' and considers himself an electronics expert when in reality he has a basic and rudimentary understanding of how electricity works and a very poor understanding of how digital devices work.

He believes game consoles are obviously superior to all PCs because game consoles were 'designed for gaming' while PCs were designed for 'computing'.

he also told me that he could 'tune' his home stereo by TURNING the screws that mount his electrical outlet to the outlet box.  When he said this to me.........I responded that he really should have an electrician come out to check out his homes wiring but he laughed at me and insisted I 'try it out' and that turning the screws that mounted the electrical outlet to the outlet box was a legitimate way of 'tuning' his home stereo. | When I'm compiling software, I have two PCs that run at 100% for hours at a time without throttling.  Neither have damaged themselves and I would never buy one made by a manufacturer that is trying to pretend that throttling is an acceptable alternative to cooling. | If your cooling solution is adequate, you can run at 100% almost indefinitely. It does shorten the lifespan of your parts in much the same way as overlooking, but it's not inevitable that it'll hit a thermal shutdown if you have a good cooling setup. | Oh dang I would have thought this too. Are you saying if two people tie for first place, there‚Äôs no one in second and the other person gets third? | > He felt that if the two people ahead of you tied for first, that meant you were second.

that *is* how it works for most competitions. including the Olympics. if the 1st place time is held by 2 people, the 2nd place time goes to the third person across the finish line. | I mean, if the top two people tie then  usually the next person does indeed get second place. Like if two Olympians tied for first, the next best person would get second and the person after that would get third, even though they‚Äôre four people. Placements in competitions aren‚Äôt about the number of people who place, they‚Äôre about the scores they place at. | One more reason I'm glad I played video games growing up. ""rots your brain"" my ass. I can't even begin to tell you how much useful stuff I've learned from video games. | The terms ‚Äúfirst runner up‚Äù and ‚Äúsecond runner up‚Äù probably scrambled his brain. | He was wrong, but that's just a matter of definition/convention, not logic.  We could have decided to define the position after a first place tie as second place, so it's not totally dumb. | Yikes! I‚Äôm so happy that Raspberry ended that toxic nonsense!! I‚Äôm sure her and Acorn are living their best lives!! I hope Apple gets the help he needs before he does himself in or someone else. | I have had to tell grown ass men that women are not their emotional support animals. Stop trauma dumping and start maturing. It always turns me into the bad guy but I'll continue doing it. | Yeah, Apple sounds like the kind of guy who's going to crash and die in a car vehicle sometime soon, I just hope he doesn't kill/injure any innocent people when he does it. 

To try and be an optimist, it would be great if something that doesn't involve serious harm to an innocent person is an eye-opener for him, and he turns his life around. But realistically, he's probably going to end up a bloody mess against a tree, while a vehicle burns in pieces around him. And I doubt anyone's really going to miss him.

Sorry you had the displeasure of dealing with this dude. | Wtf is wrong with men sometimes | Red delicious? | Half the time it's out in the day light. HALF the time. People just don't look up. | Um...I actually didn't know dogs couldn't eat grapes until like a year ago when I was looking up safe foods for my parrot! 

I'd tried to feed a grape to my SOs beagle and she's a little snooty about veggies/fruits so she didn't eat it thank fuck. I read they are toxic to dogs like a week later. I had all kinds of pets as a kid including several dogs and I can't believe I didn't know that! I was looking for stuff I could feed my bird AND the dog like purreed pumpkin (good for both) and stumbled across the grape thing. 

I also recently found out some dogs can be sensitive to meat or meat fat! There was an AITA post where this guys dog dies and he blames his friend who fed the dog a meatball. Iirc it was a Yorkie? But whatever it was, the breed is sensitive to meat or excessive fats and that dog was particularly sensitive (while OPs other dogs of the same breed were not). Not to mention that a meatball can contain onions and garlic or other things a poisonous to a dog. Here I am giving the beagle lumps of fat from our steaks and offering her grapes...woops... | Yes, *but* they're only *slightly* poisonous to dogs.

Most dogs will be just fine with a *few* grapes, and only have problems if you feed them a lot of grapes in a short amount of time.

Still, though, best to avoid it, just to be safe. | As a cashier, I once tried telling someone I didn't want to pour out his drink in my trash can because it was pretty much full up and would like spill. He just went over and dumped into another almost-full can and, what do you know, it spilled over. | Need to ask: is there a specific reason only water could be allowed? 

Is it just a a cheap attempt to sell more soda? | You can eat raw shrimp, like in ceviche or shrimp tartare. It's the citrus juice that allows it. | You really can have raw shrimp. When I was in Japan they pulled a shrimp out of the tank cut the head off and put it on my plate. I ate it while it was still moving. 100% raw and kind of alive? | I tried to explain to a guy that humans and dinosaurs didn't live at the same time. He refused to believe me because he saw it on The Flintstones. | Depends on whether or not you consider 65,000 to be ""a few""... | ( I had to explain it to a grown man, mind you) | I personally think it's hilarious that people don't understand eggs are chicken periods. I like bringing it up lol | Out of a willingness to believe the best in people I wanted to believe Shawarma was a word meaning ""wrapped"" or something of the sort. 

It does not. It refers to the way the meat is cooked. That person is in fact just an idiot. | Hell, even every individual flip of a coin is a 50/50 chance. You can hit tails 100 times in a row, and it's still a 50/50 probability. I learned that the hard way playing roulette like 20 years ago. Red hit like 18 times in a row or something like that. | Lots of people have a shockingly loose understanding of the concept of probability. I've had to explain to someone that a forecast stating there's a 90% probability of rain wasn't ""wrong"" if it doesn't rain that day, or that a 20% chance of something doesn't mean it definitely won't happen because it's less than 50/50. | Some people will do or say anything to justify their actions, even if it means forcing themselves into deep denial so it becomes a new reality for them.  Sorry you had to go thru that.  

My X wife didn't understand many things like what basic boundaries are or should be with male friends your husband doesn't like for many reasons. | You were on a break | One of my friends and his wife got ""unofficially divorced"", they still live together and are legally married (he wants the tax advantages of it and she said she need shis health insurance) and the idea is they stay married until one of them gets married to someone else. For social purposes, they still act married in the sense that if one of them goes to an event where you'd be expected to bring a spouse/significant other, they still go.

I mean, they both consider themselves single and both say the other one can date/fuck whoever they want. But that has got to be a fucking hard thing to make someone else believe. ""Oh yeah, I technically have a wife, but she's fine with us banging."" | What a cunt. | DAFUQ? Someone was reffing and somehow didn't know that break actions go over the shoulder, barrel down? It's literally his job to chap your ass if you ***don't*** do that. | To be fair, a lot of people don't know that the sperm can carry either the X or Y chromosome while the egg only carries X. | Oh yeah the old wives tale that the gender is decided by whether or not the woman had an orgasm | I‚Äôve had multiple conversations with adults older than myself about how it doesn‚Äôt matter AT ALL whether a man ‚Äúhas twins in the family‚Äù. It always just ends with them giving me a blank stare.

I have also had to explain the concept of identical vs fraternal twins to multiple adults.
Did NONE of y‚Äôall pay attention in intro biology??! | I had to tell a 55-year-old black woman that no, it is not the race of the father that determines the race of the child. I am mixed and her grandchildren are mixed as well. I majored in (ethnic) studies. She majored in ‚ÄúNo, you are WRONG.‚Äù | ""decide"" | What? This isn‚Äôt something that you learn alongside your abc‚Äôs. Most of us have no business knowing this so not being privy to this information is very valid. I only know about this because I‚Äôm kinda a nerd when I‚Äôm ready | It‚Äôs not yet determined which person determines the sex of the child other than it being random chance, but if it‚Äôs either, it‚Äôs probably more likely to be the woman. Sperm cells carrying Y chromosomes may be smaller and faster than X carrying sperm cells and there may be vaginal/uterine conditions that favour the one over the other. | I like to think my eggs have a say in choosing which sperm, and thereby the gender, but that‚Äôs much more optimistic thinking than anything I‚Äôve ever bothered to base in science. | It sounds like the man makes a conscious choice rather than it being an. X or y sperm | I can understand this one, it takes an understanding of science to get. | I used to think that,  but it was just a phase. | To be fair, phase transitions, specific heat, pV=nRT, etc. are taught in chemistry and not in physics. | Eh... depends how you define 'chemical change'.

In liquid water, individual water molecules form into temporary chains of molecules because they're polar -- the positive side of one molecule is attracted to the negative side of another. Breaking these weak bonds between molecules is literally what evaporation does. Once the bond is broken, the individual molecule is no longer connected and can now float freely as water vapor. If the free-floating molecules in water vapor cool down enough, they'll start moving slowly enough to join back together again ... and that's condensation.

The chemical formula doesn't change, and the individual molecules don't change ... but the interaction between molecules *does* change, and it very much is a 'chemical' process. | And the best way?
I struggle | Ok, hear me out;

It's 6am, i just fell asleep at 2am, and i work at 7 and gotta take my oldest son to school on the way.
I get in the shower. Wash hair, wash face, use conditioner,  wash rest of me.....

You have no idea how many times I've been far too tired to balance and washing my feet ends in hitting my head on the wall or the spigot stabbing me as I land.....
The tops of both feet and between toes get washed daily. But tired me is tired of getting beaten up by the shower. Awake me can deal with feet bottoms when they're doing the scrubbing. | Yeah I don't do this,  I just let the soap from the rest of my body wash over them. | Copper bracelets stop nothing except a small area on your wrist poorly.  That said, copper is naturally deadly to most bacteria.  The Amish vet/doctor/dentist/butcher (he does a lot) likes to use copper tools because the stitches are less likely to get infected and has a small copper rod he rubs after he washes his hands. | What did they think the closest star was? | Was she local? Most of the world would measure that in ml. I had no concept of ounces until I started traveling to the US regularly. | I once had the opposite conversation. Was at a restaurant and ordered a beer. The waitress asked ""Tall or wide?"", I asked ""How big are they?"". She answered ""Well, the tall is like a large and the wide is like a small"". I clarified and said ""Oh, I meant like units. How much liquid do they hold? Like ounces or milliliters or ..."". She got confused and said ""......Units? I don't think our glasses do that""

Then I sighed and said ""Nevermind, I'll just have a water. Use whatever glass youd like"" (Water was free, beer wasnt) | I mean ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | Well, why do they come in sizes then? S-small, M-medium, and L-large? I'm going to go ask my girlfriend what size she wears. | Soap up the chest and let the soap run down, right? | What did he think? | ‚ÄúWhy do cherries cost more per pound than apples‚Äù was my very first stupid retail argument | oh the retail horror, i don‚Äôt miss that at all. My ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù was when the card processing system would go down. People would still try to swipe Ebt cards and debit cards. ‚ÄúDebit cards are like checks! It connected to my checking account!‚Äù Yes it is, but it;s still a CARD, and the card reader ***DOESN‚ÄôT WORK.*** ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs like a check! It should go through just fine!‚Äù But it‚Äôs not a check, it‚Äôs. a. ***CARD****.* It makes my blood boil just thinking about it. | Retail worker here too.

I can't believe how many times I have to explain (multiple times each week) that you need more fabric than the exact surface you measured your mattress to be if you plan to sew sheets/a duvet cover. 

Context: we can make curtains, sheets and duvet covers from the same material the customer chooses, many people want them matching. Some are convinced that sheets/covers should be cheaper and I am trying to scam them because they measured the bed surface/frame and I am charging  more fabric than that. | Except you can microwave a lot of different metals as long as they don't have sharp edges. | Had to inform my grown adult roommate that you can't microwave Styrofoam. | You can microwave metals just not all metals, and not metals with close points like forks that can make plasma. My first microwave was a hand me down that actually had a ton of metal accessories. It had built in temperature probes. No matter how far you pushed those in there was always going to be some metal exposed. | Funny enough I saw an article about this and larger pieces of metal are generally okay. Certain types and styles of spoons wouldn't effect the spoon or the microwave. However thin metals like tinfoil or gold and silver plating are what really cause damage. So when he said it's only a little bit that's probably the worst scenario.

Now the general rule is no metal in the microwave whatsoever as you'd basically need a physics degree and detailed technical breakdown of whatever metal you decided to put in there. So don't try it but I couldn't help commenting as the it's just a little comment is actually so much worse. | I mean, lots of microwaves come with steel racks | I was surprised to learn you can use aluminum foil in some microwaves. My new microwave works with aluminum foil as long as the foil doesn't touch the sides of the microwave. I'm not sure how the technology changed to allow this to work compared to microwaves when I was a kid. | When microwaves first came out they promoted how you can defrost half a pound of ground beef by wrapping half of it in foil.¬†

It works okay except when you have gaps or pointy bits, which means that people will mess up so they stopped recommending it.¬† | I didn't learn that AT middle school. I learned it in middle school when I tried to reheat a delicious Arby's sandwich. 

Set on fire really quickly. | There are exceptions | I was about 22 when I learned about metal in the microwave. It had just never come up before that. Afterward, there was a tiny hole in the glass door of the microwave, which I kept using for years afterward. | The science oven can have a little bit of metal. As a treat.¬† | I have a steel mug that I microwave often. No issues at all. It's things like foil and forks that have points that focus the elections and produce a charge large enough to spark. | My brother wasn't thinking one time, threw an old school Arby's sandwich in the microwave when it was still in that stupid foil-lined wrapper and walked away.

Came back thirty seconds later to (his description, I didn't see it) plasma ball like tendrils reaching from the foil to the top of the microwave.

It never did work right after that. | I had to explain this to a group of line cooks. Experienced line cooks. 

At least I finally understood why I had needed to make so many warranty claims on our microwave. 

(Yeah yeah ‚Äúsome microwaves‚Äù ok, but this wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúsome microwaves.‚Äù These idiots broke three of the same damn thing and didn‚Äôt put two and two together. lol) | My wife's stepfather's brother placed something in the microwave at Christmas that was covered with aluminum.  My wife noticed and told him that it's not good to do so but he insisted it was okay and he's been doing it for 30 years.  She argued with him over it for a while then finally told him to go ahead.  He did then said, see, nothing happened.  She turns off the lights and there are tiny sparks jumping all over.  ""See!"" she said.

I've replaced 6 built-in microwaves at his house over the years.  Now I know why. | Might be fine, but why chance it. | Being in the room when a coworker found out that you shouldn't microwave an egg was the highlight of the week.


On a related issue ,¬† why do ladies scream as a natural instinct, lol. | That's a valuable lesson about the photoelectric effect. | I had to explain to my boss the difference. A reason seeks to explain, an excuse wants to justify. | Had a previous bible study teacher say that to me back when I was a teen. I stopped getting lessons from her as soon as i could. | Dr. Edward Jenner created the world's first successful vaccine in 1796. So, by his logic, we've been living in the end times for over 200 years? | My mom was saying this shit as well. Her doctors told her plainly if she didn't get vaccinated and caught COVID she would absolutely die. I forced her to get vaccinated and get the booster. We had COVID twice. She didn't die, but she was really sick and she was hospitalized the first time.

Now I'm going to have to make her get vaccinated again. I think she won't argue now. | My uncle is like this too. We as a family just don‚Äôt talk to him. | Does he wear a MAGA hat? | A tiny dot that disappears after like a day? | I wash my penis and put it into clean underwear. How is touching it dirtier than touching my face or arm? | Since the Penis ist basicly always covered its very clean.
Its Not even Mad to wash your hands beforehand.
Depending on how the conversation went and If they showered recently you Just might have been in the wrong. | I've trimmed many tree over hangs working for tree services. You are correct most of the time it's just because the branches were hit by passing vehicles, but sometimes they're also cut. You usually use the scar on the trees where it was cut back and had regrowth as a reference to where to cut again. | The very idea that big government funded by our tax dollars should feed our children! Scoff! Why on earth would you want our government to care for future generations?! Crazy talk! While we're at it, screw school busses and books! 

It's a sad state these days, especially for future generations üòü | A lot of people will say they don't believe in caste systems or serf/aristocrat distinctions, then turn right around and treat retail workers and waitstaff like a toilet they've been holding it in for for days on end. | Your manager kinda sucks for giving into their bullshit demand to open the door....

People, don't accommodate the tantrums, that only encourages them more... | Thr KGB could not force the fact that I'd dated such a man out of me. | I thought you were saying they are identical and thought "" there's a fight brewing right here!"" | Same. The amount of adults who ask if mine were identical absolutely astounds me | I mean, some of the newer Disney plus content I don't think is as engaging for kids. But it's generally been kept pretty kid-friendly, for the most part. 

Still breaks my heart how episode 8 tried to force in some moral story about the company selling weapons to both sides. I don't watch Star Wars for that sort of stuff, please. | Star Wars is for 12 year olds. That doesn't mean it can't have nuanced, complex stories (sometimes) or that adults can't enjoy it, but it is ultimately intended for kids.¬† | I actually grasped fractions MUCH better after taking a job where I used a measuring tape daily. You can literally count the pieces! | Well, at least it's not 6/4 people. | Yeah this is a pretty common belief, I've spoken to healthcare professionals who think this.  Probably comes down to appeal to nature | Since moving to a red state, I've had these asinine discussions far too often. 

We need better credibility laws in media | Monkey‚Äôs  might be able to but Ape and Chimpanzees can‚Äôt ‚Ä¶they‚Äôve got to much muscle mass they sink like a stone . | Did you explain how her own period works? | Then why do they call old, rich families blue bloods? Huh? Explain that! | Honest question. Would you consider that person to be someone who had a good standard of education, because my mind is blown by that | ""Na man, You're thinking of OLD mexico, i said NEW Mexico. In the states obviously."" | lol üòÇ this cracked me up | Love that last line! It's going to be part of my repertoire now  - pen out of inküòÜ | I always get asked if my sister is older than me because she‚Äôs taller than me‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre in our 40s | Well, from the other side, I started telling people I was nearly 40 because I'm sick of being talked to like a child because I'm short. 

I think people do in fact see height as a marker for age whether they mean to or not. | I have been assumed to be older than some of my older siblings for the same reason. Multiple times. | I get the opposite. I'm 5' and half an inch. I've always been told I look young and people are often quite patronising to me as if I'm a child. I think I do look quite young for my age, but not *that* young for heaven's sake - I am in my forties. When I commented to someone that I'm often mistaken for being younger than I am, she said ""it's probably your short height."" I mean, I assumed that was the case when I was 18 and people wouldn't believe I was old enough to do certain things, but not now! | >who the fuck opens it away from the plumbing

I'll be honest. I don't open it that way, but it seems to be the more sensible way. The water spray from the nozzle is more contained on the plumbing side than on the far side. | My shower is situated so if you were to pull the curtain towards the plumbing, you would step out directly into the toilet.

My point- it depends. | I've literally never once thought this was something people had a preference about. Had to think about my long history and from what I can tell, it has nothing to do with where the plumbing is. 

I open it at the side closest to bathroom door. | I think this largely depends on the design/orientation of your bathroom. It does for me, anyway.

See, I'm super poor so I can't afford a nice place. So all the places I've lived in, the toilet is right next to the tub. Whichever side of the tub the toilet is on, is where the curtain goes when it's open. So I can get in the damn tub without fighting the curtain. | I open it away before getting in so I can turn on the water, then towards after I‚Äôm finished so it‚Äôs not in the way of me getting out. | Depends on the configuration of your bathroom really | It's dependent on what is on the outside. The point is to get the curtain out of your way, so you can exit. No one is trying to have the curtain touch their body after the shower. 

I do agree with you, though. It should be left to protect the plumbing from errant water sprays that probably never happen, but could happen. | I slide the curtain from right to left, regardless of where the plumbing is.   In my current house, that's away from the plumbing. | I do both because I have two shower curtains. I like a bit of overlap so have one coming in from each side to overlap in the middle. | [deleted] | This had to be fast food, I heard that excuse WAY too many times.

Listen, I don't care what that other location does. That's them. You want it that way? Go there, then. | Anytime I hear of this, I'm thankful for the way Australia does it.

The price is what you pay. If you see ""$5"" on the menu then that means *it will cost you $5 to buy it*. Why the heck would it matter that it's actually $4.65 + tax? | Your friend confused ""cellulose powder"" with ""sawdust"". | Cellulose powder is refined wood pulp. Your friend's words weren't exact, but s/he isn't exactly wrong. | Your friend is thinking of (cheap) grated Parmesan, which often does indeed have cellulose in it as an anti-caking agent. | Hmm, I didn't know that. Thank you for this little bit of education! | Oh no, I fear you have been pranked. Who told you this? ""Reindeer"" comes from Old Norse. ""Caribou"" comes from French. Only in North America do the two words have different meanings. We have both wild and domesticated reindeer. | To be fair, you probably did the same thing to her when you were a kid. | The way this is written it sounds like YOU think that our Sun orbits the galaxy and that our moon does not orbit Earth.......am I reading that correctly? | Yes, like eggplant is dairy. /s | This was a very common prank on newbies in the restaurant industry. ""Fill this 10gal pot with cold water, don't leave unattended coz cold water boils faster than hot!"" 

When I was a newbie, I argued til I was blue in the face and they finally told me it's a prank and I should've just gone with it. Still bitter about it lol | These are not mutually exclusive ideas... | I knew there'd be some good stuff sorting by new after 4200 comments. Couldn't you just show her it will pause after 30 seconds of just running the tooth brush without brushing? Just lay it on the table for 30s. | It's almost like people didn't notice that flu cases went way down with all those precautions. As if it worked or something. | I don't get anti-maskers. Literally any matter will block some of the matter that is coming at it. Viruses don't phase through solid objects no matter how sheer or porous a fabric is. | I just respond ""Oh, I'm extremely ugly. Trust me, EVERYONE wants me to wear this""

That uselly gets a chuckle and defuses the situation | I got so tired of listening to their bs about how the only reason people wore masks was because of propaganda. I pulled my masks that I used to combat allergies out of a drawer and made my SO start wearing them weeks before it even arrived. A disaster group I follow had some posts on it and as I watched it spread it was pretty obvious to anyone with a brain what was going to happen. Since it wasn't clear early on whether it would be airborne or not I also told him to limit going out too but it'd be best to wear a mask if he did. | Why though?  The justification was that Covid could spread asymptomatically and we need to ""care for others.""

Unfortunately that argument proves too much because it works just as much in 2024 because some people can't get the vaccine, don't have it, or are vulnerable to other diseases.

So, to invoke the ancient social blame ritual of covid.  If you don't wear a mask in public in 2024 why are you an uncaring piece of shit who wants to kill Grandma? | Public masks are so stupid tbh 

Yeah lets wear a mask when i am literally hiking deep in the forest without anyone around me | To be fair they later admitted that it offered basically no protection. Not trying to justify anything, I was in physical therapy for a dislocated knee during the pandemic and still wore a mask without issue. Also, I got covid despite wearing a mask and always using sanitizer, never touching face, etc. Thankfully I was vaccinated so it was like 12 hours of 'meh' and then I was fine. | But it is for some. Or so I've heard... from a friend... | All is good, as long as you know the [limit.](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FDwu7CD5W0AARWml.jpg&tbnid=EAtTXRO8RlYXvM&vet=1&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fmemescentrai%2Fstatus%2F1084165781020119040&docid=YZYhIzz8J-9apM&w=891&h=1024&source=sh%2Fx%2Fim%2Fm1%2F2&kgs=bbb1a09673900d4e&shem=abme%2Ctrie) | Not really it's not even night yet and I've done it about 5 times already | ""The enemy's gate is down..."" | If you want the best example of this in action, go play No Man's Sky. I very quickly learned that directions as we understand them here on Earth, means absolutely nothing in space. Very good game btw. | Oh yeah? Then why do ships in Star Trek always meet facing the same direction? | I can't help but think of this as a much more concerning version of the classic couples problem where the woman vents to the man and the man does not provide emotional support, but what he perceives to be the best solution. Your dad probably understood that there was a problem and found what he thought was the  best solution to the problem.

I'm not trying to minimize your experience or say that it was irrelevant that you were touched without your consent by someone else btw. Just trying to show what I can figure is your dad's perspective. | > better Christian than he is and I'm an atheist

There's no hate quiet like Christian love. | okay but 300km/s is only 0.07% error, whereas 186000 miles/second is 0.2% error... | Yes but when people say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs in the east wing‚Äù, or ‚Äúnorth wing of the building‚Äù, is it the eastern part of the physical building or the coordinental part of it? | Smoking while fueling with it running ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Idk wtf was wrong with the dude but me n buddy got away from that gas station real quick. | He's not *wrong* wrong about the sugar, or even wrong about fruit being high in sugar. Generally it's not problematic though with fruit because fruit is high in other important things like fiber an vitamins. Refined sugar and even high sugar ""good"" things like fruit juice can be problems though.  They don't have the offsets that natural stuff gas.

I agree he's being a dick though. You can be vegan and eat potato chips and Swedish fish and its not *good* for you. Zealous people are so difficult because their black and white thinking leaves no room for the nuances of real life | This is so crazy to me! The amount of stories I've hear about people sneaking allergens into other people's food is mind blowing. And the people who do shit to other like that are always the kind that themselves lie about allergies for attention or whatever. It's like they don't believe anyone would tell the truth because they themselves are liars | Sheesh.  You shouldn't be throwing trash out the window, even if you *could* open it. | wtf lol masters in bio | This sounds futile from the start. | this is pretty funny | Well tbh it was originally part of Virginia | I can believe it because I get it, to them that clump of cells is a person, and they want to justify controlling women. Doesn't mean I agree with them. | Murder is good m‚Äôkay amirite!? | Came here to say that. | Not only wasn‚Äôt, but still isn‚Äôt. | I agree, but that's literally an opinion that cannot be ""proven"" | My prescription prices, through insurance, vary by pharmacy. The prices at CVS and Walgreens are NOT the same for the exact same prescription. Same for Walmart. I used to fill at Walmart because they were cheaper, but their service was shit. I pay almost twice as much for one at Walgreens, exact same insurance. Nothing changed but the pharmacy.

Edit: In this case, the price varies little for a 30 day supply, but it does vary. This is from my insurance‚Äôs website. [see the difference](https://imgur.com/a/NlF74eu) | Unfortunately, that statement is misleading and potentially harmful.

Insurance companies agree to refer policyholders to certain retail pharmacies if those pharmacies agree to deeply discount their standard retail prices.  This is the purpose of insurance networks. 

Many insurance policies require the pharmacy to charge a low, flat price (a copay).  For people who pay their medical expenses through a Health Savings Account, that cost is higher - but still a lower negotiated rate than the pharmacy typically charges.  And THESE negotiated costs can vary greatly by different retail chains in the network.  Patients with HSAs should always shop their medications at various retail chains before setting up recurring refills.

If insurance covers a medication, patients will always pay less with a network pharmacy than the full retail cost the pharmacy would otherwise charge.  Without insurance limiting the prices, costs would be astronomically higher and insurance rates would increase exponentially.  Too often, people spin it as though the insurance companies are sticking it to consumers and making healthcare unaffordable, when that‚Äôs not how the system works. | I can't believe this isn't being upvoted. | Why, though? I'd just like to hear your reasoning. I know quite a few adults who can not swim. Even though swimming might be a pleasant way to spend their time, it certainly doesn't endanger them in any way. | Why so you NEED to?

I literally got on the forks of a sky track and had them put me 40 feet in the air. I dropped a hammer and a penny at the same time and of course they hit the ground at the same time. 3x.

This was a thing in my family. Several more old-school relatives insisted the one pescatarian family member was in fact a vegetarian. Their reason being that fish doesn't count as 'meat' during Lent, therefore fish is not meat. | Oh I love people like that! Lol | I didn't realize until I read an article about it, that *most* people can look at a group of up to 5 things and ""just know"" that's how many are there. My brain stops at 3! I have to count anything above that. A big chunk of my degree was learning navigation. I'm good with the theory and the why's and I can do all the complicated problems, including spherical trigonometry....as long as I have a calculator. I cannot for the life of me add a column of number in my head lol. 

To be fair, I never had a good math teacher growing up and on top of that I was often severely punished for doing poorly in math. It's a sensitive subject for me mostly because not only was I not taught well, but there was almost never positive reinforcement. On the other hand, I'm an avid reader and pretty good at English. The things others struggle with, including basics like spelling and grammar baffle me. Until I remember that they probably had the same experience reading and writing that I did with math. I KNOW I can learn math and in fact have started watching YouTube videos that have multiple ways to explain concepts, but it isn't ""natural"" for me because I was cruelly treated about it when I was young. | The same people who think the president directly controls gas prices | Jesus lol that's awful. | >Yeah having to explain to people that's now how averages work

Cheques are not debited from your account if you don't have enough money in all circumstances. Unless you have an overdraft facility set-up it will bounce.

You can pay with a cheque on a Tuesday morning with zero money in your cheque account. Tuesday afternoon transfer in the money to cover it. Tuesday night the business deposits the cheque and their bank tries to draw down the cheque which is successful.

The only thing that makes their perception make any sense is if the OT bumps you up a tax bracket and the company takes out taxes for the next bracket. It might *look* like youve made less then, because it's only coming out of the ""over"" wages which may be small on that first check where you're in that higher bracket. Or they calculate based on your OT that you may get bumped up a bracket while you actually haven't been, but in that case it all gets straightened out when you fill out your tax return.

Not saying she is right, but she may have a point. | It's not even what might be going on in the woman's life that makes ""you should smile"" offensive. It's the implication that the woman needs to change something to be more appealing to the man saying it. It's rude because it not only objectifies the woman, but puts her own feelings lower than the man's and basically says ""your job is to please me"" no matter what relationship (if any) that woman has to the man. It implies a woman is solely there to be beautiful for the man and only his opinion is important | Similar story but a $2 bill lol | Eclipses are what's cause by the earth's shadow.

There are a couple of animals with truly blue blood though. The horseshoe crab is one. They actually use their blood for something in medicine (I don't remember what rn) and their blood is blue because they don't use iron to circulate oxygen but copper as the binding agent. | I believe it is actually illegal to drive in the left lane in some states. It's passing *only* and you can get a ticket for being in that lane if you aren't actively passing someone. On top of that you can get tickets for impeding traffic if you're driving too slow. Allegedly Someone's grandma got pulled over for doing the speed limit on the 5 in California because they were getting passed by so many people.

I'm not very smart and I know the earth is round, but whenever I watch or read stuff about like Unification Theory and trying to make sense of quantum physics, I can't help but think that our understanding of gravity is flawed. It does explain what's happening on a large scale very very well, but it gets complications on the smaller scales. I think we have something still to discover that will help redefine gravity. I assume it will be similar to when we discovered atoms and then subatomic particles helped redefine what/how atoms are. | If you‚Äôre lucky enough to get within 10 feet of them before you‚Äôre shot dead maybe. | Can I come to your next family dinner if I bring popcorn alcohol and flower?

She was blaming *the girl* and I was like SHE WAS A CHILD SHE COULDN'T CONSENT. While my SOs 13 yr old daughter was also in the car. I honestly probably would have said nothing but the way the conversation was going I didn't want the 13 yr old to EVER think that she was somehow to blame for any sexual encounter she may have while she was underage. I also wanted her to understand that grooming is NOT ok and that you can be groomed while under 18 and that DOESNT make YOU the slut if you end up sleeping with the man when you're over 18. I'm not describing this conversation well, but I was absolutely infuriated that my SOs own mother would be painting a child as a whore! Especially as this is a woman who was ""dating"" an 18 year old when she was almost 30 and had a 16 year old son!

Oh honey... | Switzerland? | I did 6 years of history at school - the only things we did from 1930 to the present day were Nazi Germany and ANZAC troops (I'm Australian). We barely touched the holocaust when we did an entire term on WWII, but we also barely, if ever, mentioned Russia, Mussolini, communism, nuclear bombs, Pearl Harbor, or Japan.

We spent at least a quarter of the time on how Hitler got to power, and every lesson was the same - ""this will happen here in Australia if you don't vote for this party/oppose this policy/support this idea/join this activist group"".

That said... you should know about the Holocaust even if you DIDN'T do history at school. | Yep. Never made it to ww2 either.

As in, ‚Äúan hour sounds about right‚Ä¶but it may take you 45 min sometimes and over an hour other times.‚Äù She was convinced speed is sort of a clumsy inexact measurement. Not a definite number that has real math. | Aw see this sucks, because I‚Äôm not stupid at all, but I have dyscalculia and it‚Äôs like my brain can‚Äôt hold onto all of the numerical referents of each idea at the same time as using logic to make sense of how the numbers relate to one another.

It seems ridiculous. Then there's light speed and time dilation, and it gets even more fun. | How I'd explain it:

We are allowed to multiply anything by 1 whenever we want, so we are allowed to multiply anything by (60 minutes / 1 hour) whenever we want, because 60 minutes = 1 hour.

So if we take (60 miles / 1 hour) and multiply it by 1 (that is, by 1 hour / 60 minutes), the 60s cancel, as do the hours. And we are left with (1 mile / 1 minute). | It's easier to convert that one into fractions. If I'm going 90mph in 60 minutes, then 60/90 = 2/3 of a minute, or 40 seconds  a mile. | Easy way to do it in your head:

Going 60mph for one mile takes 60 seconds.

For 120mph, which is 2x60, it takes 60/2=30 seconds.

45 seconds is 3/4 of 60. So you'd have to go 4/3x60=80mph. | but that actually is hard to grasp | That would fry the circuits of lot of adults I know.

If there are any domesticated animals around, which is a safe bet, than you can be sure that they know that sex leads to offspring. Pretty fundamental to making sure you have enough animals around. Also, OP stated that this woman was married. Marriage implies taboos around sex, and taboos around sex imply an understanding that sex = babies. Now, your argument may be religious blinders, maybe, but sex = babies is in the bible, in Genesis no less. Eve lays with Adam and begets Cain. Hell, you get further in the only mention to abortion in the bible is a recipe for an abortificant to give to a woman who is suspected of infidelity...

Penguins were called penguins because the explorers that discovered them thought they were part of the auk/puffin family. | If you really want to blow their mind tell them there are penguins in Africa | Aww, why did you tell me that?? | Guessing that person never watched Billy Madison | I‚Äôve eaten reindeer in Norway and Finland.

They all run amok at night and the sound of their hooves can be unnerving to those who aren‚Äôt used to it. During the day, you might find them lazing out in the open. They don‚Äôt bother us, we don‚Äôt bother them. | There‚Äôs a managed herd in the Cairngorms (Scotland). I learned from them that they click when they walk. | Shit got real. | I visited Finland once and there were fairly friendly Reindeer.

Even as kids we were like wtf man. This was his explanation. | Oh my driving partner in Driver's Ed thought if the sign was on a white pole then it was optional to stop. It's so bizarre. Where does the idea come from? | I was learning to drive and we came to a Stop sign that had ""all way"" at the bottom, it happened to be one my dad regularly rolled through in our neighborhood so I told him, pretty aggressively, ""Dad! That stop sign says all way! That means you have to stop ALL THE WAY! They put that on stop signs that people run!"" He had a great time explaining to me that it means it's a 4 way stop. I'm 27 and still get shit from my family for it | When I was in drivers ed in high school, one of the kids slowed down greatly, but ultimately rolled through a stop sign. Instructor had him pull over on the country dirt road we were on.

""What was that?""

-I slowed down!

""... Ok. Ok. Hop out. I want you to go stand in the road for a second.""

Instructor gets in driver's seat, proceeds to roll the car (quite slowly don't worry) at him. Stops maybe 6 inches to a foot from him.

""Did you want me to slow down, or to stop?""

Left quite an impression on all of us. | Like the viral video ‚Äúput your smartphone in the microwave to quick charge it‚Äù | Was it an optional ticket? | Don‚Äôt all stop signs have white borders üíÄ | My 10th grade science teacher used to tell us this.

I was also told STOP is just an acronym for Slight Tap On Peddle. | Holy shit are you my ex-wife?  I've literally never heard this story anywhere else... | There are ""optional"" stop signs though, usually on private property (parking lots) there will be signs that are different looking and don't have a ""DOT"" sticker on them meaning they're not official stop signs and not policed

I put optional in quotes because if you blow one and hit someone or something then you're still almost definitely at fault | Wtf is he gay or something? | If there was no other traffic coming, you didn't need to stop | Look, we can't keep stopping at every sop, yeld, or one vay sign! | I just posted my story about this! I thought the same thing until 15ish when I was getting my permit | Did he slow down or just blow through it? | My illiterate grandpa had been taught the acronym ""Slow 'Til Others Pass"" which he said at every stop sign as he rolled through it. He couldn't spell any of those words, but he knew the first letters. | Uuuhhhh, Rooooon | What absolute bollocks. You must stop at a stop sign in the U.K., completely. In fact you will fail your driving test if you don‚Äôt, same as running a red light. However stop signs are fairly rare in the U.K., what we have far more of is Give Way signs, or Yield in American. For a give way you slow and need to be prepared to stop if your route isn‚Äôt clear or if other traffic has priority, but you don‚Äôt have to stop if the way is clear. At a stop sign you must stop, even if your way is clear. So stop signs are only used in the U.K. where they are really needed, everything else is give way. | It's true, it was A&W

I told these two adult women to check that the truck has 1/4 tank of gas and to bring it back at 1/4 tank of gas. 

They couldn't comprehend what I was asking them and finally asked me to check for them. 

I checked. It was indeed at 1/4 tank. 

They argued with me that it was not 1/4. I asked what they believed 1/4 of the gauge was.

I will dumb it down if I have to. I try not to start there, but I'm absolutely willing to go there. One of my favorite moments as a sub was explaining the distance formula: ‚àö((x1-x2)^2 +(y1-y2)^2). I had a kid come up and put random points on the board, then do the math in the formula. They saw it and memorized the formula, but then I started explaining that x1-x2 and y1-y2 are just distances across and up, respectively. 

I next drew a horizontal line from x1 to x2, and a vertical line for Y. Asking them what the distance was for X and Y, they answered, so I wrote that up on the board next to each and asked them what the shape was. ""A triangle."" ""Yeah, but what kind?"" ""A RIGHT triangle!"" When I showed them how this was just a derivative of the Pythagorean Theorem, they UNDERSTOOD why the distance formula worked and got all excited.

Sometimes the label even has it listed out in grams despite being marketed in pounds and ounces. 

It's not particularly hard to do the conversions, and most folks who cook state side use volumetric measures so they roughly never actually have to do or think about how much weight the volume is trying to approximate.

Married a white dude who came over, and that was her ticket to the USA. That much I knew. I don't know anything about religion or culture over there or what women are taught or her own personal beliefs on the matter. She never was the sit down and get to know her type of person | This is not religious bs. This is just america

Every christ nows this and if not theyre just stupid | It's likely heavy religious indoctrination. She must come from an ultra-religious traditional household that makes women feel like whores over their biological functions as well as inferior in general. | I don't know. She had two sons. Not twins. A few years apart. She came from the Philippines and married a white guy to get a ticket to america. I probably should have put that in the original listing but I wasn't really thinking of her ethnicity. I don't know anything about the religion there or how women are raised or taught 

She wasn't exactly somebody you went and had a civil conversation with. So I didn't know her too deeply nor did I ever care to | It's possible she was abused as a child (around the start of puberty) and blamed and called a whole by her own mother. Classic religious denial protect the male abuser crap.¬† | It has been forever since I saw that movie. I remember her religious mother getting mad about her period but I couldn't remember why. I thought her mother believed it was because she lost her virginity but not necessarily because she cheated. Like a girl's period only started the day after she lost her for virginity whereas this crazy woman thought a woman got her period if she cheated (was a whore). I don't know. I haven't watch that movie and quite a number of years. Although this woman wasn't christian. She came from the Philippines and I actually have no idea what religion she was if she was any religion at all. And I think in that movie it was Christianity wasn't it? I could once more be wrong | Who knows. It's not like we could have a civil conversation or anything. It always made me wonder. I mean she had to have. Herself in order to have children. They weren't twins so it was two separate pregnancies. But she wasn't exactly the type of person you sat down and talked to. Or maybe she had some biological dysfunction even though she had all of her parts. I honestly have no idea. It never made any sense to me whatsoever but everything she thought didn't make any sense. Didn't have any mental defects either. These were just things she truly believed in | I'm confused too. If I hadn't answered I would have posted it. But she's not exactly the type that you sit down and have a conversation with or get to know. She was always like this over one thing or another. Just usually her screaming at least had some kind of logic behind it even if it was mean and unnecessary and untrue. This one was just crazy. I don't know the story behind it. I don't know why she believed this. It never made any sense to me either because like I put in my original post, she had two children. Not twins. Yes her biological children. By the same man. So she obviously had her uterus and everything else and stuff was functioning or she wouldn't have been able to have children it baffles me as well | ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | Good point | ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ that would have been hilarious | Oh? Which one? I've read a number of his pieces but then as I got into my adult life I just don't have time to read anymore | With all the comments I'm starting to think so lol but I think she was like Christian and she thought her daughter had lost her virginity and that caused the period whereas this crazy woman I knew thought that unfaithfulness caused. Like you cheated and your period immediately started. How I cheated on a husband I didn't have was a whole different question but there you go... | She also believes that a woman stayed home and never left the house. That men controlled all women. That a woman owed her man sex whenever he demanded it which may lead into the sexual abuse theory I don't know. She believed only a real woman would stay home at all times and raise the children and do the housework etc. A real woman was an obedient slave to her husband. She considered herself the exact prime example of a real woman. No internet. No tv. No radio. Her choice actually. He had no problem with any of those things. But she didn't want to see them so he wasn't allowed to have them in the house because that would make her less of a woman. So it's really kind of hard to tell but she wasn't exactly the type of woman you would sit down and get to know | I've done a lot of those in my life. Doesn't bother me until it affects my life which unfortunately the majority of the time, they make sure it does | I didn't ask that directly but if you do the math then she should have been in her late twenties by her first child. So I would assume she had a period before then? Which wasn't exactly the type of woman you have girl talk with | Lol who knows? Maybe she does have that internal conflict. I wouldn't know myself | I've heard of that before. It's amazing the levels of pure ignorance. Of control. And unfortunately religion is quite often behind it | Yeah I didn't teach her anything. I tried to explain to her that a period was a natural thing a woman went through but somebody who's screaming at the top of their lungs and throwing a fit doesn't exactly hear anything anybody else has to say. Nor was I going to continue to subject myself to the abuse to try to change somebody's mind who obviously was that delusional and stuck in their ways. Not my job | The sad part is, I know she's not the only one. I've only met one person this crazy but I've heard a lot of stories about very similar experiences. People who think women only have their periods once they've lost their virginity. Or that periods only occur immediately after sex. Or men who think that the penetrating the uterus. They think the vagina is on the outside and the part that penis goes in is the uterus. Or men who actually think the baby is in the stomach..... The ignorance is actually quite astounding | I've heard of that one a lot before but I think this one was different. I don't think it was so much a product thing as it was a having a period in the first place thing. She truly believed a woman only had a period if she cheated on her husband. How that logically worked out her brain is a completely different story | It could be mental illness. Could be the way she was raised. Could have been a fear instilled in her. Maybe it was a cultural thing. I have no idea. I try to be understanding but I'm also not going to sit there and be abused ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è so I really didn't know her and I haven't seen her in about 15 years | This implies that I am one.... | Who knows? Wasn't my business. She came from the philippines. Other than the screaming that you only got your period if you were a horror part, she actually really reminds me of a lot of women I meet. They have very abusive husbands while they trot around shouting how a ""real woman"" obeys her husband and does everything he says without question and stays home and does all the housework and raises the children and gives him sex whenever he wants to make sure food is always cooked and never steps outside without his permission blah blah blah blah. 

So if you take away the crazy screaming misunderstanding and her thinking other women don't have periods naturally part..... That I've met a thousand more like her | No only your experiences and the people you have met are reality. Nobody else in the entire rest of the world has had any experiences beyond your own or has ever met anybody beyond those you have met or has ever heard or said or experienced anything beyond what you have. Only what you have personally witnessed yourself could possibly be in existence. Nothing else /s | Hollandaise, H√§agen-Dazs, what's the difference? | Great question. So I was a casino chef on the east coast of the US. Transferred to a property in Ohio that had been going feral without an executive chef for the previous 9 months. First couple days I was there was just going around and documenting the damage. There was a little sit down breakfast outlet which was using powdered hollandaise mix for their hollandaise sauce. Bad enough all by itself, I know. One of the ingredients you added to the powder was milk. The following day I went to that outlet with a list of things to correct and I planned on making it correctly. Turns out it had already been made for the day by an old timer with ‚Äúsixty years experience‚Äù he claimed, and he casually informed me that he could not find any milk for the hollandaise so he went over to the buffet and went to the ice cream machine. Said he did it all the time. He got very offended when I threw away his hollandaise, after I tried to explain to him that what he did was totally unacceptable, as was using powdered mix. He yelled alot. Told me I didn‚Äôt know shit and walked off for awhile.  I made it correctly, and we made it correctly going forward, but that first time I remember thinking I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm having this conversation right now. | I would also like to know. I worked as a chef for years, have made hollandaise from scratch *many* times, but I have never used ice cream, cream, milk, or any dairy other than butter (and egg yolk if you count those as dairy) | I think they mean Hollandaise as a topping? ü§Æ | Not very well or at all. | If they answer, I hope you‚Äôll be proud of what you‚Äôve unleashed upon us all. | It‚Äôs 2 parts ice cream, 1 part methamphetamine | By hollandaise nuts üòé

I apologize for giving into the intrusive thoughts. I'll see myself out. | Yes | Do you really think that aspargus makes a good matchup with Vanilla and Chocolate? | I remember that on the tv news.  He was s US Senator, and he said that in a Senate hearing. He might have phrased it as a question. But i thought an Air Force bade was being planned to be built or expanded and that was when he brought up his dumb thought. Something like, ‚Äú if it‚Äôs built on one side of the island, won‚Äôt it tip the whole island over into the ocean?‚Äù  Wow‚Ä¶.crazy Senator. | Yep, this right here. And its TOO common. Remember that one jackass¬†Todd Akin, the Republican Senate nominee from Missouri, stated that in instances of what he called ‚Äúlegitimate rape,‚Äù women‚Äôs bodies somehow blocked an unwanted pregnancy.¬†


¬†‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.""


¬†Around the same time Ohio officials wrote up and pushed a bill to ban abortion introduced in the Ohio state legislature requires doctors to ‚Äúreimplant an ectopic pregnancy‚Äù into a woman‚Äôs uterus ‚Äì a procedure that does not exist in medical science ‚Äì or face charges of ‚Äúabortion murder‚Äù.


Uneducated people in power are fucking dangerous.¬† | Ok but in reality, Guam will absolutely tip if too many people stand on one side. 

The tilting of Guam has been long documented. With one historian coining the term ‚Äújust a Guam‚Äù, for when something tips over due to weight distribution. | The guy probably played Club Penguin and was at the iceberg all the time to try to get it to tip. | Pretty sure he's still in Congress, unless he lost the last election cycle....you've got be some kind of special to think an island can tip over. | I still have a hard time believing that was real. I have to believe that he was talking metaphorically. Can a human really be *that* stupid? | Oh...oh dear üò¨ | That video of the general explaining it is so wild lol. | an ex, who had a masters degree in business, thought that islands floated in the ocean as well. i asked her why then the islands never moved around, she didnt know. some people lack critical thinking, i dunno | Uggh.. yeah this whole discussion started in the first place because she was wondering aloud why the first day of winter always falls on December 21st (it doesn't) but the first day of summer always bounces around.. I started explaining that the Earth's orbit can't correlate perfectly to whatever man's concepts of calendars and time are before realizing the problem ran much deeper here ü§ê | You learn what causes the seasons in second grade (earth's tilt), and then likely never re-visit that fact again.  They probably just forgot but with some reminding, like mentioning earth's tilt, they'll probably remember.  Case in point, I played checkers for the first time in probably 20 years the other day and had to look up the rules to a very basic game I played a lot as a kid because I completely forgot how to play. | No!!!! | I live in CA and at mammoth and all the other mountains there were a metric fuck ton of aussies working there and I eventually asked one why and they said they come there as summer jobs and of course being young I asked how this is a summer job when it‚Äôs winter here and then he told me in Australia it was summer in winter and winter in summer and blew my mind. | Yes, this was another one of the points I was trying to make that was lost on her... she heard me say ""Christmas is in the summertime"" and took that as me claiming they celebrated it in July or something üòê | This year in Venezuela, it's in October! | Well, this was someone I'd known and worked closely with for years. I'd have been equally as mortified needing to have this discussion with any other adult human being. | All generalisations are stupid | 2024 üò≥ | I think the 'tubes' guy was Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska.' | How can a calendar be backwards?

Are these the same people who properly believe that we all live upside down? | We've had a few 40 degree Christmas days in WA. If it tops at 35 she's golden.

It's been hitting 40 the last week up in the Kimberleys, and we've only been out of winter a week. They are proper cooked come summer. | Summer¬† | New Zealander here. We have summer Christmas in December. Right now, Winter has just finished, and we‚Äôre now into Spring. If we wanted to experience a ‚ÄúWhite Christmas‚Äù with snow and all that, we‚Äôd have to travel to somewhere on the other side of the planet. | They call it summer. | Oh my god. What do you think? | Um....what are you trying to say? | We are in Canada but she is the farthest thing from an R... 

Not sure if that makes it worse or better. | I think it was to make sure we understood basic concepts, like ""less than,"" ""greater than,"" or ""equal to"" in French. | The French pioneered the metric system. They even had metric time, briefly. | That was delightful. | I remember this being on our milk cartons when I was in elementary school. I was a dumb kid and said ""the stone, of course!"" but as soon as it was explained to me I understood. How an adult could not is honestly beyond me. | Someone should tell her that in a vacuum, a feather and a brick will fall at the same rate. That will blow her mind. | That is still not true. First, a kilogram is a unit of mass. So a kilogram of feathers will ABSOLUTELY have the same mass as a kilogram of stone, by definition. What may be slightly different is what gravity based scales will show you as the mass, because they don't actually measure mass but force. In Germany, e.g. supermarket scales actually print the receipt in N (Newton), not kg.

If you would build a scale on a different principle, e.g. centripetal force, you would get the correct result.

Also, the main reason why feathers are light is because they have a lot of empty space, not because the material that is displacing air is particularly light. Actually, the density or Keratin is not too far away from concrete. This does not contribute to buoyancy, just as a barrel full of water will not float better than a log of the same amount of wood. | It's been a bit to long for me to remember her reasoning unfortunately. | Sounds familiar. That may have been her logic. 

One of my male friends said and I quote ""haha we don't need women we can fuck each other"" in Goofy's voice when I told him | And could cause mouth cancer | Oh wow! That is so interesting! I couldn't do that, as I'm allergic to alcohol, but what an amazing thing!! | Sounds like a junkie to me. Trying to return something obviously not returnable. Being very extra about it. Being cool a week later while having money to spend. 

Source: Former junkie. | The women ran out of the building before the police showed up and the police just laughed it off after I explained the situation. | They took him to jail, obviously. | At least this story is about kids, but: When I was a kid (like 8 or 9), the Soviet Union was still around. Me and my friend were playing some kind of a pseudo-strategy game with a standard paper map of the world. The way it was orientated essentially split the Soviet Union so the Eastern and Western parts of the map were both the USSR. I remember he was saying our enemy is on both sides of us. (I think the idea was we were the US and were trying to beat the the Soviets in a war using military themed toys he had.)

Anyway, after a little bit, another friend came over and completely refused to accept that it could be the same country on both sides and demanded we could only have one of the ""two countries"" be the Soviet Union.

Admittedly, this friend was 9 or 10, but was completely unable to understand the concept of a country ""wrapping around"" a flat map. I think we even tried to explain ti by bending the map so the two parts of the Soviet Union touched and was like... see? The map has to split somewhere. Kid kept insisting only one of them could bte Soviet Union. He just could not accept anything else. | Something that wasn‚Äôt talked about in school (mine at least) | *The West Wing* taught me about [map projection](https://youtu.be/UPaca-SrvEk?si=nPeF_J_lgtZpuzs2). | I don't think they were talking about projection.  I think it was one of those mainland US maps that show Alaska and Hawaii separately in a smaller scale box in the corner of the map. | [True size of](https://www.thetruesize.com/#?borders=1~!MTc3ODc2MDc.MzgwMDgw*MzYwMDAwMDA) | I'd attribute this to a lack of education, not stupidity


Note: I edited to add that most countries are never told that the world map is not up to scale. | Wouldn't Alaska look larger by an even greater factor on a full world map though? In most projections, at least. | Then they learn about map projections and start buying the idea that Mercator is a terrible projection. It's not. It was great for navigation, that it became standard was based on that.

If you want the best map projection available, use a globe. | to be fair, the first time i even heard about this was when i was like 22, i just never thought about how a flat map of a round object could even exist.  
but yeah, just thinking about it for more than 2 seconds you can tell that anything near the north and south needs to stretch a ton, which is also why you will never see world map have any reference for distance, like you see on maps of cities or countries (i.e. x cm are 10km) | Scale is correct in this case. The map had the contiguous 48 in the main box with Alaska and Hawaii in separate small boxes in the lower corners. The contiguous 48 were represented at X miles per inch, Alaska was Y miles per inch and Hawaii was Z inches per inch. | It's actually sealed to make US and northern countries look bigger. Look at how big Africa actually is vs US or Russia. | He would just shrug to that and keep rejecting my arguments. He was a very stupid man | When I was a freshie in college, I tried to explain to a 23-year-old guy who'd missed some required lower-division classes that the reason there are different words for most animals is because they reflect the sex of the animal. He absolutely wasn't buying that there's any difference between a bull and a cow or a stallion and a mare. (I was not about to get into more complex stuff like steers or geldings until he had the basic differences down.) 

Since his list of objections to what I was trying to tell him included the facts that I was 18 and female, our professor cleared the it up immediately by having an impromptu 30 minute lesson on animal terminology. He prefaced the entire thing by writing ""TAKE NOTES, POP QUIZ LIKELY"" at the top of the board. I don't know how Mr. Senior Guy did, but it was basically a gift of 25 points for the rest of us. | Talking about this. A girl posted a video of a rooster on her story and I replied ‚Äúthat‚Äôs your chicken?‚Äù 

She replied laughing and very condescendingly asked ‚Äúdoes that look like a chicken????‚Äù

Baffled, I asked, so what is it? Thinking I may have mistaken it for a turkey or something 

She said that ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a rooster üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠‚Äù

I don‚Äôt talk to her anymore | I used to raise chickens, and it was a daily occurrence that I had to explain to people that a rooster is a chicken. It seems most people think chickens are all female for some reason? | I had a coworker who thought hens laid white eggs and roosters laid brown eggs. | There are people who aren‚Äôt aware that a ram is a male sheep. It was a plot point in a book where a guy wanted to use sheep because he needed a very docile animal and didn‚Äôt realize that male sheep are very much not docile | Ok so Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster.
The rooster goes with the chicken. 
So, who‚Äôs having sex with the hen? | Should just ask him the other word for rooster, aka cock and that should be pretty self explanatory | Are ""roosters"" ""Capons"" then? | Cock would make clearer | A whole bunch of people don't understand this one. | I told my 28 year old coworker that I raise chickens for eggs and she asked if I had a rooster; I told her I didn't because of the noise and she said ""how are you going to get eggs then?"" | So chicken have sex and that‚Äôs how a chick hatches out of the egg? Otherwise it stays an egg? | When I was a kid, my teacher told the class chickens only lay eggs when they're fertilized and we only eat the eggs were the embryo died before hatching. | This made me laugh | You put some real work into that lol. Take my up vote. | I may have choked and scared my poor dog with laughter. We are both ok now. | They arrive in a beatup multi colored tahoe you can hear commin before you see it around me. Its like a weird ice cream jingle pavlov response haha. | This is mostly funny due to the dirty Hyundai Sonata reference. | I laughed way hard at this | Ow, tear laugh, *sniffs*. | It's not like we do. It's either a 'cloacal kiss', or.... Duck sex | We have a pair of wild galahs that nest in our backyard. Every nesting season we look out a window and are greeted with bow chicka bow wow bird scenes in our garden. Oh, they get in ON. | Maybe they are relatives | To be fair, it's weird that chickens will still lay eggs without having had sex. Maybe that's where your coworker got mixed up. As a kid I was really confused about how an unfertilized egg could exist. I guess they thought that was too explicit to teach us in school?? I knew that fish eggs got fertilized after being laid, so I thought somehow maybe chicken eggs got fertilized in a similar way? But the shell is in the way, so I thought it was more likely that all eggs were fertilized and the other person was just lying to me so I wouldn't think I was eating a baby chick. | Chicken sex is very brief and kind of horrific | This made me look up exactly how chickens create eggs, and at what stage the sperm goes into the egg if it is fertilised. I don't fancy eating eggs any more now. | If a rooster lays an egg and a toad incubates it, what hatches out is a cockatrice and then you've got REAL problems. | Yes, but if you want more info there was actually a post on ELI5 just the other day asking about it and I know several people (me included) wrote almost an essay on the subject: [https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1fa0qr1/eli5can\_someone\_please\_explain\_chicken\_eggs\_to\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1fa0qr1/eli5can_someone_please_explain_chicken_eggs_to_me/) | I have a friend that‚Äôs in the Jane religion, and a real true follower of that religion doesn‚Äôt eat eggs. She came to the United States when she was a kid, so she does, but her kids also follow the same religion, and she felt she should at least teach them that eggs count as meat. But I think they eat eggs too. Maybe in India it‚Äôs not so easy to get unfertilized eggs, so they have to count. | Please tell me you have named him, I need to know for scientific purposes | fun facts! opossums can eat up to 5000 ticks per year and they cannot get rabies because their body temp is too low. they also only live 2-3 years and they‚Äôre the only marsupial in america. | We have one or two that sometimes come at night to eat our cats food. The cat is technically my sister in laws but I'm pretty he doesn't even know them ad he spends all his time at our house or exploring fields. | Yo please be careful, opossums and other wild animals can still spread diseases through urine, saliva, feces, etc. | Honestly this is a dream | My friendly opossum loves grapes and peanuts in a shell. Stops by for a visit every night hoping to get there before the raccoon family. | I feel like most housepets realize that an opossum is the animal equivalent of that stoner neighbor, you see them around sometimes, usually they're just chilling, thinking about food, and really don't have a lot of ambition or much going on in their head.  My old neighbors had some stray/feral/wild/whatever outdoor cats that they would leave kibble out for, and their patio cam always had nighttime videos of the cats crowding around the bowl for a snack then a possum would just walk up, wedge itself amongst the cats, and have itself some meow mix.  None of the cats really seemed to care after the 2nd or 3rd time it happened. | My grandparents caught a possum once. It loved my grandma but would hiss and growl at my grandpa. It was adorable and huge. Pretty sure they just held it while waiting for animal control, but it was a fun guest for a couple days. | My husband was lamenting a ground wasp nest in our backyard that made it so he couldn't finish mowing the lawn.

The next morning he went out in long sleeves and long pants and it was GONE. A skunk had demolished it overnight. | Armadillos are the worst, my yard will break your ankle. | My grandpa lost his cat to a neighbor lady that did this. She dropped him off at a shelter and they euthanized. He was devastated.

Sincerely, fuck that lady. She‚Äôs almost certainly dead by now but I hope she has the afterlife she deserves. | I love animals so I had to Google it but where in the world do they call them whistle pigs? In the northeastern US I've only ever heard them called groundhogs | I'm sure burninating the lawn together with the peasants would also work. | Meow meow meow meow¬† | That's right, loved cats are kept inside. But this jamoke was trapping his neighbors belongings. And the neighbor probably thought they were doing their best by putting a collar on it. The neighbor is probably just one of those idiots who believe that cats are wild and have to be let outside. | Reads like a pokemon evolution. | Yeah, well, you know that‚Äôs just like, uh‚Ä¶your opinion, man.¬† | She claimed one of the plants peed under her tire, causing it to slide. | If she did, I never heard about it. I was working part time there and it was the end of my shift and I left while she was screaming into her phone.

For the reason why, look at my name. | That sounds like the man was raised in a cult that believed a crappy sci fi flick was real | there‚Äôs no fucking way. my mom is in the exact same cult and i thought they were primarily russian speaking but i guess not??? | He watched too much BSG | That's only mildly better than the one where instead of UFO, it's God created white people in his image and all who aren't white descended from monkeys and are just smart animals. | Wow, my grandfather is just like that xD

It was very eye opening how poor our sexual health classes are.. | Haha. True. I had someone try to convince me there was something called a ""clitoris"". Nice try! | To be fair, young women barely know what's going on down there either, I had to explain to a girlfriend that she had a urethra above her vaginal opening, and below her clitoris. She thought the pee came out of her vagina. I grabbed a hand mirror and pointed it out for her. | I'm a middle-class man in Brazil. Private school throughout my whole life, even if getting in debt for it, college degree with more debt. But simply being able to acquire that debt already says something about my social position in a country like Brazil.

My social circles are pretty well educated. Reading about how ""most"" young men have no idea about female anatomy always felt a bit unbelievable to me. I used to think it was an exaggeration. I used to think when I interacted with someone like that, I was interacting with an actually dumb person, an exception.

Then, last year, I worked in an office of a more traditional company with hundreds of employees and a more representative cut of society.

The things I heard from the men there when there were no women around left me flabbergasted. The misogyny by itself did that, but the sheer percentage of men who didn't understand and actively refused to try to understand reproduction would be amazing if not so scary.

It's not stupidity, they're perfectly capable of understanding the mechanics. They just psychologically refuse to when the subject is women.

Society is a helluva drug. | I think it really matters if you have sisters or not.¬†

Moms are not going to talk about any of this with their sons.¬†

And sex ed for me was 100% about men. Women were not mentioned.¬† | I find this profoundly confusing. You best believe that when I knew I liked girls I looked up how all that downstairs business works.

How you gonna say you like pussy and know nothing about pussy? | And most young women. Few people know the difference between a vulva and labia. | Many woman don‚Äôt know their bodies either -  if you ask them to label a picture of the female anatomy , many struggle lol . But especially individuals who grow up in religious or closed society environments , they really struggle .they get all their sex education from porn or friends when they grow up | It‚Äôs not just men‚Ä¶ They are plenty of women, many here on reddit who have admitted, they didn‚Äôt know the difference in the urethra and the vagina | Sex ed in America is atrocious. Took me a bachelors, grinding for MCAT, and a current 1.5 years of med school to know more than 99% of population on female reproductive system. AND even then, Ill never know what its truly like to have menstrual cramps, pain, etc cuz I‚Äôm not a woman. 

As a future doc, trying my best to be conscious of not downplaying a woman‚Äôs pain (or for any person‚Äôs for that matter) cuz I know there‚Äôs been a lot of historical stigma on that. My pain will be perceived differently than someone else‚Äôs pain (but I admittedly do not have a great pain tolerance lmao) | People.

Most women don't know anything either.

Which is so weird because our country has comprehensive sex ed and biology for 5 years of mandatory schooling. | ""... and then I peed in her butt, so she got pregenent!"" | Most don't have much idea about male anatomy aside from the immediately obvious. | You're right, but that isn't an excuse. With internet access being common, it's simply wilfull ignorance to understand this little about their partner. I believe men attracted to women should make an effort to understand basic female anatomy so that they understand their partner's anatomy better. It's selfish imo for them to not understand the anatomy of their partner as it can lead to incorrect assertions (like thinking his partner cheated on him because she got her period) and an unfulfilled sex life. 

For the record, I believe women attracted to men should also understand basic male anatomy. | Hey babe, can you shave your uvula?  

/s | At 23 he thought the bleeding m happened due to his penis penetrated the uterus? At that age, a lot of people have a university degrees. Yeah no, this guy was is a fucking moron. | My parents got me a sex ed book when I was 10, called ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on down there‚Äù. I‚Äôm glad they did, because I learned a lot from it, unlike some others. 

But I imagine they were not so pleased when I told them I wanted to buy an orchidometer to measure my testicular development.

I was a weird kid for sure. | And it often doesn't get much better as they age! | The number of grown men that think women piss from their vagina is outrageous. | Ignorance itself is a benign flaw that can be rectified if one has the humility and willingness to know better when the opportunity presents itself.

That's where he miserably failed. | That‚Äôs really not normal though. Wtf is wrong with sex ed? | We all knew about ALL human anatomy back in the day, sex education was taught in PE during our sophomore year in high school.

Nine weeks of teaching helped us know the ins and outs of both our own anatomy and the female anatomy and the processes of both.

Women were taught in the same class as men, which led to a lot of nervous giggles and such.

We did have breakouts to discuss male and female sexuality without the other gender there. | I am more sad how many women don't know but yeah even many adult males I know have no idea about women. | I had no idea vaginas were so far down. I was about 8 or 9 when I first saw a naked lady. Thought, ""huh. That doesn't seem right"". Fast forward a few years, we had cable internet and google was a thing. Learned a whole lot of things. | I learned most of what I needed to know by examining the instructions in my older sisters box of tampons. | *most young men in backwards societies that dont give a fuck about women.

I remember biology class very well. My teacher was a feminist and she made sure the boys knew everything about reproduction. | He sounds like a terrible lay | Don't generalize us. Here in Germany, we have multiple sex ed classes over the years of schooling and they do teach it correctly. | Our sex ed class was more like a sales pitch for the ""power of prayer."" It worked on some, but this atheist knows what to do with a clitoris. My wife has friends that have been married for years and they've never orgasmed. Shit's wild. | All the more amazing that these ignorant men feel that only THEY should be making decisions about women's health. | MAGAt men have entered the chat ;) | To be fair, even the women can be pretty clueless as well. They aren't necessarily being taught anything more than the men about their own bodies. Which is pretty sad. | I think it varies greatly depending upon *where and when* you were taught about sex education. I went to a pretty progressive middle school  in NY during the 70s and we were taught about human sexual reproduction in great detail. | They taught me about the full menstrual cycle in seventh grade, and most American schools that I know do it in a similar age range | she did.

I told her about that conversation shortly after and she sent him a text saying something like ""how and why would you date and have sex with women if you cant even grasp how periods work"", thats all she said and he responded that he felt **intimidated** being with a woman who ""thinks she knows more than her boyfriend"".

this guy really tried to correct her on how her own body works and acted like he knew more.

so that's how we also learned this guy was secretly some weird traditionalist incel type, and she dumped him over text on the spot right after that.

on the bright side, the guy she started dating after him is the polar opposite of him and is her fiance now :) | ""...wow..."" | ex, I have another comment explaining more about the situation somewhere else in this thread | how does his wife feel about his ignorance of her own anatomy? | guess again, born and raised in the deep south | their **angina**? none | An election | what wife? | It's a religious thing. He likely had a concerned look on his face because he was realizing for the first and most public time how much churches will bullshit since they declared ducks to be fish and thus allowed for eating for lent.

Seems that [beavers, alligators and puffins](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/k3gb3h/til_that_beavers_alligators_and_puffins_are/) have also been declared to be fish. Tbh as a liberal I'm happier with this kind of flexibility than with selectively enforced fundamentalist bullshit. | I mean technically phylogenetically speaking all terrestrial vertebrates are fish. All vertebrates evolved from a tetrapod fish and you can't evolve out of a clade!

*Edit* meant land vertebrates sorry for getting it wrong! | Want your mind blown? Male ducks don‚Äôt keep their fancy feathers year round. Once mating season is over they molt and match the females for a short while late summer-fall. | Ok im gonna blow your mind but many many species of various animals females are generally muted colors or really try to blend in with their environment while makes are the bright colored ones that stick out. This is because the females stay on the nest in the tree to protect the eggs/young so she has to blend in while the male has to be showy to attract the female in the first place and or lure predators away from the nest. | Honestly our society seems like it's actively trying to cause this mistake with the way they portray male and female animals in cartoons | I fucking loved duck hunt. | Your teacher probably read you a version of the famous musical fairytale ""Peter and the Wolf"" by Sergei Prokofjew, in which each animal is represented by a different musical instrument (or they played a recording for you).


In this story, the bird (represented by the flute) does indeed ask the duck (represented by the oboe) ""what kind of bird are you, if you can't even fly?""


The reason for this is, that this was a domesticated duck living on the farm of Peter's grand father, and most domesticated duck variants have indeed lost the ability to fly. Most likely the domesticated ducks that Prokofjew was familiar with were such flightless variants. | What a perfect opportunity to reference that ü§£ | Given the right hormones and some gumption, *probably*. | The day will.come when one of us makes that reference and people say ""who's Greg?"" | Jinxy Cat Jinxy Cat I love you.¬† | Only if you are ready for the result | See, this is pure golden Redditing. | God I love that movie! Great timing on the reference lol | Yes please. Get over here, stepredditor! | Put this on a funking T Shirt and I'll wear it to picture day | *easily* | Well technically, his argument would have been that *humans* breastfeed so men have nipples. 

Of course, this is completely ignoring that mammals have mammary glands in different places and they probably have never checked the mammary gland regions of a dog or a bull and realized they all have residual ‚Äúnipples‚Äù | Obviously not.  He's a male! | I've got nipples Greg, can you milk me? | Male rats don't either. Maybe it's a rodent thing? | Male mice don't either. Easy way to determine gender when they're pups. | Whaaaat??

Some people mix beef and sausage together to make a tastier patty. | Just like a chicken burger has chicken in it. | So, if a hamburger is made from beef, what is a beef burger? | Wich stems from hamster | HAMBURG er | Why would they name the city Hamburg if it produces beef?! | Yeah it's understandable to not know this.

Turkey burger, chicken burger, beef burger, hamburger. You can see why people would think it's made with ham.

A woman I know became vegetarian but kept eating cheeseburgers because she believed they were made from cheese. Like, the sinewy brown consistency of the burger, with a cheese slice on it, didn't give her a clue. She stopped once someone told her it was in fact a beef burger, with cheese. | In the 70's, A-1 Steak Sauce had commercials for putting the sauce on hamburgers.  ""Why? They're not chopped ham, they're chopped steak.""  Anyone over 40 should recall that. | Ok, now explain a chicken burger. | And even then, it's because the meat inside the sandwich is a Hamburg Steak. We lose the meaning because in most places we usually only eat a Hamburg steak in the sandwich, rather than on its own. | ICH BIN EIN... | So it's made out of people from Hamburg? | that's hamsoylent. | I promise you it‚Äôs not the same woman, but I bet my ex and that woman would be two peas in a pod. | My knee jerk reaction was to go for the downvote from the sheer stupidity of what you expressed.

But what about Beyonce? She had her priorities straight. | That‚Äôs a whole new level of fucked up | Oh yea, they don‚Äôt teach that in America.

My boss was in a video that went around probably 6 years ago where a fight was happening while he was on shift and it just turned into a riot. | Oh yeah, I recall one of the big factors on how the adults ruin the place is how CEC serves alcohol, while there is a rule that limited how much a person could drink, there was an easy loophole to get by it and the employees weren‚Äôt given an incentive to care | Still shocks me that cec can get so bad they need cops. | How do you think I felt trying to type it out?

Is actually a joke on British TV
 But I have heard this in real life. 

And omg makes me so mad. 

This bag thing is triggering me in the same way haha | I take reusable bags for this reason. Even if you completely ignore any environmental concerns, it's just more convenient to use my own. I buy a lot of groceries because I have a big family. When the store bags them, you open the trunk and it's just a mess of handles everywhere. If you only pick up one handle, the bag tilts and either breaks or dumps out the contents (or both.) So I have to stand there and figure out which handles to grab, and there's a thousand of them. I end up making more trips back and forth from the trunk to the door. When I'm in a hurry or it's raining, it's nice to be able to grab 1/10 as many bags for the same amount of groceries. | Why are you putting your gallons of milk in a bag? They have handles. | Remember, like back in the day? Because this is super common today with younger generation cashiers. I use cash over card a lot, and they can't math at all.... Even with a computer right in front of them.... | [Here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/thatHappened/comments/opm4dr/because_a_walmart_employee_would_totally_do_this/) | This was told to me so either it really happened or he stole the story. I‚Äôm not trying to pass it off as anything except for what was told to me. | I've taken 2 years of physics and... Tbh I don't understand why either. Electricity hurts my brain. | hell, even people who's job is understanding electricity. I haven't met an electrician or engineer that hasn't been caught out by electricity being barely contained sorcery. | When I was a kid, one of our neighbors had these little plastic things that were designed to plug into outlets. They were to keep kids from sticking things in the outlet, but he insisted it was to keep the electricity in an unused socket, otherwise it'd fall out and set the house on fire. | That's why I always opt for the outlets with covers. Can't have that electricity leaking.    /s | One time in seventh grade or so we had physics lessons and the teacher asked us about all the methods we use to generate electricity. A bunch of kids raised their hands and said smart things like nuclear and coal and wind and solar. And then one girl proudly says ""power outlet"". We all laugh. I look at her, expecting her to laugh as well, because that was a funny and well timed joke. But she just looks HORRIFIED. She was NOT kidding. She looked like she'd prefer to just sink through the floor into a different classroom. Poor girl. | Ooh marshmallows! | Yeah it sounds dumb to people that work with electricity but it's really not fair to judge a person for thinking that way. I've seen people complain that they wanted a bigger computer because it must be faster than the smaller one. If you don't know how things work, basic (if flawed) logic wins out sometimes. | > then I can use more watts

Sure, you *can*, but you won't, unless you are actually adding more load to the panel. | Yes it depends on how much you use, not how big your service is.

If you have a 100a service and use 50amps, then upgrade to a 200a service and still only use 50 amps, your bill won't change | If you have a one bedroom apartment and you move to a two bedroom apartment are you going to suddenly get twice the amount of sleep?

If you buy a second car will the number of miles that you drive double?

Of course not.

Adding extra *capacity* does not add extra *usage*.

Just because you *can* doesn't mean that you automatically *will*. Increasing the breaker size alone doesn't magically mean that you'll use more energy. If you then choose to use more energy, that's your fault and not the breaker's. | Some people think we‚Äôre domed | ""Yes, just turn around your screen"" | An easy way to think about this is that 100 is divisible evenly by 4. So any multiple of 100 would also be divisible by four, meaning you can ignore anything in the hundreds column or greater. This leaves just the last two digits that need to be divisible evenly by four. | https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisibility_rule | 168,276 √∑ 4 = 42,069 neat | I taught these rules.  Math is cool. | Because 100 is divisible by 4, so if you get rid of all digits except for the last two you get the same remainder.¬† | 100 is divisible by 4.  Therefore 1000 is. 10,000 is etc.  So you get to ""ignore"" all numbers past the 10s place in determining if something is divisible by 4. | Seriously, why the hell didn't my teachers teach this shit when I was in school? This could've saved me so much time | So yeah, 12 is divisible by 4, and 100 is divisible by 4, so all of 112, 212, 312, 412, etc. are divisible by 4. Sub 12 for 36, 54, 92, whatever you want and the rule holds true.

I guess the same rule would work for 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50, as 100 is divisible by all of them as well. So 125, 225, 325, 425, etc. are all divisible by 5. | Similarly, if the last 3 digits of the number are divisible by 8, so is the entire number. You can you use this pattern to check divisibility by any power of 2. | 100 is divisible by 4, and all the numbers besides the last two are divisible by 100, so they'll always be divisible by 4. So, if all you want to know is whether it's divisible or not, you only need to look at the last two digits.

Same as being divisible by 10 or by 50.

----

Anyway, though, it's not *quite* true, because there's an exception: any number that ends in 00.

400 is obviously divisible by 4, but if you're going by this rule, you'd only look at the last two numbers: 00, and that's *not* divisible by 4. | In a big number you can ignore the whole part above 100, because a 100, a 1000, a 10000000 and so on is obviously divisible by 4, it's the last 2 digits that matter. | She finally pulled out a calculator | Jesus Christ, even if you don't understand the explanation you can confirm the fact by actually doing it. That's fucking *what mathematics is for.* | Arrogance of some teachers. They are teaching YOU, so they obviously know more of the things. They couldn‚Äôt possibly learn anything from their students. | This offends me on a deep level. | Here's the thing: any math teacher knows this. I'm operating based on a country with pretty involved requirements to be a teacher, but even here if your teaching area wasn't math, you never needed to do a math course. Plenty of elementary teachers could get through their degrees without ever learning high school math (assuming they passed with enough of a grade to get into education, which can be either impossibly high or literally ""do you have a pulse"" depending on the uni). 

When I as a physicist took my elementary math methods course, everything we had to learn was common sense and completely basic to me. But the vast majority of the class struggled immensely with it. 

If a substitute doesn't know the content, they go off the key. If the key says (do x), and they don't know the content, they'll go off the key. That being said, understanding commutative property is pretty fucking basic, understanding order of operations is pretty basic, and no sub should be yelling at a student for doing something ""wrong"". At absolute worst, their response should have been ""if you're getting the right answer okay, but your teacher may insist on it being this way, so it might be good to practice that"". 

I hate that there isn't a category for ""qualified math sub"" in our dispatch systems. | Hehe, minds like yours are in [good company] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression#History). | It does feel wrong though to be fair. I would initially think you would have to half both numbers, not just the base. It still hurts my brain to be honest why only halving 1 number gives the correct answer. | When I was at university, the lowest rung were the education majors. Complete morons I‚Äôm afraid. At least there. | Reminded me of the time I ""failed"" my dosage calculation test in nursing school. I got literally every answer correct but I didn't ""show my work.""

Like bitch, my work is the correct dose being listed for the patient. | Wait thats neat, thanks | Same when I learned the rule.  Do you know the rules for  4, 6, 8, and 9? | I was wondering how to explain the multiples of 3 better. | Well it doesn‚Äôt actually make dividing easier.  It just makes it easy to figure out what the number is divisible by without actually doing it.  But here‚Äôs the entire rules from 1-10.

0, 1, and 2 are a given.  Everything is divisible by 1, nothing is divisible by 0.  2 is even numbers which I‚Äôm sure you know.  

Now 3, you add up every number in the sequence, then add the total of those numbers till you get a single number.  If it‚Äôs 3, 6, or 9, it‚Äôs divisible by 3.  If it adds up to 9, it‚Äôs divisible by 9.  If the rule for both 3 and 2 can apply, it‚Äôs divisible by 6.

Again, 5 and 10 are easy.  If the number ends in 5 or 0, it‚Äôs divisible by 5.  If by 0 only, it‚Äôs divisible by 10.

Now since 100 is divisible by 4, you only have to look at the last 2 numbers in the sequence.  If the last 2 are divisible by 4, the entire number sequence is divisible by 4.  If the last 3 numbers are divisible by 8, the entire sequence is divisible by 8.

7 doesn‚Äôt have a rule, at least a rule that I know of.

It‚Äôs all fascinating to me, especially the fact that 3 and 9 are so easy to figure out no matter how long the number sequence is. | I'm retrospect, this is also untrue for 120, 136, 160, etc..

So I guess it is a shorthand test of confirming that it is, but is not a safe assumption that a number is not divisible by 4 if it does not meet this criteria. | Yeah, it would help with traces but the heavy lifting will be the barrier. | I would just dunk my tiny massive dick in a jug of isopropyl alcohol and let bygones be bygones. | It might *help,* but definitely not enough to stop its propagation. | Maybe an alcoholic wipe? | No it does nothing lmao you can't wash off an std...... | Does he believe that?

Everything else you listed is an animal. Your level of comfort might be different depending on the particular type of animal, but an insect is an animal.  You can‚Äôt argue that. | Well, the debate wasn't about ""how meaningful life is,"" it was a discussion of ""favorite animals."" 
The person in question is an adult (circa 60 y/o) who it turned out prioritized her ""feeling"" of ""bugs being weird"" over biological kingdom categorization. 

I would disagree with your entire framing anyway, though, and it sounds like you're just uncomfortable with your social proximity to some animals over others (plants are in a separate kingdom btw) and are rationalizing it by devaluing their lives. When you are killing a fish or a snail, for example, you are indisputably ending as much of a life just as you would be killing a dog. One is more socially acceptable because we think of dogs, who are more biologically similar to us, primarily as companion animals. I'm always surprised by how uncomfortable people are with that fact and how dramatically they often respond to it. | All life is meaningful, and look up any insect on wikipedia you will see it is part of the kingdom Animalia.

That will significantly decrease the battery life over time. | Things clearly DO just break, unless you're really extending the idea of ""wear and tear"" to cover EVERY problem that involves entropy. | Once asked for a source, and he brought me to some myspace era we site that some guy is hosting from his basement. Had to explain to him that literally every other paragraph was trying to sell him CBD. Almost like it had ulterior motives than ""The Truth"" | Nah man. The government covers it up. | I grew up in a really weird environment because my Dad was both a biology teacher and devoutly religious. (Still alive, just retired now lol) Wholeheartedly understood evolution, taught it in school and everything. When I got to my first complex evolution/biology unit in middle school, he was very dissatisfied with how ""shallow"" the text described evolution and phylogenies and that type of stuff and took many hours of his time to break it down for me, he absolutely loved it and instilled a love of animals and biology in me. But went to church every Sunday and I still had a lot of ""Would god be happy you did x?"" Type conversations with him as well, The Bible was definitely on his bookshelf and well worn. I really should take the time to sit down and delve deeper into his perspective. ¬†Edit: to everyone telling me you can be religious and still understand science, you don't need to tell me, I obviously know that given the context of my story. I grew up with a guy like that lol. Talk to your fellow Christians who are trying to destroy our country.¬† | I have a 53 year old friend who thought dinosaurs were imaginary like unicorns. I asked her wtf she thought those giant skeletons in the museum and fossils were? She thought they were planted by conspiracy theorists. | "" you can believe those existed"", not there's evidence those existed? Note the language choice, belief being a virtue to the religious. | She was probably proud that her young daughter didn't take anything those damn scientists said at face value | He doesn‚Äôt have one. That‚Äôs the issue. Very defensive about it, too. | ‚ÄúTrust me bro‚Äù | Spontaneous permutation. Every now and then a new one appears | Yes, my adorable little niece is now a pretty young woman and absolutely believes the earth is 6,000 years old.  It makes me sad more than anything. | I too am a dino nerd of your age | My college had something called Dinosaur Day where the public could come and celebrate all things dinosaur and I had come back there just to volunteer for it. I then went to buy something from someone down the street and mentioned that was where I had been. Almost stumbled over my own feet when the guy started ranting about how he didn't believe in any of that stuff the devil created to confuse people and he had no idea such a place that promoted it was so close by. It was so out of left field as he seemed like a normal human being up until that point. | You need to use a special stone. | Well, the viruses do, somebody has to talk to them. | Don‚Äôt ever call someone narcissistic to their face. To them, they‚Äôre just defending themselves. That‚Äôll shut a conversation down so fast. Maybe stubborn. Or illogical. | This is incorrect. Speciation has been observed many times, in addition to the overwhelming evidence of past speciation. | A theory is the highest thing something can be in science. A theory doesn't eventually graduate to a law. There is a law of gravity and a theory of gravity. The theory of gravity offers an explanation for how gravity works. The law of gravity describes the observed phenomenon of gravity. Likewise evolution has observed phenomenon and the theory of evolution is an explanation of that observation. | Gravity is a theory. Relativity is a theory. Germs causing disease is a theory. Earth going around the Sun is a theory.

All of science is theories, the word means something different in a scientific context than in casual usage (which is closer to a hypothesis). | A ‚ÄúTheory‚Äù in the context of science is not the same meaning as a ‚ÄúTheory‚Äù used in casual conversation. A scientific theory is treated as fact, unless one day scientifically proven otherwise. | Somebody doesn't understand the definition of theory in a scientific context. | There are the facts of evolution, the body of evolutionary theory and the various theories of evolution. | Hey Pal, Thanks for showing us all you don‚Äôt understand the use of the word ‚ÄòTheory‚Äô in science. | I‚Äôve been there too (not by choice) and they throw all sorts of shit out the window. They claimed the Trex was a herbivore or some shit while on the boat. I literally couldn‚Äôt take that place seriously and managed to have fun laughing at all the bs with my brother and cousins | So you are saying dinosaurs are a Jewish conspiracy then? /s

(also culturally Jewish here) | Yooo I'm also a left wing atheist jew | Are you really left wing, or are you a centrist? | My bad G | Man, that whole McGraw-Hill/Texas thing did a lot of damage back in the day. | We‚Äôre millennials and he thought the exact same. He thought it was a mythical creature. I personally don‚Äôt understand with all the nature documentaries that were around back in the day but I guess not everybody is into animals as much as I am. | ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been to math camp. I‚Äôve been to soccer camp. I‚Äôve been to cheerleading camp. Oh! Here‚Äôs one I haven‚Äôt been to before! Concentration‚Ä¶ sounds fun!‚Äù | Man, you should've seen that guy's face when the coffee spilled. He was all dressed up in a fancy suit and I get the feeling he was used to being on the bully end of the bully spectrum. | There is a hill on 6th avenue and there was a construction guy with a wheelbarrow full of cement, well long story short, it got out of control and went barrelling downhill.  You see, she was walking downhill and it swept her up on the way. she was wearing a sundress and no underwear.  I was walking uphilll when I saw this thing coming full speed at me, so I decided to try and stop it with my powerful erection.  Unfortunately, I missed the wheelbarrow and it scooped me right on top! my dick just ended up inside her since I already had it out.  We hit a bunch of bumps after that which is why I repeatedly inserted it. | ""What, what if there's an explanation for this shit?"" -- Dr. Dre

""What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?"" -- Eminem | I wasn't the subject of it I just knew somebody who thought cheating is an accidental thing | Still different person | The first i can not explain. And i won't ever bring it up to him or friends cause yeah it is what it is. 

The 2nd is cause of our very cult christian population we have locally who deny any form of sextalk. And this is the result of it. | Possible that he mixed them up. I never bothered to bring it up. | I had a boss with the same viewpoint. His exact words were 'you have no reason to be depressed if you live in the United States. There are people living on dirt floors without access to clean water that find a way to be happy, so people over here have nothing to be sad about'. He genuinely thought depression was just a bunch of bullshit crybabies. | My theory is that the issue emerges from the fact that the term ""depression"" has both a specific and non-specific meaning that are very similar. Non-specific referring to just general melancholy and sadness. Like a movie can be depressing. Or a really cloudy and rainy weather can be depressing. A story can be depressing. 

So that can make it difficult for some people to really understand the difference between the common term and the clinical term. | I get this a lot with my anxiety. I have Generalised Anxiety Disorder and I've had a lot of people say ""everyone gets anxious sometimes"" and then tell me I just need to try and not worry so much. | Im saying that they should make the decision to hug someone or not they shouldn't just have to because there family ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | It's important to teach kids from a young age that nobody should force them to do anything with their body without their consent. It's a way to keep them from getting molested (which usually is done by family members, you know, the people you're saying they should be forced to hug). | It means so much to me if my niece hugs me.

It means more that I respect her ability to decide if she wants to be touched or not. She is a human and not just a prop for other people's feelings. | At my last job interview I politely declined to shake hands because I was getting over a cold. I have been working there 14 months, so I think it was fine? | Nah it's there body, they shouldn't be forced to hug anyone. If they want to hug grandma okay, but if they don't then they won't. | Why on earth would a hug mean a lot to grandma when it's forced? 

Would you want someone to say they love you when they don't, just because you forced them to? | Yours is, unfortunately, quite an old fashioned view.

Kids aren‚Äôt property, to do with as you please.

Neither are they dogs, to be trained and disciplined.

By all means, explain how their behaviour will be interpreted. Tell them grandma will be hurt or upset. Explain about politeness and etiquette.

But you absolutely don‚Äôt make them. Ever. | It may mean a lot to grandma. But respecting your child‚Äôs autonomy, and respecting their boundaries will also mean a lot to the child. 

Of course children and adults have different expectations, but why, if we are to respect when an adult doesn‚Äôt want to be touched, should we not respect a child‚Äôs decision. 

Also, I feel that if we allow children to advocate for their boundaries and respect them from a young age, they will be more likely to grasp and respect the boundaries of others, as well as feel more confident in scenarios where they want to say no. | Does grandma deserve a hug?  If gram gram is a good old lady, she‚Äôll prolly get all the hugs‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think anyone deserves physical contact simply by existing as a certain status.  If my stepson didn‚Äôt wanna hug me, I‚Äôd ask if there is a form of greeting he‚Äôs comfortable with, but I‚Äôm not gonna force him to hug me because I NEED a hug for my love of him to be valid‚Ä¶ | Yeah. Forcing kids to hug abusive grandparents just not to hurt grandma's feelings is so worth it.* 

Teach kids bodily autonomy and empathy and let them decide if they want to hug the grandparents. 

*I was forced to spend holidays with my psychopathically abusive paternal grandparents and forced to hug my rapist and his accomplice for years after he'd confessed to keep family ""peace."" It wasn't until my parents found out that Grandma was also complicit that I was able to stop seeing them and having to hug them. Don't force your kids to do things they are uncomfortable doing to maintain your peace.* | No. Kids deserve autonomy over their own body and grandma can be an adult and get over it. | A lot of people don‚Äôt do handshakes. Especially after Covid. Your edit makes no sense. Most rational people aren‚Äôt going to not hire you if you say ‚Äú sorry, handshakes aren‚Äôt my thing. ‚Äú 

I couldn‚Äôt imagine someone going into a job interview, having an amazing resume, and overall just being a great fit for the job. And the hiring manager saying ‚Äú screw all that. He‚Äôs not getting the job because he no shake my hand :-( ‚Äú


(And if that was the case, they‚Äôre probably doing me a favour by not hiring me. Because I wouldn‚Äôt want to work with someone if they‚Äôre unreasonable  enough to have a handshake be a make or break factor.) 
 
is there situations where physical contact may be the norm? of course. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that everyone is going to want to follow those norms. 


if you have an issue with the concept that not everyone is cool with being touched, and further, that everyone has the right to refuse physical contact for any reason, you may be the problem‚Ä¶..


But yeah. TLDR: your edit is ridiculous. Nice cope tho! | Fun fact, I do, in fact, deny hand shakes. I don't like touching people, and if someone touches me, I won't be able to focus on anything other than the feeling of them touching me for a few hours. I have OCD. Even if I didn't, literally no one cares. It's weird that you think someone in an authority position can FORCE you to touch them. I currently am in a high paid professional position, but I've been in very high level positions, and I've never shaken anyone's hand. I just say ""Sorry, I don't do hand shakes."" And literally no one has ever cared. No one can force you to touch them, dude. That's not okay for you to believe. | Bodily autonomy is important for everyone, even children and its good to teach them from a young age.
Ps i dislike touching people and so have never shaken an interviewers hand, was gainfully employed right up until i literally became too crippled to work | An adult shaking hands in a job interview is not the same thing as teaching an impressionable young child that they owe anyone physical affection, even when they don't want to give it. | My take: a kid can deny a hug, but should definitely shake hands or do another hello/ goodbye ritual. It's okay to not be a hugger, but family members deserve an acknowledgment. | Damn I really agreed with this until I read the comments. Sorry I think ur wrong on this one. | I live with my grandsons‚Äô family, so of course they‚Äôre used to me. The other grandmother visited when they were little, and they were in a weird mood so they hid when she tried to give them hugs. Unfortunately, she was very angry about this instead of letting them warm up to her. I was pretty torn about that. Yes, of course they shouldn‚Äôt be forced to hug people, but come on, it‚Äôs their grandmother! We all got over it. | Holy hell am I surprised by the downvotes. How fuckin soft are parents these days. No wonder kids are so disrespectful now. | Oof, i thought it was just him. Concerning to know that this belief is possibly more widespread than i originally thought. Bet that was a fun conversation to have. | Ha, thanks. I had to really examine where the relationship was going after this conversation. | Blimey, she thought the blood was just flowing from her veins etc out of her body? One has to wonder if she was ever educated previously on what a period actually is.¬† | A zero balance will slightly harm your credit (probably a single digit decrease like a hard inquiry would do), so they say you should try to carry a small balance. She probably heard that and mangled it into ""don't put a lot of money towards your credit card"" or something like that. The rationale behind it is that if you never use your available credit, the bank won't make any money off of you, so they view it as a negative thing for you to always have a $0 balance. | Lol, it's amazing what crazy things people hear, and they just run with it. | It depends. A 90% balance is not great for your score, but a 10% balance won't hurt it much, if at all. The impact is in ranges, so 10% and 20% are virtually the same, whereas 20% and 40% are different. I think it's also based on your total credit utilization rather than on an account by account basis. | It can be a diagnosis and a legitimate condition without being inherently bad, like autism is. Also I‚Äôm not sure what idea you have of ADHD but it‚Äôs not just a short attention span, it‚Äôs inability to regulate attention/focus. Before I was on medication I could and did spend hours focusing on a single task‚Ä¶ at absolute random, at the cost of doing things like eating and sleeping, even when I wanted to stop and knew I had to stop. And not just attention-grabbing or fun tasks like video games, I once spent four hours deep cleaning my kitchen without being able to stop. In what way do you think advertising to children caused that? | It's the latter in my buddy 's case.
He once studied machine engineering. 
He is smart, but obviously, this didn't stop him from falling for idiocy. | I genuinely think the second explanation is the problem in the majority of cases. | Sounds about what all the aluminium hats are doing.
It certainly appears like a cult. | In his case, the wall was discovering TikTok and such.
With all the alu hat videos. | I said friend of 40 years and meant I know him that long, but that's not really relevant.  Just FYI. English is my third language, so, sorry for the mistakes I made. | I definitely would not believe you. Because wtf.

See, it did rot your brain. lol | Raspberry and Acorn are ABSOLUTELY living their best lives now. I don't think I've seen Raspberry smile as much as she has in the past 10 months (since the breakup).

Raspberry's new man is clean (doesn't drink or do drugs) is kind, sweet, and genuinely treats the women around him like people. 

Apple in the meanwhile is 'accidentally' sending me and my friend Tangerine texts that he's code-word 'joining the mafia' because (his words): 'No one's waiting for him anymore, so he's good for whatever the job is'. Like, we're not stupid, we know it's a fake text. 

What a fucking loser he is. | You're the kind of villain we all need. | After the breakup, Apple told me and our other mutual friend Tangerine, that he was going to un-alive himself on his birthday. He tortured me and Tangerine for two months telling us what he was gonna do. He'd send voice-clips of him screaming wanting to 'end the pain', revving the car engine, and saying he was 'going to wrap his car around a fucking tree'. He sent us cryptic images (on the day of his birthday, a plain black photo with a hand making the 'peace' sign), etc. Literally everything under the sun that he could do to freak people out that he was going to end things.   


And so his birthday came and went 5 months ago. He's still here, and apparently as pathetic as ever. Both Tangerine and I went no-contact after he pulled that shit on us for 2 months. | This is dangerous advice. Some dogs are ok with a few grapes. Some get real fucked up from a single grape. And you never know how your dog will react; it's NOT size dependent like chocolate or other toxins. I'm not a veterinary professional but I worked in animal care for many years and this is what I was told by veterinarians to tell clients when the situations came up.

I'd rather give my (large) dogs a bit of chocolate than a grape or raisin. | You CAN eat raw shrimp by itself, it's a type of sashimi. But those shrimp are picked meticulously and prepared in a specific way to make sure no one gets sick. I eat shrimp sashimi all the time at my local sushi bar but I trust them. | Ceviche isn‚Äôt really raw.  The marinade denatures the shrimp, which essentially cooks it without heat.

But the process doesn‚Äôt destroy pathogens the way that cooking with heat does, so it‚Äôs important to start with safe, quality seafood | I wonder if that‚Äôs a specialty thing then because we were not allowed to serve raw shellfish at this American place. | What's their cycle like then | Bwahaha.

And why specifically csharp edges? | Well you *can*.  Your results may vary though... | On a somewhat similar note, I argued with my dad about microwaving certain types of plastics before

He put a plastic cup with leftovers (?) I think in the microwave, the cup MELTED, and he still said it‚Äôd be fine to eat ü´† | This depends on the Styrofoam. Check for a microwave safe label on it, most restaurants with Styrofoam takeout boxes these days will use microwave safe Styrofoam.

That said, even knowing the risks, I've chanced it with the carcinogenic type before. | My coworker was indignant that her leftovers melted through the container in the microwave. I was like, ""Yeah, it does that"" | Hmmm i had a set of dishes that had a thin strip of some type of metal foil applied around the outside edge. Used those dushes for probably 10yrs in the same microwave with no damage to the microwave.  There would be the occassion spark and ""snapping"" noise but best  could tell the dishes were never damaged either. | They grounded it.  Quite literally, the glass plate is now slightly conductive, and the metal walls are designed to carry currents away.

The argument was based on the assumption that you're in a normal ass house with all the plumbing on one side. | No we took that into account.

The argument was assuming there was no cramped toilet, and if there was, it was on the side with the plumbing in the shower. | The argument was making the assumption that either there was no toilet crammed in next to the tub, or if there was, it was on the same wall as the shower plumbing. | you're probably obsessed with him more if you feel the need to check someone's comment history based off one objectively true comment | Obsessed with saving democracy! | Yep | Why do americans not include tax on price tags.

Grapes are one of the healthiest things you can eat. | Yeah this reveals she's ignorant and trashy. | Totally. I'm pro-choice but I understand the pro-life argument, I just disagree. I can't believe there are people who don't understand the nuance of the pro-life argument. It's like they never thought about it and reject it without a second thought. | It‚Äôs so disingenuous to paint all of them as if their one true objective is some misogynistic goal to ‚Äúcontrol women‚Äù. Many of them truly believe murder is wrong, hopefully as do you, and believe that that fetus is a person as deserving of life as you or me. I guarantee the people I‚Äôm talking about would want it outlawed if men were the ones getting pregnant.

Do *some* of them have misogynistic motivations or beliefs? Certainly. Do *all* of them? No. | I guess there's folks out there that think animals are people too so I guess I shouldn't be surprised. | Can't murder what hasn't been born | Not sure if you understand what statistics mean.

Second, knowing how to swim can save you from the possibility that you might watch someone drown while being unable to help them. Third, because it's EASY. it's literally the easiest life skill to learn. You were born knowing how to float. | You're hurt in the water, tired and barely able to keep above the water and you see someone 20ft away and they are just watching you struggle to keep your head above the water.

""Help me"" you keep trying to yell to them but every time you do it tires you out more and your mouth dips below the water causing you to swallow more water.

""Why the fuck aren't you helping me, I'm going to drown you fuck!"" You keep thinking...

The person watching you yells ""omg don't drown, I can't swim! I called 911, don't drown till they get here!""

Or some other scenario like a flash flood happens downtown Toronto, or a hurricane rips through Texas and causes flooding and you watch your loved ones sink because they never learned to swim. | Googling ""desert flood"" shows it's pretty dangerous.

But he went on about it being a deceiving word since it was of German origin. | that‚Äôs what my coworker asked as soon as he walked away. like sir, ya ever been to a restaurant before??? | Colorado, United States. I've definitely seen people just say fuck it and go through a light when it was red if no one was coming, but this guy was legitimately confused and just would not or could not grasp the concept of it not being legal to go through an intersection during a red light. | She was so dumb. This is one of many instances. She was meannnnnnn too. I remember her calling a kid the r slur bc he was in a wheelchair. She cheated her way to not be dropped out. | Yes being projected from earth like a light, he called it a plasma ball. He showed me a YouTube video explaining the idea and none of it made sense. The video sounded like my schizophrenic friends journal but this guy was convinced it was true. | I really wish this was taught in school

As soon as I started making real money with my wife I did a deep dive into taxes (mostly to figure out if I could pay less)

Probably one of the best personal finance topics I‚Äôve researched simply to know other than maybe budgeting. | [Jesus can look like anybody!](https://youtu.be/TYND5fkqhT0?si=yMw92REW82cUoVly&t=40) | Seriously??

That Pic someone drew, with animals surrounding a tree & the caption read ""If you keep rating animals on their ability to climb a tree. You'll forever think some animals are stupid"". Think a fish, it can't even breathe out of water & a monkey would probably drown if it tried to swim across the Nile. But it was at the top of the tree.¬†¬† | Pretty much | It's never worked that way. Take the average of 1, 1, 1, 1, 10 and tell me how many of the numbers that make up that average end up being below average. Then there's the fact that a number of people will be of exactly average intelligence, so there's no real way you would get half above and half below. | Most places run checks electronically these days and it works the same as using your debit card, money comes out right away and will be declined for insufficient funds. Just depends on where you're trying to use them. | Used to be that way, but at least in the US most checks are electronically processed at payment, so if the money ain‚Äôt there the check ain‚Äôt goin through. | I did.

Her manipulating just hit a final breaking point. | My budget is for office supplies, not food :D | Well, it was four times in the same week, but yes.

We're living in a dystopia. | Lol‚Ä¶ yeah I didn‚Äôt explain it. I was half asleep when I commented. He didn‚Äôt believe that there was a single person called the pope that led the Catholic church. He thought the pope was like Santa Claus. I‚Äôd show him web sites, he still didn‚Äôt believe it. He‚Äôd say that‚Äôs some guy just out performing and they were covering the pope as a feel good story. Here‚Äôs Wikipedia, won‚Äôt even look at it. 

I told my department head (who was Catholic) to tell him and instead he said not everyone has to believe in the pope. Lol, dick. So that only fueled it. 

This guy looked like the yellow troll guy from Sin City. He wasn‚Äôt right in the head, but somehow he was hired to teach CSCI. He was just so disinterested in anything that wasn‚Äôt computer programming or Disney. Anything else and he was a complete drooling moron.

ETA: also, I‚Äôm an atheist. | No to my dumb friend lol

I was just mentioning I have chickens so I can easily take a picture and show them but they insist it's doctored. | They used to teach and in some cases still teach wild things, and in the future when more knowledge is updated, it will prove even more things wrong.
But that isn't the point, the point is the fact, it is not dairy. | I was talking to myself, while imagining him in front of me | I worded it very badly. Let me elaborate.

I had a housemate who would leave dishes to MOULD as he was a severe hoarder. He'd then rinse them off after about a month and put them in the cupboard as if nothing ever happened. We could see specks of gunk.

Hoarding is a mental illness, I get that, but I would have been a lot more accepting if he washed the dishes properly when he finally emerged from his room. 10 seconds of water to slide off the main chunk of mould is not enough. | Yes, thank you! I tried to explain the left to right thing and she refused to believe me. | Nope, just leave it there until everything is fully dehydrated and inedible. | > parents with blue eyes can have children with brown eyes

This is true. Both my parents have blue eyes and I have two blue eyes, and one brown eye. | Search for shark, battery and Trump and prepare to continue to not know what I‚Äôm talking | How would a phone not affect mental health? | Civil, friendly,  and thought provoking  is not the description  of an argument. That sounds more like discussion  and constructive  communication,  not an argument. | He was calling multiple goldfish ""fishes"" | No, he's saying that's what the argument was about. | That was the argument. He was saying the sun was the hottest planet in the solar system. He didn‚Äôt believe me when I said the sun isn‚Äôt a planet | You are indeed correct and apparently I‚Äôm the stupid one ü§¶ | I‚Äôm not voting to continue the genocide either | You‚Äôre a sad person.

You can argue this til the end of time. Youll say what youll say. Im not wasting my breath on you or anyone else. Like i said. Especially online.  Everyone is a troll. Take what i said as my opinon..  You dont like it. Move on. Im not arguing with you or anyone else.  I did many times in the past. Its such a waste of time and energy to do so online.  Everyone is anonymous. Who the fuck cares what i think or you think.  Im not running for office.

And Earth is flat. Those people drive me to drink. | Bro was NOT in the Truman show üíÄ | I think this is an offshoot of flat earthers. Bonkers, all of them. | And what's holding up the dome? | Ya, this is fairly common in the ""flat earther"" community. We're enclosed by an ice wall and a big dome or some stupid bs. | They're fireflies. Fireflies that, uh... got stuck up on that big bluish-black thing. | ü§£ I‚Äôd ask what he thought was past that but I‚Äôm assuming he didn‚Äôt think that far | I saw your first comment and knew he was a flat earther. These people are not only nutty, they're fully delusional. I met a guy who wouldn't stop going on about it and when I asked him why the government would lie about it he said it was ""a means to control."" I was like ""isn't religion? Money? Politics? All the other actual means to control more effective?"" and he was like ""see the educated people never listen.""

I felt like I was part of a weird comedy bit. | And...dare I ask what they thought was beyond the dome and lights? | Sounds like the flat earthers theory | I've encountered this exact thing, the guy was an older Indian Muslim... I explained the planets to him and he looked at me like I was insane.

Other than that, normal guy, normal intelligence... I don't get it. | This is standard flat earth insanity. | Like...the Astrodome? | ‚Ä¶and on the other side of the dome? | What did they think is on the other side of the dome? | Not entirely wrong. | And what did he think was above the dome? What powered the lights? 

The mental gymnastics needed for such a belief are astounding. | Was he American by any chance? | Worked with a well educated dude who was a hardcore flat earther also believing this | So basically a flat earther. That‚Äôs typically what they believe. And let me guess, they were Christian? | But what is beyond the dome?! | Were they an ancient Egyptian time traveller? | That's called a flat earther | Apparently we can do that but the street I live on still has potholes years later. Lol | Ok but then what is on the other side of the dome? Because even if you say nothing that would still be outer space | But what did he think was behind the dome?!? Another dome? Or (gasp) maybe space? | I was so sad when the young guy conducting his laser experiment at the end proved that earth was curved, but he concluded that the experiment failed. It was actually such a good experiment, and he has so much potential, but... | Made me laugh.  Thank you. | All the ones I've met have used weird biblical arguments that frankly seem taken out of context. | I'm not sure it's more people than ever, but they sure are louder than they've been in centuries.

I'm also 99% sure that about half of the loud ones don't really believe it and spew that stuff for clout/cash. | Ahh, but ""they"" use this technology to conceal The Truth‚Ñ¢ from us. | I thought it was a funny movie. | Nah not at all, he's genuinely one of the nicest, well mannered and motivated people I know. It's honestly bizzare. | I guess. I argued with them once when I was super early for a flight, and it was mind numbingly frustrating and took forever to get a supervisor who confirmed that Albuquerque, New Mexico was indeed a domestic destination requiring only a ticket and government issued ID. From then on, I always started with my license or government work ID, but handed over my passport without comment on request. | That's how I read it as well. Airport being staffed by yet another kids left behind. | Airport employees can literally be as dumb as they want and it doesn‚Äôt matter. You‚Äôre a captive audience and have to deal with them to make it to your destination. Airlines and TSA will just make up rules and skirt them or enforce them totally at personal will. It‚Äôs actually incredible what airline employees can get away with compared to literally any other industry AND they get repeatedly bailed out by the government even during all this.

Last month I flew Delta and saw two TSA agents absolutely screaming in the face of a woman in a wheelchair who was being pushed by OTHER employees. They decided they‚Äôd lecture her for trying to cut the line for security when‚Ä¶.other employees were the ones who pushed her up there. Entire security line was eye fucking the tsa agents but nothing will ever be done. | Ok, I'm gonna need you to back up for a sec, hillbillies in Florida?

WW2 led to the cold war which led to proxy wars in the middle east. | [Like these signs on flags?](https://www.disneyfanatic.com/neo-nazis-activity-has-increased-in-florida-rl1/) | I mean, right now because the Russia invaded Ukraine, the prices of electricity and other power sourced went through the roof, because of 80% of the developed world used Russian gas. | I disagree, there's a large number of countries where people did not feel the shocks, and that's doubly true for the descendants two or three generations down.

I'm not Italian lol | Hilarious | Depends what it is that‚Äôs going a mile a minute to be fair üòÇ | Up until 200 years ago, 6 mph was indeed crazy fast. | It's not really used as a vehicular speed though. Like ""they were talking a mile a minute"" your jaw moving one mile in one minute is pretty fast. | 60 mph IS fast, it just isn't quite fast enough to be fun. | I think that dawned on me back in like 3rd or 4th grade. Not long after a friend had the same realization and we were both disappointed that going ‚Äúa mile a minute‚Äù wasn‚Äôt all that fast. | Well, *running* (or even biking) a mile in a minute would indeed be crazy fast. | When I first got my driver's license in high school, a friend of mine who started driving around the same time was freaking out because he thought his 35 mpg car meant that he had to go to the gas station 35 times a day to fill it up lmao | Now try going a mile a second. | Right up until about 200 years ago, the fastest thing on the have of the planet was a horse. And 200 years is less than the length of an eye blink in human history. | Right up until about 200 years ago, the fastest thing on the have of the planet was a horse. And 200 years is less than the length of an eye blink in human history. | Mile a minute vertically is impressive | A Mile a minute may sound slow, but have you considered traveling 1.6 kilometres a minute? | It used to be a lot | It's pretty fast if your sprinting? Or falling. | I felt the same way when I finished my first mile run in a minute. | There was a point in the not so distant past that going a mile a minute was considered very fast.

Jay Leno has a bit about it. | I think a lot of us are just now rationalizing how dated that saying is. | Reality is often... disappointing | I mean....60mph isn't exactly *slow* if you're stationary and the thing moving is 2 tons of steel. | I mean, 60 mph for us is incredibly fast. Up until rather recently like last 100 years our primary method of locomotion was our chevrolegs. The real fast stuff was horses and ships.... A horses average speed in a sprint is 30 MPH and that horse will die way before you reached any meaningful destination. Ships, in fair seas, and favorable winds were getting like 12 knots which is like 15 or 16 mph?


Anyways, nah I get what you are saying. If I am going down the interstate 60mph might as well be walking lol. I always try to remind myself of context though when I am raging in traffic that I am only going 15 mph but like .... That's still faster than most of human history has averaged lol. | To be fair, 60mph would be considered very fast if you ask any person who lived before cars and trains were invented | Imagine how long we've used horses, not even able to break over 45 mph for thousands of years. You shouldn't even run a horse at the maximum recorded horse speed at 44 mph for an extended period of time. Now this steel beast can subsist on a very excitable liquid and break 60 mph for hours on end? Now you can just use classic electricity to break 60 mph in disturbingly quiet luxury for a few hours with a good load of camping goodies? Technology really has come so far. | It's an old saying, cars were slower then | 11 million miles a minute sounds fast but... Not astoundingly so, until you realise that's light speed. | I sometimes like to remind myself when I'm driving how fast I'm actually going

Like coming off the motorway back onto residential roads and it feels like I'm going extremely slow at 30mph I say to myself ""Don't forget you're still going faster than any human being has ever run, and someone sprinting into you fucking hurts"" | I was about 12 when I figured it out, probably thanks to 6th grade word problems in math 

I went somewhere with my uncle who was notorious for having a lead foot. When I got home, my mother was quizzing me so I told her: oh ya he was going fast, like a mile a minute. She freaked out, it started to concern me so I gave her a condescending look and reminded her that it was 60 mph

I thought I was hilarious, she thought I was an asshole | But doesn‚Äôt escape velocity change depending on when the engines turn off?

Ie. If the engines burn longer, can‚Äôt a slower escape velocity be used? | Thank you, this was the first thing I thought of when I saw that comment lmao | Speed is exact.  The problem is it isn't like that irl.  People have to stop and go due to traffic.  People can't shake their perceptions of reality with actual factual concepts due to the fact, reality has too many factors that affect the facts.

60mile per hr in a straight line =/= actually going from NYC to new jersey in one hour. | Speedometers are just a suggestion | I know people that think two cars can both be going 60 mph, but if one has turbo or a souped up engine it will reach the destination first. | Omg, you cant make this up, incredible and somehow so credible in the same time | Dude, what she was saying was her own experience likely and she couldn't articulate that she means sometimes there may a slowdown or a red light or whatever lol

People are just amazingly stupid / stupidly amazing  üòÜü§£ | > I had the same conversation but my friend was convinced you couldn‚Äôt be exactly sure every time.

This just made me actually laugh out loud. That's so funny. | The problem is, once you nail down the speed, you no longer know where you are. (Just an uncertainty principle joke) | Does she constantly take over an hour to get to work? 

And yes, I am calling her slow | I didn't mean to make anyone feel lesser here - we're all different and process things differently! | A little less. Normal cruising speed for commercial planes is around 550mph.¬† | With cars I find the concept easy but with planes it gets a little more confusing. Is this the engine speed of the plane or is it accounting for the fact that the earth is spinning below the plane as well? | If you go 1 mile per minute, that means after one minute, you will have gone 1 mile. You will have gone 10 miles in 10 minutes. And you will have gone 60 miles in 60 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so going 60 miles in 60 minutes, means you‚Äôre going 60 miles an hour | 60 miles per hour is literally covering 60 miles in one hour.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so if you divide 60 miles per hour to get one minute's worth of travel, it's one mile!

(I get people are different at processing things too - good on you for thinking it out.  HOpe that helps) | And if it takes 45 seconds (which is 3/4 of a minute) to go a mile, then you are traveling at 60/(3/4) = 60 x (4/3) = 80 mph. | Yeah- that I can grasp. | Edit: The conversions below this edit are wrong. At 75mph then 1 mile takes 48 seconds, not 45 seconds. Using a baseline of 15 seconds per quarter mile is fine for estimates, but if you need exact times, the conversions are different.

Close.

45 minutes is 3/4 of 1 hour. An hour is 4 quarters of 15 minutes. So if a mile takes 45 seconds, that means you are going 25% faster so you'd be going 75 mph.

Using 60mph to equal out to 1 mile per minute is handy for give time estimates on the highway. | Dyscalculia here, they lost me at the second sentence. You can teach me all the concepts you like, but the more numbers you expect me to remember or convert, the less chance there is that I'll retain that information. My brain physically cannot make those connections. | That if you go twice as fast it takes half the time? I thought more fast=less time is how people usually think of speed... | Idaho and Iowa for me and I've been to both. I have to stop and think corn or potatoes? | Ohio:  Sucks

Iowa: Meh | I was going to try to mash this into some kind of ""Kokomo"" bastard but no dice... | Oklahomans üòä | I've never been to Hawa'ii but I've read that there are organizations that cater to that specific need. No idea if it's true, the internet being the internet. | ""Or babies, it's ... just too early to tell. I'm so sorry."" | Preganonant? | If only the poor woman had a Luigi board. | You‚Äôre assuming they can read the bible and understand what ‚Äúlay with‚Äù means | the person op was talking about prob was doing the deed while pregnant aswell | Stupid maybe, but clearly nobody else told her. | Well obvs | Maybe, but if she never had sex before marriage, and now she and her husband are having frequent sex and she's getting pregnant frequently, she might just believe that now that she's married, God is giving them babies.

There have been a few people who have admitted that as children they used to believe that it was marriage or the husband and wife merely lying down together that made babies before they learned otherwise, and if no one taught the woman otherwise, that may have been the explanation that stayed with her. | It usually takes a few weeks to figure out you're pregnant after the sex that causes it - maybe longer if you're not using pregnancy tests and only realise you're pregnant a couple of months in. In that time she will have done a lot of other things with her husband. Had dinner. Cuddled. Kissed. Danced together, maybe. If she believes as many people do that children are God's blessing, then why would she make the connection with that specific one of many loving acts she and her husband are doing together? | But what if a baby is not understood to be a result of anything?? Maybe she has sex every week since age 14 and there‚Äôs no way to connect the two? | I don‚Äôt think they do, it‚Äôs just instinct. | They didn‚Äôt specify the country, there are literally uncontacted tribes in Brazil. Not everyone went to high school or has an iPhone. | If you are not taught something then that's not a stupidity issue. If you were taught and still don't get it, then it's a stupidity issue. Albert einstein would not be able to figure out how to create a folder on a modern laptop on his own, and that does not make him stupid. That woman never being taught sexual education does not make her stupid. If she's constantly pregnant that makes it really hard to figure out that the sex is causing it. Its not like she was absitnent until one day, then got pregnant and never figured it out. She was 40 with 17 kids. She probably had more pregnancies than periods.

I cannot believe I have to explain this to someone on a thread about having to explain basic shit to people. | No, not at all | Many Mom just liked to fuck, who can blame? Me no. | Depends on where you live. Honestly, I don't remember the connection being said explicitly. We raised animals, so I knew. | They don‚Äôt. | Dammit Auto! You have herpes! | [deleted] | It's gross if you think about it that long but one in six people have herpes..... You can just only spread it when you have an outbreak.... And a lucky few won't ever even have an outbreak!!

(no herpes here yay giving birth) | Thanks mitch | Believe it or not, I had two different guys treat me like a leper when I disclosed that I get cold sores.

I mean, you can decide not to date someone with cold sores -- I think it's stupid, but you do you -- but the way they reacted, you'd think I told them I had a raging case of Ebola. | I read 80% of the population has HSV1 or 2, and of that group, 80% never have symptoms (but can still transmit it, which is why many parents are strict with others kissing their babies especially because it can be much more dangerous (fatal) to infants) | Various types of herpes are super common. But also, not all herpes is what people think of as herpes, so some people may say something but mean another. Herpes is a virus group that includes what causes cold sores and what causes genital warts but also includes varicella-zoster or chicken pox / shingles. | From generic online search:

Cold sores
Cold sores are not a genetic condition, but genes can affect how often someone gets cold sores after being infected with the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Some people may not have the right genes to handle the virus as well as others. 
 
Genital herpes
Genital herpes is not hereditary, but HSV-2 can be passed from mother to baby during birth or sometimes in-utero. 
 
HHV-6
In less than 1% of adults, the HHV-6 virus can insert its DNA into the human genome, which can be passed on to offspring if the insertion is present in the parent's eggs or sperm. 
 
Most adults carry at least one form of herpes virus, and the first outbreak is usually the most severe. After the initial outbreak, there may not be another flare-up for months or not at all. | Not everyone, but approx 60-80% of the adult population. Older you are, the more likely you are to have at least one strain. Most carriers are asymptomatic or extremely rarely symptomatic. | It‚Äôs true | What? Please tell me you‚Äôre joking. Or being sarcastic. | You heard wrong. | Depends how much Red Bull they‚Äôve consumed | You'd have to wait around till the trucks come to take them back to the farm, and that might be days. | I mean most airlines probably won't let you but if you had a private plane with the carry capacity, I'm sure you could. | Anything can fly if you have a big enough trebuchet*

Reindeer meat is *very* lean, barely any fat at all, and also quite fibrous. It may get dry and tough in many dishes where you usually would use beef or pork.

I do for example occasionally make reindeer burgers, but they get better a little bit of pork fat or milk fat mixed in, to bring out the meat's own flavors, and keep the burgers from getting too dry.

For some specific dishes and preparations, reindeer is way better meat than beef, but in others, the other way around. | really? the Caribou I had was absolutely AMAZING | Do you call the homeless Reindeer? | I have an adopted reindeer there!

There‚Äôs no way she actually thought that. | Same species 

Reindeer are a semidomesticated *sub*species of Rangifer, and there are many subspecies of both reindeer and caribou in Alaska. | And without considerable travel the average person isn't going to view a narwal skeleton or taxidermy. | Someone I knew did that once, in his mom's minivan, with no license.

r/woooosh | Nope I'm from Pennsylvania,  but iv also heard that acronym before üòÇ | This is laughable since one function of the sign is to get people to stop so that they can see if there is other traffic coming before they cross into the road... | Marketing team: ""Our analysis showed that other people's stupidity was the problem with our marketing campaign. It's all good, yo."" | :::sigh:::: the stupid seems to persist.  Don‚Äôt know why I was surprised. Interesting article. | I can't help but take this with a grain of salt. Did it fail because THAT many people thought that, or did people just prefer McDonald's? It doesn't help that the only study done on this was performed by... A&W themselves. | It's not true, honestly.  The original ‚Äúsource‚Äù for the cause of the A&W third-pounder‚Äôs failure is a book by the former owner, Alfred Taubman, in which he says after it failed they hired a marketing firm to find out why it failed. The firm came to the conclusion ‚ÄúAmericans are bad at math‚Äù after doing a few focus groups.

https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/28745/did-aw-customers-think-1-3-pound-burger-patties-weigh-less-than-1-4-pound-ones | >Despite the confusion, Taubman took an important lesson from the experience: ""Sometimes the messages we send to our customers through marketing and sales information are not as clear and compelling as we think they are.""

My important lesson would be, ""People are fucking dumb.""  But I can see how that wouldn't fly with customers and investors. | They should have tried marketing the 1/8th lbs burger. | For most burgers, 1/3 - 3/8 lb is the perfect meat to bun and toppings ratio in my opinion. A 1/2 pound is too much, a 1/4 is too little | Yes, 1/4 of the time they're like this, but I wish it was only 1/3 of the time. | I think the spread is fascinating. We have engineers the figured out how to improvise a carbon dioxide filter on Apollo 13 using only the contents on board the vessel. Then we have this lady. | A person is smart

People are dumb | No, no... Most of the time they're like this. | I don't know I feel pretty amazed tbh | Well, idk I kinda get this. Like it's two patties whereas ""half pounder"" sounds more like it's just one bigger patty. Probably not a major distinction but maybe some people would prefer two smaller patties to one big patty, if that makes sense? Like I get that it still would be two patties regardless of what they call it, but I could see how someone would be confused over that. | It's not a half pound burger. It's two 1/4 pound burgers in one sandwich. | Double is bigger than half! | Or Double Royale. | üé∂You down with QPP?üé∂ | A double royal with cheese | Royale With Cheese | Yes, the imperial system is so flawed, fractions are a specialty for the learned. 
No fractions in metric, its use would better suit the maths challenged public!

And now we are going to have arguments about the metric system we shouldn‚Äôt need to have‚Ä¶. | I swear, I was the only person buying those angus third pounders. They were real good! | It‚Äôs actually 0.5 because it‚Äôs a 20 minute period, followed by a 20 minute intermission, and then half the second period. | That logic would have gotten her closer to a half pound at least.¬† | I saw a popular Podcaster saying a quarter to 11 e.g can't be 10:45. He had a whole speech. LOL even his fellow hosts just looked at him.¬† | You're hurting my brain with this nonsense | Excuse me, but we don't use those commie metric units here in Murica! | i woke my dog up laughing üò≠ apologize to him | they cant even read clocks anymore bro | Sounds like American units tbh. | I‚Äôll also add that this was an employee who was not trained to work at the deli. In fact, she said it was her first day, and they just threw her into the deli with zero training (at this particular store, the deli is rarely open anymore because they can‚Äôt staff it). I never saw her at the store ever again. | Eh, in the deli, the scale usually prints out the price tag -- so if it recorded only 0.30 lbs, it would only charge for 0.30 lbs, even if the worker thought it was 0.5. It's unlikely the customer was being overcharged for what they actually got, it's just that they wanted more. | >and they vote.

Every fucking time | And they unfortunately breed | Think of the average joe. Most of the time we think of ol Average Joe as a fairly stupid person. 

Now remember that that's Average Joe which puts him at about the 50% marker.

50% of people are stupider than the average person. 

I'll never look at life the same again. | Lol I made a similar comment before I even saw this one. I'm glad someone else is suffering with me | This is pretty much why voting for equality of outcome makes no sense | This is why I don't vote | Especially on an advertisement where every burger is zoomed in on and also somehow just much.. perkier.. fluffier than irl? 

Even burgers gain 5 pounds on t.v | There‚Äôs only 1/143rd of a pound difference between a penny and a quarter. How could anyone tell the difference?

You can easily feel the relative difference if you‚Äôve got them in front of you to compare. The only reason you couldn‚Äôt observe the difference between two identical objects rightin front of you with the ability to directly compare them first hand where one is litterally a third larger and heavier, is if something is wrong with you. Like there is with the woman in question. | I kind of falsely claimed to still be a math teacher, but I specialized in math, chem, and physics as a high school sub. Eventually, I started to get kids seeking me out for help once they realized that I could bring it down to a level they needed so they could understand. It was very rewarding watching that light come on. 

But, yeah. I can teach just about anyone who WANTS to learn. | I am more impressed that the shop has loose beans. | This only works on elementary school kids, or if the other person recognizes your authority, or at least has an open mind.

Usually, the other person will get to

>Great, so, do you see that you get more beans in a third than you do in a quarter?

They will then not respond meekly with ""yes"", but will rather get angry and accuse the other party of accusing them of being stupid, and to stop trying to trick them. | Not all of them clearly, or we wouldn't have enough adults who think like this to ruin the marketing of a burger. | No, this is Patrick. | 4 is bigger than 3! 4 is smaller than 3! . I feel you. | You're a goddamn marketing genius! But, can I get it on days that AREN'T April 12? | Any multiple of 3 and 4 will work. I was just using the LCM for my ease. | I'd just go with "".33 is bigger than .25 right?"" | I don't know anything about memes. I don't even know what one is. | Some beans! | [Full Beans](https://youtu.be/p9UPEtWtV4s?si=g4TczhrHBKTmrQvm)

[Part 2](https://youtu.be/8ovmRo-xd58?si=zVr-3BJgGEwJbHkH) | I wouldn't trust that woman with my money, nor with how to divide a dollar three ways. Even if she got to 33¬¢, she'd likely say that it's not the same because there's still money left over. | Yes, but I didn't say ""12!."" I said ""12!"" | Exactly. But who says ""a third of an hour""? | My brother and I used this with flannel/plaid pattern sizing. 1 gauge was something like 2"" squares. 32 daughter was basically pinstripes both ways | Yeah, I mentioned money and time in another thread. Baking is also great. | No. It's just me projecting what I think would happen with someone who thinks they're going to correct my math. | Gold is heavier than feathers, too. They're weighed on different systems where grain measurements are different. | Because I didn't let her choose 12!. | Bulk beans, the ones you find in the bulk section. Not the ones that are already prepackaged. Prepackaged cost more most of the time. | even better to know 3rd grade math | I really hope this is sarcasm, because you're turning into the person that says the pound of steel is heavier than the pound of feathers.... | I called a pizza place one time and asked how big the 'large' pizza was

they answered: '8 slices'

fuck you | Yes, it's a very good way.  I use that often. | Ahhhh I‚Äôm pretty sure Australia‚Äôs its own condiment there, mate. | I am bc Australia has 2 Ccuntries | Obviously that is what the coworker meant and OP didn‚Äôt pick up on it. It‚Äôs incredibly common to refer to another country‚Äôs holiday that is equivalent to yours by using the name of your holiday as a stand in. | Yes, people say it tongue-in-cheek like that all the time; I understand. 

I thought I spelled it out pretty clearly that this dude thought they had a different calendar and they celebrated the same thing Americans do, but on a different day because their calendar was different. The question was about the dumbest argument. | My British husband explained to me that the Queen had different birthdays in different commonwealth countries. They just pick a day that has nice local weather and call that her birthday. I get it, but it also blew my mind a little bit to learn it. I wonder if they kept the same days to celebrate the King's birthday now that there's a new monarch... | That thread encapsulated [the idea of playing chess with a pigeon.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/11427530-arguing-with-idiots-is-like-playing-chess-with-a-pigeon) | I read the whole thing. 

What years to be in the internet were the 2000 | Aw that's fucking amazing. Haven't laughed that hard by myself in so long. It just gets progressively worse, dumber, and more aggressive. I love that entire thread. Thanks, mate. | I wonder where TheJosh is these days. And if he's still a fucking idiot. | WTF have I just read | Yes, and I regret it every day. | People. What a bunch of bastards. | I hate people | Yeah. That's why we old people have to rely on urban dictionary to keep up with all the new fangled words the new generation is coming up with these days. | Too not to lol | ""Slattern"" works too. Criminally underused. | Appeal to definition can be (note, can, I'm NOT arguing it always is) a genuine fallacy. Primarily, dictionaries don't really tell you the connotation of a word. Two words can have the same meaning on paper, but have radically different meanings in actual use.

Example, both the terms ""strong-willed"" and ""pig-headed"" mean basically the same thing - to be stubborn. But one of those has a positive connotation, while the other is almost always an insult.

Add onto that other things like context, dialects, one language not having an equivalent word in a different language, different cultures (like how cunt is used in a friendly context in Australia, but is almost strictly a misogynistic slur in the US), and you can see why an ""appeal to definition"" can be a problem in some specific circumstances

edit: making my intentions clear, I'm not stating whether the original commenter did or did not use this fallacy. I also am not saying the people they were arguing with were using it correctly. It sounds like they weren't. I just wanted to point out that yes, it can in fact be a fallacy, even if it wasn't in this instance. | it's just 'college speak' they heard something similar and thought saying something similar was an actual defense to them being wrong and upset. | Yes. 

It's both. Further up someone said people get definitions from X. Dumb people. 

People are trying to tell others that dictionaries are racist/bad/whatever. Loud dumb people. | In older times, people knew who their local village idiot was, and knew to disregard them.  Now all the village idiots can band together in forums and subreddits, and reinforce each others idiocy.  Each idiot used to only be as loud as they could yell, but now they've all got digital megaphones.  Anonymity helps people avoid the consequences of saying stupid stuff. | Stating your job title is only an appeal to authority fallacy if your job has nothing to do with the question being argued.

E.g. if someone goes ""I know more about traffic lights than you, I install them for a living"", that's likely a good argument, whereas if they were to say, ""I know more about traffic lights than you, I'm a board-certified physician"", *that* would be an appeal to authority fallacy. | rule of definitions and etymology: Definitions can be added, but never lost. | IF you've heard the people claiming the song ironic isn't ironic, unfortunately, things can be multiple things, and in this case ironic has a few meanings. One is ""Happening in the opposite way of what was expected"" and then ""Words that make one expect different from the reality"" or ""One event that happens independently from another event but still affects the other event in a way to either cause extreme disharmony (or sometimes everything falls into place too perfectly). Dramatic irony.""

As such ""a free ride when you already paid"" The free ride  would make one think you didn't pay, so since you did, it is an ironic expression.

Or ""Traffic jam when you're already late"" also follows the 'dramatic irony' defintion. You're already late, an event that happens independently of the traffic jam. The traffic jam just makes the situation you put yourself in even worse.

however, some linguists view that as not 'true irony' because they have qualifying words with them when defined. | Was she being ironic when all the examples she gave were not ironic | So close to being perfect 

>Unfortunately, you can't set it to be the default view for searches, meaning you'll have to manually choose the tab each time Google serves up an AI result. | It goes of Oxford which is why I like it | Do you mean cause and effect? | It really depends, motivated reasoning can allow for misrepresenting but if we're gauging twitter as a whole it can at least be representative of how the dominant segment on Twitter uses language.

I really wouldn't trust it to be representative of the segment the person I responded to is suggesting it's representative of anymore though. | Individual, yes. But dictionaries can only be snapshots in time and usage on social media can easily be representative of more current use. Or at least more current use in particular subcultures. | What did they major in in college | Interesting. How did your definition differ from theirs? | I remember as a kid, I had to go to work with my dad because there was no school that day.  He had one coworker he referred to as Harry Pothead.  Anyway, this guy decided to run out from the building to his truck in a very active thunderstorm with a piece of sheet metal over his head so he didn't get wet.  

I, being a child, pointing out to this grown ~40 year old adult that it was a bad idea was apparently lost on him.  My dad then spent what seemed like forever trying to explain the electrical theory this individual was supposed to know to essentially a brick wall. | Hmm. they didn't end the comment with /s. Now I have to go try it | If you hold up a metal cross you can exercise a lightning storm. The bigger the cross the better. | That's enough science for today, Mr. Franklin. Back in bed, sir. | Presence of metal makes no difference, it‚Äôs not a factor. The height and pointiness of the object are what‚Äôs important.¬† | Fun fact, metal does not attract electricity. Therefore, holding anything metal outside during a thunderstorm is relatively safe. As long as it is not the tallest object in the sky as electricity always takes the path of least resistance. | Don't forget to spread your legs while standing in iron buckets filled with salt water while insulting the Gods for greatest effect. | Time to put on full metal gear to prove you wrong | Flawless plan! | Most people have only seen trees fall in situations orchestrated by someone knowledgeable in felling trees; or in media such as cartoons or video games.  The concept they have of a tree falling is a nice neat line toppling over cleanly.  Convincing someone that their worldview is wrong is an exceptionally difficult task that gets harder the longer they've held a believe. | They are trying to get back to russia | They only go north for the summer. They head back south in the winter. | I like to imagine there's a few Inuit in Tuktoyaktuk that are completely surrounded by Texan tumbleweeds. | He thought that tumbleweeds migrate? | They migrate... Like your geese. | The great migration | What happens when they get to the north pole? What's Santa gonna do with all those tumbleweed? Put them in stockings? | Ohhhhh damn I thought I was an idiot because tumbleweeds definitely disperse their seeds by rolling around, but they spread over years and years. They don't just fire off from the American south into Canada in a single year lol | On their way to Fort Worth, of course | It was migratory tumbleweeds that allowed the Lois and Clark Expedition to first observe the Coriolis Effect. | You can even see one in the background of the moon footage. Those things go *everywhere* | But if spotted before the pole then they do stop, go back 1000 kilometers, and start again. | Seasonal migration | I love your reaction, but I would've liked it even more if you had started arguing with them, in this thread of all places. | I've been to Texas.

Still a good story, though.¬† | Going feral üíÄ | So, he really just made shitty creme anglaise? | I‚Äôve never used the powder (I was a chef so I know how to make it), but‚Ä¶ why on earth does it call for milk?? There‚Äôs not even milk in hollandaise? There‚Äôs not even milk solids in it after you clarify the butter. wtf is hollandaise powder smoking?? | Neat trick. Your sauce can't break if your base is loaded with emulsifiers! | Hollandaise with Milk?Bah | Not a chef, but I honestly didn't know you could make hollandaise sauce without the powder. | I'm at a loss as well.

While it does include the expected eggs and a few things that suggest the usual flavor such as citric acid, it also has a bunch of starch in it.  (I thought that weird enough that I looked at the ingredients of a few types of powdered egg and none o them included a bunch of starch so I'm guessing those are there to help foolproof the recipe).  But that particular powdered hollandaise requires butter and water.  Assuming whatever this eater was using was similar, I guess butter + water is somewhat similar to *milk*.

Meanwhile my best guess for why this powder is the way it is is partly dummy proofing it - the real stuff is simple in a way that's super easy to screw up after all - and partly because the real thing is almost entirely just eggs and butter with a bit of other stuff for flavor.  Delicious and also about as calorie dense a food as exists.  So maybe partly to make it easier and partly so the ""as prepared"" calorie count seems less apocalyptic. | [it‚Äôs not as gross as I expected](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/s/pmx5vyRHZh) but still not fantastic‚Ä¶ | In his defense, the guy had hepatitis-C, and was suffering bouts of confusion and memory and cognitive issues. | Who‚Äôs the one that thought if the woman swallows a camera it could take a look at the baby? | As someone entering Climate Change research to *hopefully, but unlikely* avoid politicians and beaurocracy, I agree.

And I lived in California that doesn't really follow the British seasons but we still call them the same thing. So why shouldn't they call dec-feb winter and it's just hot weather? It was a British colony. So I didn't know if the season names followed the weather or the calender. Obviously it has never mattered to me that much. I did Google it today. | I need a  nap. | Ah. As an American, I have been traumatized by consistently hearing things of this level come from Republicans and so it's easy to make assumptions. | But you can't vacuum up a brick.

I was working under the assumption that the measurement comes from a gravity based scale.  

Yes mass-wise 1kg of either is identical, but all *measurements* coming from gravity scales have an error due to the difference in forces.

Meanwhile they keep the rooster around because they think it's necessary for the eggs when they should have eaten it on day one. | Tbf it's mostly cause of the breeding that they do this. It's not like good for them to lay every other day. | Your teacher is what we like to call ‚Äúwrong‚Äù.

Now, you can eat fertilized chicken eggs. Embryos only develop if they‚Äôre incubated, so it‚Äôs really no different than an unfertilized one. | No, but it's still sex!

We had to get parental permission, and some parents did not give the school permission. By the way, that's stupid. We had one guy who had to sit out the class. We just filled him in on what we learned later. üôÑ I also remember we had separate classes for the boys and girls, and a few unisex lessons. | Even with sex ex being barely talked about, it should be common sense that periods and sex have no correlation with each other. | True, but if it‚Äôs not being taught in schools, I feel like the parents need to be the ones teaching kids what they need to know. Which, honestly, they should be doing anyway. | We got a single day of sex at in high school. That was enough to get the basic anatomy of the male and female reproductive systems along with some basic physiology. It's moronic that people don't know this.  The last person I spoke to that didn't know basic female anatomy got offended that I asked if he grew up in a cult. Wtf else am I supposed to think? | Oh yes, it was the baby picture during the sti/std picture showing that made bodies hit the floor. I remember to this day, the classmates who had to be dragged out legs dragging to the nurse's office. 

Public school's closest thing to sexual education is the pamphlets on the wall about how to deal with teen pregnancy. Spoiler alert, it doesn't help at all. Then again, if you were picking up those pamphlets, you were already cooked. | >I think that's more to blame on sex ed, or the lack thereof, in schools. health programs are largely underfunded and some schools flat out don't teach sex ed anymore

Luckily my School had Sex Ed (in what for Americans would be the Equivilant of Middle school.)  We had it Multiple Times and In Depth. Like we learned Every Step of how Reproduction works how Menstruation Cycles work, how to Prevent Unwantef Pregnancies, how to Abort,Stds And the Full anatomy of all Sexual Organs (Genitals of Both Genders, Uterus, etc.) It was annoying and Slightly uncomfortable at times but I'm honestly Gratefull to that. The Biology Focus my School had was Increafibly Good. Not just for good Sex Ed but also because we Spend an Entire Grade talking about Various Drugs, their Effects, how Addictions work and why Drugs are Fucking Awful. So I'm gratefull for all that.

So I genuenly don't understand why other Schools don't teach shit like that. It's increadibly Important to know! | So it's his fault the school system failed him? Maybe calm down | [removed] | Jesus. Next they'll try and tell you that women can have orgasms. As if! | Totally doesn't exist | Name checks out. | Same thing with the female orgasm. It‚Äôs just a little show she does to show she likes you. | I've never been in an intimate relationship with a woman where that move wouldn't have resulted in me getting stabbed in the head. Props to you sir. | >And sex ed for me was 100% about men. Women were not mentioned

That was the failure point. Sex ed should be about both sexes. You shouldn't assume a child has siblings. | I remember having such a class in maybe grade 6, and at the end of it all the girls were taken to a different class for a private conversation. I asked a girl about it afterwards and she looked really uneasy about the whole situation but wouldn't tell me. Years later I realised that they'd had the talk about periods/menstruation with the girls. It made sense since it would start happening to them within the next 1-4 years, but the boys were kept in the dark about the whole thing - I assume so they wouldn't make jokes about it at the time. | I grew up with two older sisters. Menstruation was never explained to me. I worked around mostly guys in my youth and they didn‚Äôt know anything. It wasn‚Äôt until I met my wife that things were really explained to me. I was 24 | I have absolutely educated my preteen son about periods. It's information he should know, and it should be normalized as much as possible. | i have 3 sisters and reddit and wikipedia taught me everything i know | Yup same! | And americans on this page wonder why europeans feel superior... | I think there are also many women that don't really know what's going on either! | Fun fact, people with uteruses have a much higher tolerance for internal pain, because menstruation is simply *that painful*. | Reminds me of this SNL skit üòÇ

The word benign I have issues with, since if one isn't humble enough then it is no longer a benign flaw.  

Only taking it apart because it is the best statement I have read in quite some time. | Blame it on those religious nuts who don't want the school to teach anything except the parts of the Bible that they choose.  Hypocrites. | Every fucking time | There was for me in the 70's as well. I am talking more current however. I live in DeSatan's state where it's to the point that even saying the words boy or girl is enough to get a teacher sued. | Not everywhere. Florida does not. At least not anymore. Or when my children went to high school, my youngest recent graduated and the oldest is 27. None of them were taught in Florida schools. | Pennsylvania school in the early 80‚Äôs.

And no, breaded patties of chicken nugget paste don't count.  Those are trying to be fried breasts, like in a chicken *sandwich*.  If you ground up beef and breaded and fried it and put it on a bun you'd have a country/chicken-fried steak sandwich, not a beef burger.

The conversation did encourage me to look up the freemasons though. I've read some have such a strong belief system that the Christian church used to deny their members. I've also read that they believe in some sort of grand architect. Why does a group of stone Masons need to have a theological system? I feel like there's more than what's discussed. | He actually said that there's a group of Masons called 33rd degree Masons that ""work for the other side"".. I'm guessing that's who you are referring to. He said they were the ones who spread the lies about us getting to the moon. He also said Kubrick did the moon landing footage. 

Also about the accelerators, he said that it's ""fallen angel technology and that it has damaged our world"".. and the demon worshipping at the accelerators happens during the equinoxes. 

The wild part is that he's been a friend since childhood. We used to smoke weed and skateboard around the neighborhood in Jr. High. Then he moved to Austin, TX and got hit by a car and almost died. That's when he found God. From there he went into his freemason shenanigans. If he wasn't already a friend there's no way we'd be friends today. He basically thinks I'm a sheep because I'm an atheist and hold stake in science and technology. | I didn't intend to offend anyone. I only know what I've spent 5 minutes reading about the Masons on the internet. I was just flabbergasted by the conversation. Like any hole I'd poke in his argument he'd respond with ""demons did it to trick people"". How. How am I supposed to even argue against that. | Worse!

(I was adding 1+2 like you do with the rule for 3's, not thinking of 12/4=3)


eg  123,354 is divisible by 3 because 1+2+3+3+5+4 is 18 which is divisible by 3 | Holy shit, that is so cool. How did I get through 497 college math courses and never learn this? Must‚Äôve been absent that day. | TL;DR and focused on the important bits:

* Divide by 2? Everyone knows this - it has to be an even number.
* Divide by 3? Many people know this: add up all the digits of the number until you have a number that's less than 10 and if that number is divisible by 3 then you can divide by 3.
* Divide by 4? If last 2 digits is divisible by 4 or ends in 00.
* Divide by 5? Ends in 0 or 5.
* Divide by 6? Must be an even number that can also be divisible by 3.
* Divide by 7? Fuck you.
* Divide by 8? Same as divisible by 4 except it has to be last 3 digits.
* Divide by 9? Similar to rule about the number 3 but the resulting number must be 9.
* Divide by 10? Everyone knows this - must end in 0. | Nice. | ‚àö69 = 8 something | I was going to upvote but you're sitting at 69.

It's scary knowing 2nd grade me was smarter than some teachers. | It really speaks to how bad it is in some schools when a student is trying to explain to a teacher how basic multiplication and division work. | Oh, I know.

The teacher was very much a substitute and not really qualified to teach us. And math was very much not their subject.

It just always stuck with me that they wouldn‚Äôt just try some simple examples to see with their own eyes that it works. | In mathematical terms it‚Äôs because multiplication is commutative.

A times B times C is the same as A times C times B.

Or, you can just put some simple number in:

3x4 is 12. Half this to get 6.

Or, half the four first, so you get 2x3 which is also 6. | Here in the U.K., the lowest rung is PE/Games teachers.

Christ this is day one shit. I hope you don't have that same attitude towards charting. | Even cooler, you're taking a digital roots (or running modulo 9) on it. 143067 = 1+4+3+0+6+7= 21, 2+1=3, so the number is divisible by three, but NOT by 9. | You know how we did remainders when you first learned long division? If it's divisible by 9, it has to be divisible by 3. Modulo is just ""divide and tell me the remainder"", so if the remainder is 3 you have a multiple of 3 | Another edit, I'm not convinced I fully understand the rule.

131 and 535 also satisfies this description of the last two digits adding up to 4 (or 8) and not being divisble by 4.

Tardigrades are animals. 

It‚Äôs not semantics, you‚Äôre adding an operative definition to the word animal that doesn‚Äôt exist. Kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species. 

If it is in the kingdom animalia, it is an animal. Words evolve, but the word animal does have a specific technical definition and boundaries you are simply misinformed about. | From a scientific standpoint absolutely.

From a colloquial standpoint, I think there's wiggle room. It's be weird if someone called an insect and animal in everyday conversation. 

For example, if someone said they kept getting animal bites in their sleep, I'd be incredibly alarmed.

If they said bug bites, probably less so.

Or if you were stung by a bee, you wouldn't claim to have been ""attacked by a wild animal"".

In science, no distinction. In the English language, there's nuance. | I'm not saying it's rooted in reason, it's just an intuitive thing.

I think much less about killing 1,000 termites with a bug bomb than I do about killing one mouse with a mouse trap, which I think *much* less about than putting down a dog.

The more ""human"" they look (distinguishable features like eyes, mouth, and nose, for example) the more relatable their life is to mine. Good example is a turtle versus frog. Definitely feel much more sympathy toward turtles than frogs, they have clearly distinguishable faces, neck, limbs. Also have observable personality.

A lot of Protestants regard veneration and worship as the same thing, and therefore claim Catholics are evil pagans worshipping false gods alongside the real one. | Yes, it‚Äôs a worry.

But sometimes the degree of Mariolatry amongst *some*, not all, Roman Catholics suggests that, for them, the Christian aspect is only a thin veneer on an older worship of a mother-goddess.

I was raised as an [Anglo-Catholic which is different from being a Roman Catholic.](https://anglicancompass.com/what-is-anglo-catholicism/) | Interesting, how so? | Thank you. Discordians always be feeling snub after snub. | Glad to hear that, I remember being a lil shook.

So that deduction takes years. | It is actually possible to be religious and also believe things that are true.

I know a lot of religious folks go about demonstrating the opposite, but there are rare educated Christians out there. | It's not mutually exclusive depending on how you interpret it. And those that say that the Bible isn't up for interpretation are forgetting the fact that was written thousands of years ago in a language that we don't speak.

My wife was a molecular scientist and former university professor (immunology) and we're Christian. She's currently a physician. She estimates that about half of her scientist friends are religious. | Many Christians belive in evolution. I would love to say most, but I don't actually know if that is true, but it's certainly a good chunk.

The catholic church for example completely accept scientific evidence of the age of the earth.
Is a bit less specific when it comes to evolution. The current pope accepts evolution ( and the big bang theory), but the instruction to catholics essentially says ""belive whatever you want"".

Really, as long as you are willing to accept that not every word of the Bible is literally true, and that it includes metaphorical elements as well, you can easily accept both evolution and Christianity.

If you dig a bit deeper into theology, you run into a bit of an issue, which is, if Genesis is not real - then why did jesus have to take our sin away?

The Catholic answer is the somewhat unsatisfactory ""while Genesis may be metaphorical, Adam and Eve were still real people"", without really backing that up in any way.

For your average Christian this doesn't really matter though. Most don't question their religion to that level.

I'm an atheist, and see lots of logical holes and contradictions in the bible, but this is not really a big one. | Evolution and being Christian do not inherently conflict. Evolution obviously happens, we can observe it in real time. But that doesn't mean all of it from the outset was just totally random. God gave a guiding hand to the evolution of early life is the belief you'll get out of most. | To me that's someone who truly believes and not someone following the rules because they were told to. | My take has always been if God is omniscient and omnipotent he's just built the perfect Rube Goldberg machine that is existence.  He layed it all out in a sorta intergalactic intamolecular domino pattern then just booped the first piece and everything has been chugging along since.  God the Creator doesn't have to mean he sat there hand molding everything, if he just made a system to end up exactly how it has that's still him creating the system.  No problem with evolution there at all. | My grandfather was that way.  He was a nuclear scientist but also a devout Methodist.  My father said that his father said that when the Bible said the world was created in seven days, it didn't LITERALLY mean seven days.  Gods days could be years in human time. In general, he didn't see the Bible as the literal translation of the word of God moe like a divinely inspired tale meant to guide ones morals and inspire kindness and charity.  So, for him, it was never a conflict because God could have created the world over millions of years, and evolution was just one of his works. | Was he Catholic? Even the Catholic church accepts evolution now from my understanding. 

A lot of people essentially understand the Bible isn't  1:1 with the books within it, the times are off, some stories are just stories, and you just are to derive morality from it. 

If you believe in biological determinism, (which you should) and god is omnipotent, you can make easy arguments whether peoples fates are determined before they are born, biologically and god also knows the future and what actions you will take because he is omnipotent, so he knows whether you'll be saved or not from the get go. 

These two arguments can go hand in hand surprisingly well. | Robert Bakker is perhaps the most famous dinosaur scientist on the planet, he is also a Pentecostal minister. | I had a friend who basically believed that fossils were simply part of the plan and that humans are curious, so God gave us something to be curious about. Maybe your Dad views it in that light? | That‚Äôs the hard thing, being a menu religious. I‚Äôll take a little of this and a little of that, but not any of that. It‚Äôs exhausting. No one who does that has any right whatsoever to tell anybody else how they should think. | LOL yeah, *they* are the conspiracy theorists... | I was a teenager when my aunt told that story (I'm a year older than my cousin). She told it in a ""here's a funny thing my kid said"" kind of way. Though I can always appreciate some skepticism within reason.

The scary part is the lack of accountability. | I think they mean if the twins looks absolutely identical, and one of them tricked you in believing they were the other one, that could be a justifiable mistake. | I think the issue lies in the fact that the word is more commonly used as a synonym for just overall something being sad. Like a movie can be depressing. Or the weather. Or news. And someone can feel depressed after watching a depressing movie. So unless you've been taught about depression the mental illness, it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that the true meaning of the term would elude a person.

She hated it. He didn't listen when I tried to say it, so I essentially had to write him a letter explaining it. I don't let him near my kids (or consider him a friend) any more, for this and other related reasons. | Oh and when you go in for job interviews do you decline to shake the interviewers hand? | But did you tell them that? Or just yell my body my rights at them? | Honestly, I think some of these people would want that.

That‚Äôs the point I was making you so deliberately looked past. Adult life is full of minor but necessary inconveniences required to make it through the day. Failure to teach your kids that is not setting them up for success. | I can agree with this. This is a sensible compromise. | Yeah and a grown adult can get over there grandkids not wanting a hug. Maybe they where having a bad day, maybe something happened they just don't want to be touched, maybe they don't like physical touch. But as a grown adult you should be able to get over a child not hugging you and if you don't then maybe you shouldn't be around children.

It's the child's body. I was forced to hug a cousin and he was Sexual assaulting me.

The sharp edges matter because it creates small gaps where the electricity can jump from one bit to another, making a spark. Go look up videos of metal things in microwaves, like forks, crumpled tin foil, and cd's, and enjoy the pretty lights. | A former roommate of mine tried to microwave oatmeal in a red solo cup once. She did not eat it once she saw how malformed the cup was after about 30 seconds. It just didn‚Äôt cross her mind that it would melt because our reusable bowl were also plastic | When microwaves first came out my sister snatched one for us but there was no instruction booklet. We had a very loose idea on what to do and learned the hard way not to microwave eggs.

I also learned about microwaving plastic. While my mom was passed out I wanted brownies but our oven didn't work. Smart kid that I was, I knew you couldn't put metal in a microwave so I found some cool tupperware plastic to put the brownie mix in, read the back of the box where it said to cook them for 45 minutes, then put them in the microwave and went to my room to wait. Wasn't too long before billows of smoke were filling the house. Took me forever to clean up the melted plastic and I never got the smell out of the microwave, but luckily mom never woke up and had no clue. | Yeah, I argued like fossil fuels and actual pictures of the entire bones within the earth, and she told me those things didn't align with Genesis.

As I said, I don't think he's in the right for what he did, I'm only trying to explain why he did it. Perhaps I'm too optimistic, but I do not think your dad did what he did because he doesn't care about you, it seems that he doesn't quite understand the gravity of the situation. | I wouldn't be so quick to bash her, she's from a rural area in my home country.

The only reason to make abortion harder to get is to punish women for being sluts.¬†


Now to be fair, some pro-lifers do push for easier adoption and lower costs for infant and child care. But they're a very clear minority. The main effort, by a long shot, is simple prohibition. When you stand next to pigs, you're going to get mud on you even if you yourself are not a pig. | I feel worse for animals who get tortured or killed for fun instead of a useful purpose than I do for unborn fetuses. | Ok, give me an example. | I love how this somehow needs explaining. Let's say I fall into a body of water alone. What do I do? Die? | That's true, but the same could be said about any skill. I think it's an important skill to learn too, but I wouldn't say everybody *has to* learn it.

If the difference is because it could potentially save you from death, then I'd argue very few people die from drowning in the first place (4k/yr in the US) and most of those people are babies, and I'd assume most of those adults are drowning because they're bad swimmers and not because they can't swim.

I mean personally all the (several) friends I've known that can't swim are extremely averse to deep waters, so I doubt they'd unintentionally end up drowning. 

And that's not even in a desert lol | woosh | Wow. Mean and dumb?! Like Pick a struggle girl lol I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs not doing well now too lol | It's probably because you don't consciously notice all the steps you take to get the answers it just seems intuitive to you which is hard to explain when you ""just know"". I can't learn everything, but the things I DO learn I can teach. That's because I pay attention to every tiny step I take to get an answer whether that's math or how to gill crab or how to run a crane or how to check a guest into a hotel. 

I'm sure theory is something you could master. Theory is just all the little parts in one big picture and you already know what the whole looks like. Knowing what the end result should be certainly helps!

Saudi Arabia, who severed diplomatic relations with Germany 10 days after invasion of germany, who let USA build airforce bases in it's country, whos entire economy was based around selling europe oil felt nothing?

Peru cooperated militarily with the US during the war, basically Peru garunteed to patrol certain parts of south american waters, sink any submarines found and pass on any inteligence gathered. They also made bank selling raw materials to USA war effort.

SE Asia, for example, was (broadly speaking) subject to Japanese aggression to a greater extent than German aggression. Their view is therefore going to be a lot more focused on their own occupation at the hands of the Japanese than it would be on the goings on in Germany and the European theatre. 

The fact that it was a *World* war doesn't mean ""the world has to know what happened to us"", but rather ""the world had it's own piece of history and involvement it remembers"" - and that doesn't necessarily include what the West deems relevant. 

Depending on the country, it may also be less pronounced as an event in their history - I've got extended family from Malaysia, and whilst there isn't ignorance of German atrocities, WWII was another invasion by a foreign power in a long list of foreign invasions. Hell, when they surrendered to the Japanese they did so as a British colony, due to the British invading in 1824 and occupying what had previously been a Dutch colony, who had invaded in 1641 what was previously a Portuguese colony, who had invaded in 1511, etc. | My mind is going a mile an hour | A tank tailgating you on the freeway doing 60 seems fast

Or riding a bicycle going 60, also fast

60 miles an hour on roller skates playing chicken with a tank going 60 mph and it suddenly feels like interdimensional travel which is funny because if you lose the game of chicken and hit the tank head on there is a slight possibility that you will be transported into a different dimension. | Car on the highway?

I was in that small minority and then I became single in my late twenties and guess how long it took me to catch it, two seconds. If it hadn't been him it wouldn't have been any of the next three boys I kissed. Hsv1  sheds asymptomatically like a motherfucker, like several times a month, and most people are asymptomatic so there was no such thing as me dating even half casually without it happening eventually.

The body can deal with most strains of HPV on its own, but some can become cancerous. Herpes won't develop into anything as serious as cancer, but can make a person more susceptible to chicken pox or shingles later on. 

And 'genital herpes' isn't a thing, either. When  people talk about 'genital herpes', they are usually referring to HSV-2, but it doesn't discriminate between infecting the mouth and genitals. | yeah that's what I mean. interesting | Maybe they meant a huge percentage globally has it? Cold sores are oral herpes, and STI panels do not test for any kind of herpes unless you specifically ask for it. Plus many people are asymptomatic and never have a single sore, or they may only have one or two in their lifetime | Based on another comment they made, I think they were including chicken pox and shingles as herpes, which are all in the Herpesviridae family. | People have said that to me too.

I saw a moose in the yard one day, now we have rats in the barn. Coincidence? I think not. | Now, that's just a damn shame. | No, a moose would shed 1,500 lbs to become a rat.

Caribou is the North American term for the wild animal of the same species.  Sorry, but I'm going to take [the word of the US National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/reinderrvscaribou.htm) over a random redditer. 

>Caribou and reindeer are the same species and share the same scientific name, *Rangifer tarandus*. Caribou are what the species is called in North America and reindeer are what they are called in Eurasia. All caribou are wild animals, whereas reindeer can be wild, semi-domesticated, or domesticated (animals selectively bred with a specific purpose in mind). | 120 mph in a minivan?

So many drivers just don't understand what it means and treat it like any other junction, pulling out if it ""seems"" clear.

It's easier for the restaurant to slap two of them on there than to start making actual half-pound patties.

We take McDonald's for granted but they are a marvelous well-greased machine of precision for mass-manufacturing unhealthy but edible food at rock bottom cost. Everything is optimized to an extreme only possible through decades of corporate experience.

Not that they pass any of that efficiency down to you in the price, though. Do you want fries with that? :) | The burger is not the patty, it's the sandwich. | You know what they call a big Mac in France? | Could have been even better if you worked there.

See, they put a special ""angus seasoning"" on those that was actually really good, but they wanted too little on them in my opinion. So when I made one for myself I would stop the cook cycle halfway, poke holes in the patty and pack them with the seasoning, and then return them to the cook cycle.

Also you didn't spell it out clearly which is why I am asking if he insisted they were celebrating American Independence day on July 1st or had just been using 4th of July as a stand in for the phrase ""Independence day"" and you misunderstood. | You could be forgiven for thinking it's actually the Queen's birthday on one of those public holidays. That's fair. Hell even I will choose to celebrate my birthday on a different day if the date doesn't suit me.

‚ÄúVaccines cause autism. Trust me, I‚Äôm a doctor and academic actively publishing on the topic!‚Äù Would have been a fallacious appeal to authority even in ‚Äò98 before the paper was retracted.

A properly qualified person should be able to cite the appropriate research. As already mentioned both of your examples are appeal to authority.

A researcher would have the advantage of being able to cite their own research, but the research and measurements are the argument, not their title.

But to say that dictionaries are propaganda is stupid.

In our particular argument they claimed the definitions of homophobia and zionism are not the correct ones because their circles on twitter use those words differently. | Probably linguistics | You mean Librul Indoctrination camp!? | They said that Homophobia is fear of gay people and they are not afraid of any gay people which I pointed out that its not just fear of gay people, its fear of homosexuality, aversion to homosexuals etc.

They said Zionism is about never ending expansion and killing of anyone who is not a jew, and I pointed out that Zionism has nothing to do with that and showed the definition in all major dictionaries which clearly states its just the support of the existance of Israel as a homeland for the jews. | > zionism

Is the line in venture bros actually a carrie reference? | I don't even want to approach that topic. Maybe that was punishment for giving birth? No because she believed a woman's job was to have children. I have no idea. There's enough crazy in the world without trying to dive in that! | Oh wow ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è don't I feel like an idiot now?

Well this goes down in one of my dumb moments list ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ | Yeah I didn't want to be around her at all. I was in a situation at the time where I had to tolerate her for about a year. That's a different story. 

I'm over the first person I told about her was my own mom who gave me this lecture about how I was being judgmental and how I was lying and blah blah blah and I shouldn't spread rumors blah blah blah blah blah blah blah 

Then to try to prove me right, my mother came for a visit with me the next time I had to go to her place. Be weren't there for more than 15 minutes before my mom lost her shit instead of screaming and then grabbed me and we left. And yes I was in my early twenties at the time I was not a little child. 

My own mother is not a saint she was an abusive alcoholic. So for her to actually hate somebody else like that really said something. She couldn't believe I was telling the truth which is the moment that I realized just how insane this woman really was | Hey if it makes you happy üòÅ | Frusen-Gl√§dj√© | >I am wickedly curious about the taste!

Buy some eggnog ice cream. Add lemon and cayenne to taste. Should get you close ish | I did not. Tried to use it as a ‚Äúteachable moment‚Äù after he came back and cooled off. Honestly that place was a bunch of line cooks being supervised by FOH managers. The ‚Äúsous chef‚Äù made me a ‚Äúlobster quesadilla‚Äù by straining the chunks out of the frozen lobster bisque, and then serving it with the strained soup as a ‚Äúdipping sauce‚Äù. They had no idea what they were doing.  9 months with high turnover and no executive chef, that place was in ruins. | Actually saw him in Cleveland a few months ago for his ‚ÄúOne Dead Man Show‚Äù at the agora. Was a good time. | There‚Äôs a packet version I use when I‚Äôm making eggs Benedict at home cause I live alone and amnt bothered to make hollandaise just for myself. Calls for me to add milk to the packet mixture and heat gently. Its a decent approximation of hollandaise | Here I am wondering what fucking powder people are putting in hollandaise | It's just egg yolks, melted butter, lemon juice, salt, white and cayenne pepper. 

Here's Jacque Pepin's recipe for Hollandaise where you can use a blender (it just makes it easier). 
You mix the egg yolks and lemon juice together first and then add in the melted butter.

Dude's been making it as a moron for a long time and it's really inspiring. | A republican, most likely.

EDIT : Just checked. Yup. Vito Barbieri. Republican. | Lmfao, I can only imagine them actually trying this, and they get to her bladder and are freaking out because they haven't seen the baby yet. | idk about anyone else but nancy reagan had a personal astrologer and she took that astrologer dead seriously | He was a Democrat?

Actually, I've met guys, yeah, maybe. | Starting about 20 years or so ago, i saw that occasionally (like, once every few years), usually someone going for the ""Well, actually..."" superiority angle.

But recently I've been seeing it _constantly_. Not sure what's going on with it. | My chicken raising buddy takes great pleasure in this. I still love eggs, lol. | I think that they should teach kids, in second or third grade, that roosters are only needed if you want *baby chickens*, and that hens will keep laying without a rooster around. | Can you elaborate on this? Hens with adequate calcium and nutrition do just fine laying daily, for years. | .... Wow you really went and proved everyone's point here. People know nothing about chickens. üòÇ | I assume you‚Äôve never raised chickens. | lol - whether you like it or not a hen is going to lay and egg! If does depend on nutrition and lighting and a lot of other factors but they typically lay about an egg a day in their prime! | There‚Äôs also balut, which is a steamed duck or chicken egg that was a few days away from hatching. | Yeah it makes sense now. I don't think I heard the period analogy until...Reddit? Honestly I think my 1980s Texas public education was too squeamish. That or I was absent that day. I also didn't know about the cloaca, so | Where is Mac? | I‚Äôm buying you a bird. | OH MY GOD! I had an opossum named Frank too! My ex-landlord was this old guy who loved crabbing, but would sometimes leave his crab traps in the backyard without cleaning them out till the next day. 

He left without cleaning them one time. The smell of the bait must have attracted the poor dude because he climbed in through the side and it sprung shut on him. Idk how long he was in there, but after I finally dumped him out, (and ran away squealing because I thought he'd chase me,) he barely moved. 

I left him plenty of water, fed him a hotdog, and left a couple of cans of cat food around him. When I checked on him a few hours later he was gone, but that big bastard would hang around the neighborhood after that. Good old Frank the tank. Beast of an Opossum. | ‚ÄùEvening, Frank!‚Äù

‚ÄùHey, Charlie how you doing? Where's Dennis?

‚ÄùPoopin.‚Äù

‚ÄùClassic Dennis...‚Äù | So, that makes you Mac right? | What‚Äôs the connection? | I‚Ä¶.I love this | If you don't have a pet ostrich named Dee I'm going to be very upset. | Heh, all your pets have human names. | awww, i have a doggy called Dennis, too!!! :) | The connection between your weird pets and lack of girlfriend?  I think we get it. | I had an apartment that had a wooded area next to it. I was on the corner so I would see all sorts of wildlife.

We named the possum Todd. It became a game where we just named all the critters. Hey, Rupert is out here! (a raccoon) The groundhogs were Phil. There were so many cats but we named all of them too. My son was younger and he got a big kick out of it. | Love that. Whats the reason for the name Tony | til! thank you friend | Alright, that's the least alarming option accounted for... | damn this dude has no game | I hope you take pics of him | Like going over to your stoner neighbor's place for a beer | I had a coworker who believed that black people are the real Native Americans. I was too terrified to ask him if the trans-Atlantic slave trade was real or if it went the other direction or what. He was definitely some kind of hotep. Anyway, he ended up shitting himself at work and quit rather than come back and face us all. | ah I had the thread open forever so I probably missed some other replies posted after I clicked on it yeah. should've reloaded to see if it was already answered | ü§£ no she was black | The center of the earth is the core. The center of a sphere is never on the surface. | I remember the 5th grade menstruation talk with the school nurse( circa 1977). She pulled out a bunch of huge maxi pads and explained when you
"" became a young lady."" 
You had to wear one of these like a diaper for 7 days.  She stated after that you could not sit on your Dad's lap anymore. 

 She handed each girl a pamphlet and a small bag supplied by the kotex company with a pad that was 3 inches thick and about a foot long,with safety pins to hook it to your underwear. 

There was no mention at anytime there would be blood. 

Lots of girls thought they were dying for years in my town.

Edit omitted word | Same except they separated the boys and girls to talk about their own gender and then showed a video on how if a boy gets an erection from seeing his crush, it's totally normal, and we shouldn't make fun of him for it. | My sex ed class had a relay race for putting condoms on bananas | ""I am required by state law to show you these pornographic, yet clinically accurate , pictures of anatomy. 

You are now informed, and may Jesus have mercy on my soul. 

Now, do not touch yourselves, or each other, before marriage. In pure thoughts send you straight to hell | Yea.  I think identifying organs is worth some instructional time, but there's a lot more to go past that. 

And God forbid we ever teach consent... | A lot of people are shockingly incurious about things. If I come across a question or idea, I'll look up information about it. But that never even crosses the minds of some. | Keep in mind that someone has to both think to want to look it up, and want to look it up.

I live in the USA and I might say ""Wait, is Kentucky land locked or along the coast?"" And I'd look it up and get my answer and be done with it. I have the ability to study a map of the placement of every state and commit it to memory... but because I can look up the info whenever I want, there's less reason to commit it to memory if I want to be lazy or dumb.

It's even worse when people just assume they know something. Why would they look it up if they're already sure about it? I was just watching an episode of Last Week Tonight where John Oliver used a photo of Venus to talk about UFO sightings, saying ""Everyone knows what Venus looks like, after all, except you don't, because this is actually a photo of Titan."" People readily believe whatever the hell they want.

I think people have gotten worse about learning due to having 24/7 internet access. Why learn when the answer can just be given to you? Instant gratification is a hell of a drug. | Lions mane took on a whole new meeting after that fateful day in 8th grade. | I was in highschool about ten years ago in the US. Our biology teacher lamented that she couldn't show us genital warts and other STDs since they run rampant in our county, but warned us that we can contract them via sex. 

I agree that highschoolers really should be forced to see STDs in order to warn them about having random hookups. Just telling hormonal highschoolers ""No sex!"" really doesn't work. | Sex Ed is wildly different depending on location and year

When I went through in the 90s, I remember the teacher cracking jokes about how male genitalia 'just hangs out'

And eventually putting on a video where a guy was railing a woman from behind in the shower while he pointed stuff out... His daughter was in the class.. | I never saw any pictures of penis warts in sex ed, not saying that you didn't or disparaging your experience, for me it was a best friend of mine explaining what he went through when he got gonorrhea and "" thought it would just go away on its own"". That was all it took to convince me to have condoms always readily available and use them.

I also discovered, the hard way, that you can't carry them around in your wallet for 6 months and then use them and expect them to hold up. I literally had to go in and pick out the pieces. We did have a good laugh about it though. Thank God it was my serious girlfriend and not some random hookup. | Sorry, by the time they get to sex ed their defining school age trauma has already been claimed by shooting. | My public school sent us all to a church ""field trip"" where we had to watch slides of various states of diseased genitalia, and then they asked us to sign abstinence pledges. | I'm from Texas. We saw super close up gory images of nothing identifiable. It was possible to graduate k-12 having participated in sex ed and not have any general idea what a penis or vulva looked like. We had to label the internal view of anatomical features, like the testes and vans deferens, or the ovaries and fallopian tubes. 

We were also taught that abstinence is the only 100% way to prevent pregnancy and STDs. I never saw a condom. I was aware that birth control existed, but I don't remember whether or not we talked about it in class. | Half of my sex ed school program was learning about STDs. The other half was watching in high school a VHS of sex ed for primary schoolers. | Ha! Embarrassed teacher is right! Ours was done by our female p.e. teacher (I think the boys were taught by the male p.e. teacher, I dunno) and I STILL chuckle when I think about how red in the face that poor woman was when she had to say ""penis"".


I'm 40. I think I was 10 or 12 when we had sex ed. 30 years of her embarrassment causing me to tee hee. | Your comment just taught me the difference between the urethra and vagina and I'm f*cking horrified I didn't distinguish between the two. My entire life I did not realize those were separate. My God, this is unnerving. Thank you. Kind of. | Maybe the people that raised him, idk but that seems like a massive contributing factor | I think you‚Äôre getting fungi and humans mixed up. Certain fungi have dozens of sexes, humans only have a few. | there's only like 6 sexes that we're aware of, but most schools only teach the main two (XX), (XY) | Your mom certainly can. | I was the only one home when my little sister got her mensies. What a phone call and car ride that followed lol. I was 16 and knew nothing! | Older or younger sisters? I have 3 older. One of them got pregnant at 16 so I grew up with what to expect when you‚Äôre expecting, Cosmo, The Vagina Monologues and all kinds of other women centric literature as bathroom reading material and could practically be a gynecologist at this point. | Oh well to know the specific pathophysiology, it‚Äôs very very difficult based off clinical symptoms alone! Hence why we need imaging, labs, symptoms and history (also why we say to not use webmd cuz symptoms alone isn‚Äôt reliable). BUT you know your own body best and if you think something is wrong, trust that gut feeling and make sure to advocate for yourself :) | >The word benign I have issues with, since if one isn't humble enough then it is no longer a benign flaw.  

The *if* clarifies when ignorance is benign.

>Only taking it apart because it is the best statement I have read in quite some time.

Thank you! | >Blame it on those religious nuts who don't want the school to teach anything except the parts of the Bible that they choose.  Hypocrites.

More than what's left out of the curriculum, it's about how a naive dogmatic religious curriculum are very likely to handicap critical thinking, logical reasoning, and other faculties indispensable to being self aware of your ignorance and seeking knowledge.

My high school didn't teach home economics. 

But woodworking and auto shop were top priorities. /s | The dinosaurs in charge killed civics and shop classes in the USA awhile ago. | FL Tampa area. | Yeah some of stuff in their belief system is whacked.  But from what I understand, most of that is just vestige from its long history.  Its members want to believe in ""some higher power"", and that's about it as far as the religious stuff goes. Some don't even have that.  Remember this org supposedly is traced back to the middle ages.  They've had some rather colored history. | Ah, a TBI. That explains it. | Kubrick *did* do the moon landing footage.

On location. | You would think so... but apparently not. | No need at all, there's no prerequisite. | What‚Äôs the scam? | I've been in the same boat. A good friend of mine is a fully qualified electrician but he's also gone full-conspiritard and believes in so many strange things. He tried to tell me that you could get free energy from magnets if they are arranged correctly in some kind of flywheel. He justified this by saying that brushless motors are more efficient than the standard kind and it was because they use magnets to increase their efficiency. Also that this free energy from magnets is not used because ""They"" want to conceal such things from us.

When I called out this bullshit, he said ""Nah, you are thinking about this all wrong. Think of those wheels where they attach half full bottles of water all the way around, the water gives the wheel a boost as it falls and the wheel turns for longer if you spin it."" 

I didn't know WTF he was on about so he shows me a video of a bicycle wheel on a stand with all these water bottles attached to it. It did spin for ages but there must have been a motor in the hub or something, to fool people like him.

I said ""Oh for fuck's sake! you don't know your physics, mate!""

He got really angry and said ""FUCK YOU! Do you know how many exams I had to take to get qualified? Plus, you're a plumber so what the fuck do you know about electricity and physics?""

More than you mate, more than you it seems. | Now I'm thinking about those dumb jackoff flashlights that were weirdly popular in the 90s-2000s. Just shake it and make the magnet move back and forth to generate electricity!! 

At least these days with LEDs they would sorta make sense but back then with incandescent bulbs?? wtf why did anyone ever buy them

If I'm ever in the sort of emergency where I need a flashlight that weak and that hard to run, I'd prefer just a box of matches. | And likewise 123,354 isn't divisible by 4 (because 54 isn't either), but 123,352 *is* because 52/4 = 13 | 6 also reminds me of the fun fact that all prime numbers greater than 3 are either 1 larger or smaller than a multiple of 6. Anything that's +/- 2 of a multiple of 6 is an even number and anything that's +/-3 of a multiple of six is divisible by 3. | I showed my work, just not in the way this specific instructor wanted. No need to be condescending here. The lead instructor sided with me and said everything I did was just fine.

The guy was eventually let go due to sexually harassing a student so I had the last laugh anyways. | I think you're mixing up different rules. 

For 3: add all the digits together. If the result is divisible by 3, so is the original number.

6852- 6+8+5+2=21. 21 is divisible by 3. 6852√∑3=1284.

For 4- look at the last 2 digits (don't add them). If the last 2 digits are divisible by 4, so is the original number.

131-  31 is not divisible by 4, so neither is 131.  1,386,563,764-  64 is divisible by 4, so the larger number is as well. Try it. | Hasn't always been the case.. | Brown is orange with context. My girlfriend hates it when I argue that ""brown doesn't exist."" | There is no such thing as black light. You cannot project shadow. Black areas on a projector are just areas that the projector is not lighting up. They are only as dark as the ambient light in the room. | > Is it not? 

Don't you think you would have seen a flashlight that projects black if that were the case? | My brother in Christ, how are you going to ""project black""? | But mushrooms are Fungi, they're a separate kingdom of life. More closely related to animals than plants, but still separate | You might be the next story on this post bro | Trying to define facts by colloquialisms is among the dumbest shit I've heard today and I'm reading this thread... | I like to call this phenomenon ""cognitive bigotry"".

I do not mean it as an insult. Our brains are simply wired to sympathise more with animals when we think they are cute and have features that remind us of ourselves, when in fact all life deserve the same sympathy. | Same I've got probably 100,000 ants under my belt. But, when I saw someone start stomping on baby mice, I'm scarred to this day. That dude's been through some shit. | Are the tadpoles invasive or something? My initial thought was that they grow up to be frogs which then eat insects, but I know that there are invasive frogs. | And strictly speaking, a true bug is a member of the insect order Hemiptera, which includes cicadas, aphids, stink bugs, bed bugs, and a lot of other minibeasts ‚Äî but not ants. | *brogurt | actually if you parse what he said, he included a qualifier of ""something like that"" in reference to how effectively alcohol is at disinfecting surfaces, particularly at killing viruses. Meaning he was explicitly and specifically not suggesting using actual alcohol internally, but something different that has the same effect. The implication being something that is safe to use internally. 

It's also worth noting that ethanol inhalation isn't the craziest idea as a possible treatment for treating covid.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8783302/

I doubt this is something he was specifically thinking of, but it is possible he heard some snippet of the idea in passing throughout all the meetings surrounding covid and what he said is just how his brain processed the idea. | Also a lot of things like praying to Mary, and having shrines to her is a big no-no in protestant Christianity as it resembles worshiping false idols. | I'm just quoting from memory, but one of the rules is ""Don't touch someone if they don't want to be touched."" and other such really wholesome stuff. 

The name is just there to scare away religious nutbags. | ""It's free money, bro"". There was an accelerated depreciation program for a while, but I'm not buying six G-Wagons for a failing business. | I was raised in a very progressive, educated Catholic community. Of course, we believed in dinosaurs and being nice to other races and Jesus loves us, this I know, yada yada. When I moved out of my little progressive bubble, I was absolutely floored that some Catholics believe that pieces of Saints should be venerated! And what is this about somehow earning literal ‚Äúforgiveness‚Äù points from God for doing this and doing that?? Let‚Äôs just say my ex-husband was raised in a very different Catholic Church. So I‚Äôm agreeing, there‚Äôs such a whole range of people who say they‚Äôre religious but mean completely different things. | Catholics have no problem with teaching evolutionary biology. When I was a biology TA in a part of the country known for lots of conservative evangelicalism, I always loved getting Catholic school grads in my lab. The public school grads were less prepared, and the evangelical Christian school grads weren‚Äôt prepared at all.

Now, how you can understand biology and still believe in transubstantiation, I dunno. I‚Äôm not an observant Catholic any more. | I assure you we aren't rare, we just know the stereotypes that come along with being Christian | Growing up, I didn't realize people were unironically religious. I just thought religion was how people thought the world worked before science was invented. I thought the pope was just around for style points or something. Kinda like how the british queen was just vibing and not actually ruling.

I had religion classes in school and kinda just treated it like a history class, like a primer on how western culture got to where it is now. Here's where they built the pyramids, and here's where jesus got nailed to the cross, and then 2000 years of people believing in religion before science was invented, and now we're here with cars and shit.

I was about 14 when I was sitting in religion class and it started to get a bit deeper that I was like... hold up. That teacher is speaking passionately about god in present tense. She's serious and actually believes in god? It goes beyond just tradition and funny stories?? Mind blown. Nobody ever sat me down and told me they were serious.

I remember being confused that immigrants got to opt out of religion classes. I was like, huh? Why is that relevant? 

So much clicked into place when I realized what was actually going on. And it was far too late for me to still believe in it at that point. Both of my parents are religious and I never realized because we never actually went to church. I thought people just liked the crosses and mary statues as decoration. | Rare? Bro, most Christians are educated. Stop thinking screenshot rage posts that you see on atheist subs of boomer Facebook American Christians are representative of all religious people.¬†


On the other hand, it's hard to find educated atheists. Most feign education but are severely illterate in terms of philosophy, physics and history. The amount of atheists who believe that Jesus didn't exist despite the historical evidence outside of The Bible is extraordinarily high.¬†


And that's not mentioning all the ones who think evolution refutes God when it doesn't.¬†


There's a reason internet atheists in particular are hated and it's because the vast majority are so clueless on religion. One quick look on the atheist subs and the majority of the posts are atheists making straw man concepts of God (""sky daddy"") and posting paranoid conspiracy theories about Christians (""Christofascist"") worldwide wanting to create a theocracy. Yet it's mainly atheists promoting the neo nazi white replacement conspiracy theory and making Islamophobic racist posts which puts them more in line with fascists. Many of the new atheist movement leaders have especially promoted all this garbage in recent years from Pat Condell and Richard Dawkins to Sam Harris.


You should probably stop listening to atheist memes from 2007. Honestly it just makes you seem ignorant to regurgitate this crap about religious people not being educated. | Many scientific discoveries can be attributed to religious people, including priests, who have worked to 'uncover God's Creation‚Äô.  It‚Äôs mainly when some think that these discoveries challenge their abilities to control the people that they denounce science. 

This has happened in Christianity and in Islam. 

Muslim scholars kept knowledge alive (for example, of the Greek Philosophers) in what some people call the Dark Ages, and [expanded the sum of human scientific and mathematical knowledge.](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/30/science/how-islam-won-and-lost-the-lead-in-science.html) However, that religion turned inwards a few hundred years ago and this contribution stagnated. | [deleted] | But how can you have both when the beliefs are mutually exclusive/contradictory? | And the bible was passed down orally for decades, before it was written down. | Yeah, but there's religious and then there's American evangelical. You can't really compare Christians to American evangelicals. | Scientist huh? Gonna need a +/- on that estimation then. | Most Christians I know believe dinosaurs existed and fossils are real.

I think the Arc museum (in KY IIRC) says that dinosaurs were on the Arc or some weirdo BS theory like that. | ü§£ü§£ü§£ | Makes me sad, too, that our anti-creationism posts were downvoted LOL | I read the whole thing. The whole sentence.

A theory is a well-substantiated explanation of an aspect of the natural world that can incorporate laws, hypotheses and facts.

No one is there making you shake their hand; you get to make that choice for yourself. If someone refuses to hire you because you declined their handshake, you probably don't want to work there anyway.

Imagine getting on the internet and losing your shit, 5 comments deep, about you or anyone else's right to FORCE a child to touch you?! Absolutely insane of you. Seriously, seek therapy. | What an embarrassing comment | Yes, of course I told them. | I was forced to hug a cousin when I didn't want to and the reason I didn't want was because he was Sexual assaulting me. Still after they knew they would push me to hug him because he's family. All because you have a title such as ""grandma, brother cousin or etc"" doesn't mean you just get to hug and get to kiss a child that you didn't give birth too. I will stand by this till I dieü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | You are clearly not a good one | Nope, but I am a parent who lets her children choose whether they want to give someone a hug or not. Again, children deserve bodily autonomy and any adult who gets butthurt over a child not wanting to hug them needs to get over themselves. | I've been responsible for conducting interviews and making hiring decisions for a few different companies... it's honestly a toss-up whether someone shakes my hand or not and it's never impacted my impression of a candidate either way.

I don't know if there's a generational difference or if you're from a different culture or what but your beliefs here are at best not the norm and at worst just straight up incorrect. | Teaching your kids it‚Äôs 1) okay to go against their boundaries, if it‚Äôs beneficial, or 2) that certain situational Norms and etiquettes out weigh their set boundaries; is not a way to advance children in life. 

Teaching kids the importance of their voice mattering, and to speak up when uncomfortable is not putting your kids in a position of failure. 


In adult life sure there are minor inconveniences. But those inconveniences do not include unwanted physical touch. 

Missing the bus? An inconvenience. 

Someone being overally chatty when you‚Äôre in a rush? An inconvenience. 

Having to take a phone call, even if you prefer email? An inconvenience 


Saying no to physical touch. Wether that be a hug, a handshake, a high-five etc.? That‚Äôs not an inconvenience that‚Äôs setting boundaries.

I fail to realize how someone not wanting their person touched equates, in any way shape or form, to an inconvenience. ( because mind you, this debate pertains specifically and only to physical touch, not just life‚Äôs general inconveniences) 


Your point still fails to stand. There is importance to teaching your child that sometimes, the worlds unfair, but nowhere in that equation exists ‚Äú life is unfair. So that means you have to subject yourself to an unwanted physical interaction. ‚Äú 

Also as I said, if me saying no to a handshake in a interview was cause enough for me to not get the job. I‚Äôm much better suited elsewhere. As clearly the HM doesn‚Äôt have a grasp or understanding of boundaries. | > Adult life is full of minor but necessary inconveniences required to make it through the day.

this is such a dumb argument | Even if it is your child... If your child doesn't want to hug you, getting mad about it is probably the worst reaction.

Like, there's almost definitely a reason if a kid won't hug their parent, and practically none of those reasons can be handled by forcing/guilting them into hugging. | That's horrible I'm sorry to hear that happened. I wasn't molested and I'm very grateful for that so I'm looking it as it's a given that wouldn't happen which I know is idealistic. But we're talking about two different things here. Kids don't always know what's best for them and they need to be taught manners and discipline. Abuse is another thing.¬† | Oh really? That does make it all the more shocking to be honest. If she were from the UK, like myself, i'd have slightly more understanding as the education on that subject is somewhat lacking, or at least it used to be when i was at school. | That's exactly what I'm talking about, too. I'll put it this way. You may have a zero balance on your credit card, and let's say you have an 810 credit score, but if you carried a small balance on the card (the recommendation is 5% or so), you'd have an 815 or 820 or something. It doesn't make sense at first until you think about it from the bank's perspective - someone who uses their credit is more attractive to them than someone who never uses their card and therefore never pays any interest. You use your card, and since you pay it off every time, the balance is always reported as $0 on your credit report. To a potential lender, you are slightly less favorable than someone with a small balance. For someone with an 800+, it's negligible, but for people with lower scores, that little bit makes a difference. | Nope. If two people got the same score above yours, your score is ranked third. #1 and #2 are both Score X, and #3 (you) is Score Y. | Ahh sounds awful lol | Unlikely to kill you though.

Even the CDC said it | Hand is the way | Take my upvote | Yeah that‚Äôs the conclusion I came at as well. Sometimes adults are not adults enough | Not really, if you view an unborn fetus as a human I don't see how someone couldn't view that as murder. It's perfectly logical, and I can admit that because I'm not blinded by my hatred of people with opposing views. | ‚ÄúThe only reason to make abortion harder to get is to punish women for being sluts.‚Äù I‚Äôm about as pro choice as you can be but this simply isn‚Äôt true. My mom has always been a feminist and thinks sex education and access to contraception are always the best option, but she legitimately believes that a fetus is a person. When she was 19 she had a kid that she put up for adoption and still believes she made the right decision. I have no doubt that for a lot of pro lifers misogyny is a factor in their belief whether they admit it to themselves or not, but insisting that it‚Äôs the only reason is reductive of the issue, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the best way to convince people to change their minds. While I personally believe it‚Äôs a woman‚Äôs rights issue my mom and most pro lifers will simply never see it that way and just repeating you hate women over and over again is pointless. The only time Ive ever known someone to change their mind on the issue is when someone told them that murder isn‚Äôt wrong because that person‚Äôs heart is beating, it‚Äôs because that person has feelings and relationships that a handful of cells in a uterus isn‚Äôt capable of having. | Church goers/religious are the most likely group to adopt. | Maybe you should look at how abortions are done. Some are literally done by pulling the limbs off the fetus while it is still living. Late-terms are done very infrequently, but they can be done by cutting the neck with a pair of scissors. 

I wish pro-choice people* would advocate for insisting that abortion procedures kill the fetus as painlessly as possible (say, with a lethal injection of an opioid) before it is removed. Because frankly, most people would call an abortion doctor a psychopath if he was performing those procedures on animals instead of unwanted fetuses. And then of course, you have folks like Kermit Gosnell, who was both an abortion doctor and a psychopath. 

*Obviously, pro-life people actually benefit from the procedures being as horrific as possible, because humane abortions might be more tolerable to voters. | I can currently give you 34 reasons. None of the presidents before trump had one of those reasons. | One thing that was sad is that she had a miscarriage. That‚Äôs not something I wish on anyone | üéØ. Have you considered psychology. You said it so well. My mind sees something and runs to the conclusion even of I need an explanation I will soon forget and it just makes sense.

Going 60 mph on a bicycle feels a bit more than ""fast."" In my experience, on a bicycle 20-30 MPH starts feeling fast. 60 starts feeling a bit fast on a low-end motorcycle. | Depending on your personal belief system, that might be the case. | as long as you average 120 miles per hour, I don't see the problem. | Maybe but google maps says it would take an hour and a half just to get to newark which is only 10 miles away and 2 hours and 7 min for 70miles which is just some general location they pinpoint for you.

Herpes panels are notoriously unreliable. If you're not actively having an outbreak, the results may show up as negative. If you don't have the virus, you can still have a false positive from a test. Because of this, it's incredibly difficult to diagnose a case of herpes if you don't have an active flare up. 

On that note, be it HSV-1 or HSV-2, when grouped together in statistical models, yes, most people do have some form of herpes. At one point, the metrics pointed to around one in four women and one in six men having some form of the virus, though those numbers have likely gone up since then. Part of the problem where it concerns genital herpes infections is that people who are infected don't always disclose it to their partners because of the stigma associated with it.

Edit, missed word | Unrelated to what you're talking about, but personally learning of the euphemism treadmill has had the opposite effect. I've stopped caring about supposed slurs precisely because it's a never-ending cycle that doesn't really change anything. People used to consider 'stupid' and 'lame' slurs which were phased out by the euphemism treadmill, yet nowadays nobody bats an eye at their usage anymore. To me it's just a waste of societal energy that doesn't solve anything and only tries to fix a perceived problem, not an actual problem.

Mind you, I'm only talking about medically related slurs such as the examples used above. Those are the ones primarily affected by the euphemism treadmill. It's just a tiring thing. Instead of understanding that people don't actually mean to disparage, or even think about, the people the medical term actually refers to, they'd rather label it problematic. Which then results in people finding different words to use to mean the same thing, which we ALL know refer to the slur that's been deemed 'problematic'.

Dictionaries on the other hand, as a snapshot of time, can be representative of how a word was used in the past but no longer are, in other words they can mean that to nobody.

Based on the words you chose though, the better explanation is that they're engaged in a political fight over meaning and trying to convince a wider society of that meaning. Often such fights can be a product of perception that it's used disingenuously by the wider society in a way that doesn't acknowledge implications. | I just want to validate my biases against specific majors dammit | [deleted] | They are wood right? | Do people ask how ‚Äúice road truckers‚Äù cross the ocean? | Planes exist | That show is so amazing and so haunting at the same time | Internalized misogyny.

the scam artist will be chatting a lot to distract the clerk




&#x200B;











the total is $10.34









scammer gives $20










clerk gives back $9.66 










the scammer then says, wait actually I have another $1, while leaving the $9.66 on the table







&#x200B;






this is where the scam happens




the scammer will ask to exchange the $9 in change + an extra dollar for a $10 bill












in an even exchange, the costumer would give $1, plus the $9 bills from the ""$9.66"" and get a $10 bill back






HOWEVER, while the clerk was distracted, the scammer swapped out the $9.66 on the table for less money




&#x200B;





then the scammer goes to return the $9 bills from the ""$9.66"" + the additional dollar in exchange for a $10 bill, and pockets the $10 from the clerk





When the clerk recounts the change, it will come up short, it will be like $8 + 1 *(instead of the correct $9 + $1)*








The scammer then says ""you're right"" and adds an extra dollar to the pile, along with two $20 bills from his wallet and asks for a $50 back




Sure the scammer is getting a $50 bill from the clerk, and giving back $20, $20, $9, and $1.... which is an even exchange, except for the fact that the scam artist pocketed $10 from the clerk three steps ago







&#x200B;



here's a [video of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UVE-xWKVAc) from the 80s *(this scam has been around for a while)*




&#x200B;


If I go step by step with only monetary values, it's really easy to see the scam


&#x200B;


this is the same steps as above, but boiled down to purely the money transactions


&#x200B;



$20 *(traded for)* => $10.34 of goods and $9.66 in change


*(even exchange)*




&#x200B;



$9.66 swapped out for $8 by scammer




$8 + $1 *(traded for)* => $10 




*(scammer is up $1)*

Orange doesn't exist but purple doesn't exist more. | Militaries *hate* this one weird trick | Look my man, I don't know plenty of things. Then there's all the other shit I don't think about. | It‚Äôs like a vacuum cleaner for light. And it works from across the room! /s | Why did I read that in Anthony Anderson's voice from the Scary Movie films? | TIL... | My point was that it is neither a plant nor an animal and the number of people that think there is only plants, animals and rocks is too damn high. | That's exactly what they are not doing and not trying to do.

The definition is clear, but people are rarely 100% accurate in their use of language, so you can either try to understand them and see, that they are not trying to ban ants from regnum animalia or you can discuss semantics and get out your dictionary. | Interesting, I had no idea that ""bug"" was an actual technical term. | That's gotta be one of the most foul comments I've ever read | That's a little vague.  I mean there are similar quotes in the Christian Bible, so what's the difference? | I think it‚Äôs more the vocal minority, which unfortunately gets amplified quite a lot by the need for engagement and discourse. | Dude. Go reread my post.

Yes. I am making that point.

What? ‚ÄúIt is actually possible to be religious and believe things that are true‚Äù

Was the absolute dripping sarcasm in that line not enough for you to catch the hint? I suggest you follow your own advice and stop assuming it‚Äôs all rage bait shitposting. | I remember being in Catholic School in the 80‚Äôs when Pope John Paul II stated that evolution, the Big Bang, etc. could all absolutely be real, because if God is all-knowing then he could obviously have set the whole thing in motion knowing everything would end up how it did. Pretty revolutionary stuff for some folks, but totally made sense to my 2nd grade ass. | Is it? Human religion is.

Thought experiment. 

God made the world in 6 days. God's days. Humans see the sun rise and set and go 'day'. For God the day has just moved, not ended. How long since the sun had a really high solar spot activity dropping its output? A billion years? Half a billion?

Humans interpret creation as a tall breaded man saying chicken and a bird fluttering from their lips. What if God thought ""Chicken,  I'll slam a huge chunk of rock into this place to kill off these dino things and make that featheted one over there evolve into a chicken.""?

I'm not saying this is right or wrong. I'm saying Humans have no real perception of what a diety really is | The general thought among this crowd is that if the beliefs appear mutually exclusive, you are not understanding one or both of them. | What is contradictory about it? | The idea that everything in the Bible is literally true is a particularly American Protestant idea. Other types of Christians have no problem with the Bible speaking in metaphor or simply being wrong on some points. | And then someone came along and cherry picked the stories to compile it as the bible. | Evangelicals get a bad rap but they run a spectrum just like all protestants. Go to an evangelical church in a more modern, educated city and the people there will be pretty normal and possibly even progressive. I'm not saying they are the majority but there's more than I think people realize. I also wouldn't be searching for them in some backwoods, southern, country town. | I‚Äôve never met a Catholic that doesn‚Äôt believe dinosaurs exist. Wonder why that is such a weird topic on other branches of Christianity | Reading comprehension eluded you in school apparently. I wasn‚Äôt arguing in any way that the theory of evolution is not true. If you‚Äôre looking to argue on Reddit go find someone else. | right bro im sure youre a scientist ü§° thats why youre cooming on reddit fucking clown | evolution is still a theory and you‚Äôre all just crying because you can‚Äôt prove it no matter how hard you try clown child üíÄ | clown boy | not trolling just spitting facts fking nsfw gooner acct lmfao | yes the apes magically came from fish in the ocean which magically appeared from some type of star explosion makes perfect sense gooner | this is what happens when you watch too much porno and fap too hard you start to get brain worms like u/carpinthediems | Lol, I'm in no way trying justifying it. I'm just looking for extreme examples. | Said the same thing! 


It‚Äôs such a brain dead argument. Idk how they, in all their confidence, posted that edit as if it made any sense. | Understandable. I‚Äôll just never forget the hurt that the other grandma showed when the grandkids hid from her instead of hugging her. They just have anxiety, and of course now they‚Äôre all over her when she visits. She‚Äôs not born and raised in the United States, so just didn‚Äôt get it. There was certainly nothing I could do about it, not my kids not my place to say anything. | Clearly. | Your username tells me that you‚Äôre a kid. You‚Äôve got decades to grow up. | You didn‚Äôt see my story then. A grandma who my grandkids hardly see visited and reached out to give the grandsons hugs . The older one has anxiety issues and he was only about six, so he hid. She started to get really angry, instead of letting him warm up, because of course she took it personally and was hurt. My point is, that the parents should‚Äôve come and said it was OK to give grandma a hug or talk to grandma and let everything calm down and then give hugs. My point is that it‚Äôs very painful for a grandparent to be rejected by a grandkid. Of course there are reasons, but have some sympathy for a grandparent, who hardly ever sees her grandkids, and just wants a little hug. That is not perverse, that is not perverted, that is not imposing, that‚Äôs just being a family. There was absolutely no fear of abuse involved. Should the kids give hugs to creepy neighbor Jim? No, that‚Äôs not the same. You‚Äôre not there yet, so I don‚Äôt expect you to understand whatsoever. You will, though. | Exactly | How is it another thing, kids that don't get boundaries set saying they cant say no if not want to be touched can lead to being an easy target for pedophiles. I was taught to always hug everyone, I thought it was fine what he was doing due to being told I should always let them hug and kiss me if there family. They saw me an easy target because I would never say no thinking it's rude. So no it isn't another thing, it's what could happen if you don't teach your children boundaries are okay to be set even if it's family. | We aren't talking about 2 different things. Look up how many children are sexually abused. If you tell a child they HAVE to touch a family member, even if they don't want to, just to be respectful, what does that teach them? Exactly that. When a family member tells them they have to touch them inappropriately, the child thinks it's rude to refuse. Rape culture is literally because of this one simple thing. Millions of children would know they have the right to say no if we just set the standard of bodily autonomy immediately. I teach my son that the only time I have to make decisions about his body are regarding hygiene and medical decisions. He's also taught to respect other's boundaries and consent, including what is inappropriate. There is 0 benefit to forcing children to touch a family member without consent. I literally don't care how grandma feels, she's old enough to regulate her emotions and realize it isnt a personal attack for a child not to want a hug. If she cannot handle that, she needs to grow the fuck up. My child is learning to be a human who can regulate his emotions and confidently make decisions about his own body. You're objectively wrong. I'm not telling my child adults can touch you without consent. That's an objectively stupid and dangerous thing to teach a child. | ??? hard to see the relevance of your comment here of women being flirtatious whores. | No, there are genes on the X chromosome that are necessary for life. You need at least one copy. Interestingly there is a mechanism by which one of the X chromosomes in XX cells gets largely turned off so as to not have over expression of some of these genes

This X inactivation causes the patterning of Tortoishell cats | Probably not, but if it did exist it'd probably be doom guy | Some genes on the X are necessary for life, so if you had fertilization with YY, it would not be viable. So whether the process stopped at fertilization, implantation, embryo, whatever, the woman probably either never got pregnant or never knew she got ""pregnant."" People with YY don't exist because they were never born. | Absolutely. My favorite is Lamarckian genetics. ""Ha ha, giraffe passing on its ""stretched neck"" gene, lol, that's so ridiculous, what idiots! Experiences in a single lifetime aren't passed on in your genes!"" Geneticists: ""Actually, um, if you look at methylation ..."" | Dude‚Ä¶.stop talking | Coochie privileges revoked | Athlete‚Äôs foot has entered the room | Nah, I checked her ID, she was a Florida resident | The CDC's site directly says masking helps to prevent the spread of viruses.

https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2014564118 | An argument about fetal pain would have nuances and valid opinions on the pro-life side. A few of them even do so. Belief that it's fully a person, morally equal to any born child or adult, before the brain develops that far, requires some form of mysticism, which for some reason they think it's OK to impose as law. I can't find it in myself to respect that. Belief is fine, but they don't get to treat their belief like it trumps everyone else's. | Again, ""good"" and ""bad"" are subjective. You can say any one of those reasons makes him ""bad"" but a Trump supporter can give you one reason that makes him ""good"" in their eyes.

I had the unfortunate pleasure of learning how to identify  a main line (to the city) sewage blockage, and how to clear it not too long ago. | Oh yes. Those people are trash. I don‚Äôt typically run into those people in person nor have I really ran into it yet on the internet. My mom‚Äôs father was Israeli and Jewish so I have it in me too. I‚Äôm just not religious at all and was raised catholic anyway. | ""...typically a heated or angry one"" means that while arguments are typically heated, heatedness isn't necessary. That's my point. Heated arguments are easy. Constructive and friendly arguments are more difficult, but they are the ones we should strive to have with people we disagree with. | I know such people well. I live with one of them. I at least managed to get him to realise that the moon is illuminated by the sun with a little demonstration. 

During the day when the sun and moon are both visible in the sky, you can hold up a small ball and see that the shadow on the ball perfectly matches the phase of the moon. This shows it's the sun lighting up the moon and the moon is not self illuminating.

I've not managed to convince him the world is not run by a satanic cult of elites that farms and eats babies though. That's a tougher nut to crack. | Poor guy. | I am desperate to see what their explanation of the lunar phases are for a self-illuminating moon. Maybe every time the moon goes below the horizon a great cosmic dragon takes a bite out of it, and then it gets sleepy because it's full and the moon grows it back! | Poor friend.

Ask them to test for herpes. HSV-2 doesn‚Äôt discriminate because it‚Äôs not limited to just genital blisters. You can have HSV-2 from unprotected sexual contact blister up around your face, and not see a single blister on your genitals. HSV-2 is what‚Äôs called ‚Äúgenital herpes‚Äù because it *can* affect the genitals, but it doesn‚Äôt always involve them. | what they mean is that hsv1 which is oral herpes (cold sores) can be caught genitally via oral sex. It doesn't really want to live in your spinal nerve though because it's home is in your face so symptoms are much more mild when you get hsv1 genitally and it's significantallllly less contagious. Like after the first two years your asymptomatic viral shedding if genital hsv1 is only 2 in 100 days and continues to decline across your life. If you have oral hsv1 for over three months you will have the antibodies to protect against hsv1 genitally, some people catch it at the same.time.

Hsv2 is the opposite, it's the genital strain because it wants to live in your spinal nerve not your face. Because it's all nice and at home there the virus is very active so you get more outbreaks and it's much more contagious to be spread from genital to genital. Catching hsv2 orally is the most rare, it does not wanna be on your face and is almost exclusively seen in immunocompromised people. Having hsv1 doesn't protect you from hsv2, they don't have the same antibodies. 1 in 5 women have genital herpes of either strain, 80% are asymptomatic. 80% of population has hsv1 in their bodies. | Yes, exactly - both hsv1 (cold sores) and hsv2 (genital herpes)  can show up in either place. It's more common for hsv2 to be transmitted to/from the genitals, but it's not exclusive. 

I believe a swab will tell you if you have herpes, but a blood test is required to determine which type (I might have that backwards, I can't remember for certain which is which.) . In many places doctors won't do the test to determine which type because it doesn't change the outcome. The treatment is the same for both, but many people don't need treatment at all. | Genital warts are caused by HPV, not HSV. | Sorry to be that person, but the virus that causes genital warts is HPV and is not a herpes virus. Herpes can be cold sores or sores similar to cold sores (ulcers) on the genitals. | Thank you so much.

Satanic bible expressly forbids the owning of human beings. Satanic bible = 1 Judeo-Christian values = 0 | > Satanic bible

there's also The Satanic Temple's 7 tenets which are imo just better than the 10 commandments 

I. 
One should strive to act with compassion and empathy toward all creatures in accordance with reason.

II.
The struggle for justice is an ongoing and necessary pursuit that should prevail over laws and institutions.

III.
One‚Äôs body is inviolable, subject to one‚Äôs own will alone.

IV.
The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one's own.

V.
Beliefs should conform to one's best scientific understanding of the world. One should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs.

VI.
People are fallible. If one makes a mistake, one should do one's best to rectify it and resolve any harm that might have been caused.

VII.
Every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought. The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word. | Please quote me the verse that says women have the right to say no to a man at any point? There's some quotes about the penalty for raping a virgin, which in some cases, the girl is forced to marry the rapist, and the penalty is for the father's property being destroyed. Not really so much about not raping women in that book. Women are barely more valuable than animals. Women were created AFTER animals in one version of the creation story in Genesis. | If god created the world in a week, including humans, how is there space for dinosaurs and human evolution on the time scale we know it to take place on? 

Do you believe the world could be repopulated from very few representatives of every species after a worldwide flood when we can demonstrate the consequences of a genetic bottleneck?

Do you believe that women experience painful childbirth due to the evolutionary development of bipedalism and thus a narrower pelvis, or because Adam and Eve ate a forbidden fruit?

I do not believe science and Abrahamic religion can be reconciled unless you cherrypick which parts of the holy book are literal and which are figurative, which is an obvious issue in itself already even if you only subscribe to your religious creation story. | It was a group of people called the council of Rome in 382. | I'm no expert but I think it started to gain traction in the early 1960s. You also had other shifts among evangelicals, as well. For example, protestants weren't really against abortion until around that time when religious leaders were looking for a more effective message than ""be racist"" to get protestants to vote for Republicans. In contrast, Catholics were always against abortion.  It's weird to me that Christians were alive during that time never talk about that change. They just act like it was always like this. | lol wut?

You wanna dog my reading comprehension and then attack me for something I never said?

Are you a real person? Lmao | >evolution is still a theory

A theory in science is different to a theory in everyday context. It's basically the highest level of explanation something can be given, something that is taken as fact unless something comes to disprove it

>you can‚Äôt prove it no matter how hard you try clown child üíÄ

The amount of evidence for evolution is ridiculous, literal primary schoolers get taught this stuff. Yet you're too stubborn to listen to any of itüíÄ | Stay in school kiddo | What's your explanation then smart guy? The amount of evidence we have for this stuff is incredible, if you only you got up off your ass and researched it | Surely this is a joke.

Okay boomer. | Getting mad and yelling at the grandkids she _adnittedly doesn't know well_ will definitely be the way to make those kiddos feel safe and happy in her presence and want to give her a hug. /s

No! It's on Grammy to be understanding of kids' anxieties, of their lack of familiarity, and to try to bridge the gap EMOTIONALLY. She's the fucking grownup. Meemaw gets to play the part of ADULT with a modicum of compassion and critical thinking skills when faced with ACTUAL CHILDREN who are, like most children, shy around grownups they don't know. 

I don't know how, in two thousand twenty four, you are still asking for the KIDS to be responsible for the ADULT'S emotions, but here we are. 

You should stop, though. It's dumb and disrespectful. | >Of course there are reasons, but have some sympathy for a grandparent, who hardly ever sees her grandkids, and just wants a little hug. That is not perverse, that is not perverted, that is not imposing, that‚Äôs just being a family.

Thinking that you're owed a hug, regardless of the kids' desires, is incredibly disrespectful. | That story doesn‚Äôt change anything. A grandparent‚Äôs feelings do not override or take precedence over a child‚Äôs autonomy. Teaching a kid that they should hug their grandparents (which is rude and imposing) or else they‚Äôll feel sad will make them think it‚Äôs okay for someone to guilt them into physical contact. Which then could lead to abuse and/or being taken advantage of. Especially with little girls who think they owe a guy a hug or they‚Äôll make him sad. 

I will never feel bad for teaching my kids their body is theirs and they alone decide what happens to it. The only examples are making sure they practice proper hygiene, they‚Äôre vaccinated, making sure their clothing is weather appropriate, etc.

Did you speed 5 miles over on that one stretch of road? Did you toss batteries in the garbage? Did you mail something with a lithium battery to your cousin via fed ex and forgot to disclose that there was a lithium battery in the box?

It‚Äôs subtle, and you don‚Äôt usually think about it, but it‚Äôs true. Yet, so many people view morality and law as black and white when most of us are operating under a sea of grey. | Picking their nose | Pee in the shower | Pretend not to know things.

Aren't we all? | Judge others | One thing I think everyone secretly does but won‚Äôt admit is scrolling through old photos on their phones or social media. We all have that moment of nostalgia when we see a picture from years ago, and then we find ourselves lost in a rabbit hole, reminiscing about memories, old friendships, or even cringeworthy moments from our past.

Or as my dumbass recently did, saying yes without thinking about the consequences... | peeing in the pool | cheating and telling lies | [deleted] | watch pornography | I piss in a bottle to go toilet | There is absolutely nothing that every single person on the entire planet does 

Although it's amusing watching people assume everybody on the planet does the same things they do | Bite their toenails off | Pee in the pool ü§ê | (Men) rub their balls and smell your fingers. Idk why but there's something enticing about that fishy copper smell. | Liking how your farts smell.

I had a party once but on the day, I was sick and stuck in bed. Never one to ruin a party, I said 'come anyway and party without me'. My bedroom was right next to the bathroom and over the course of the night, I realised that about 70-90%  of my friends just pee and go (numbers increasing with booze consumption). They definitely weren't slobs in general, just very lax on hand hygiene apparently | Pee in the shower? Jerk off every day? | Pee in the tub | Fantasize about their own death | Watching porn | Nibble on your poop | smell your own taint | Everyday masterbation | Lick door knobs | Using a hand or a finger when on their own to pleasure themselves üòâ | Eat their boogers just saw a men yesterday doing it üòÇü§¢ | Women cheat emotionally and sexually theough romance novels written by people not inside of the relationship, and then blame guys for porn.

Talk about stupid | Jerks off in public | You can‚Äôt imagine how difficult it is to train people in skilled trades because of this. With all the conviction in the world ‚Äúyes I can do that, no problem at all‚Äù. Come back 5 mins later and it‚Äôs completely upside down and backwards. Please, I want to help you be successful. I can‚Äôt when you keep telling me you know already. | And pretend to comfort. Sometimes I don‚Äôt know how to comfort others, but I still say something that seems to comfort them, such as it‚Äôs okay, don‚Äôt cry, etc. | I know exactly what you‚Äôre talking about! <*nodding intensifies*> | I have severe ADHD and it's very hard for me to focus when someone is talking. I try REALLY hard because I don't want to be rude. But sometimes I'll complete zone out, become unaware of my surroundings and completely forget what I'm in the middle of doing. I have no control over it. Then I come back to reality and I'm like fuck that's right, someone's talking to me. I try to respond in appropriate way and just pray that it's right. | Or the reverse, and everyone automatically assumes you know what to do | I fake it just so I can end the conversation | I do the opposite of this lol because usually I don‚Äôt want to talk to people about things.  

Like I‚Äôm HEAVILY into politics and even am involved in local politics a lot, but when people ask me about politics I say I don‚Äôt keep up with it because it‚Äôs too complicated for me. | I wish I had learned in school to speak up when I didn‚Äôt understand something. Because there was so much I didn‚Äôt understand. ADHD meant I couldn‚Äôt focus on all of your words until the end of the sentence and embarrassment made me not get clarification. 

I think of it as my super power now to say. ‚ÄúI actually didn‚Äôt understand any of that can you ELI5‚Äù sometimes I have to Google it then ask them to repeat. 

Life is simpler when you understand! | I've done the opposite so many times just too make sure I heard the disrespect before I go mad lol | Why does that sound so accurate? Honestly, I think you're probably right. | This or not actually hearing but too shy to say. | Sometimes it‚Äôs about the people who we talk to because wdym I‚Äôm listening to something without knowing the full context | I agree that people do this , but i didagree that they will not admit to it. People talk about this all the time and often jokes made about like oh i didnt hear it well but i just said yes | Exactly! *looks confused* | I feel like that was ingrained early in my childhood out of a fear of not fitting into a social group in school | This is why I often drop the ""did you get what I just said? alright, then explain it to me"" and things get uncomfortable. | Ugh as someone hard of hearing, this hits home. | I know exactly what you mean. | I do that for stuff I don‚Äòt really care about anyway all the time :O

But in my job it drives me crazy. ‚ÄûDo it like that - understood?‚Äú ‚ÄûYes‚Äú ‚ÄûShow me‚Äú proceeds in doing it wrong | I work as a sign language interpreter and you won‚Äôt believe how common this is for Deaf people who have to interact with hearing people without an interpreter. We call it ‚Äòthe Deaf nod‚Äô .. it makes me sad that they‚Äôd rather pretend they understand than tell someone that they need to come to the table with better communication rather than assuming they‚Äôre able to lip read | As a kinda deaf person I do that quite often. The only problem is, when they ask a question about the thing you did not understand and you have to fake it. | I only did that when i was in a different country and was still learning the language...other wise if there's something that i don't understand i will say it and ask to please explain, there's should be no shame about learning something new | I always thought I was the only one that nodded like a moron and fake laughed in a noisy bar or atmosphere. No idea how people can carry a conversation in a place like that. |  Yeah, faking understanding definitely resonates with a lot of us. It‚Äôs wild how often we nod along, even when we have no clue what's being talked about. It‚Äôs all about keeping the flow of conversation, I guess, but it can lead to some awkward moments later on. You'd think with all the focus on transparency these days, more people would just admit when they don‚Äôt get it. | This 100%.  When I was a young professional,  it was almost exclusively the former.

Now, as I have aged and am far less affected by others' opinions and have greater self confidence, it is almost exclusively the latter. | You know, I called my whole team out on this the other day. Every single person was working on this monthly report. I came in as a new manager. I asked everyone what the reason for this report was and everyone was giving me superficial answers. Finally I asked them to walk me through it and not one single person understood the purpose of the report. 

They had been maintaining and tracking this report for months and didn‚Äôt even know what it was they were tracking. We ended up working out that this report doesn‚Äôt really provide anything tangible to us.,

So now we are looking into new ways to track progress. But we had a talk about feigning understanding and how it could lead to situations like this. And this wasn‚Äôt 1 or two people. This was 22 people who tracked this report, including our accounting team. | Also, the secret to manipulation in ""dianetics"" they say: if you know the vocabulary, people will think you know the industry. And they use that to coerce. Think: crypto currency. How many times have you heard or maybe even used ""blockchain"" or ""DeFi"" or ""fiat currency"" without really knowing what those mean? | Reminds of when I got my haircut from a lady with a completely incoherent lisp. My fingers were crossed on both hands the whole time under that tarp. | Throughout my childhood, and teens, I ALWAYS did this. Down to knowing about shows, movies, games, anything at all because I thought it would help me fit in. I had undiagnosed ADHD until adulthood, and I wonder if it was sort of a masking technique for me. I‚Äôve developed so much more self confidence and am proud of who I am as an individual, and have made so much progress with this in particular. It‚Äôs now not embarrassing for me to say ‚Äúno I‚Äôve never seen that, tell me about it?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not understanding, can you explain?‚Äù. People love to talk more about what they love, and if they respond negatively it reflects on their character, not yours! | I learned a long time ago to just own it. I will ask questions especially if I sense that others don‚Äôt understand either. It is shocking how many times I will ask a question to ensure I understood what was being said only to see 5 others nodding their head because they were also lost but unwilling to admit it. | I teach high school science and this is the bane of my existence. | I don't fake understanding anything and it drives me crazy when others do it. It just seems like such a stupid and disrespectful waste of time to me and until now, I didn't know it was so common. Of all the people I've known, I thought only my family members and exes did that, which is one of the many reasons I don't talk to any of them, and I thought they only did it to me out of disrespect. Now I'm wondering if they're just like that with everyone and I'm wondering how anything ever gets accomplished if this is normal for people to do. 

The way I see it, it's the difference between ignorance, which is easily forgivable and fixable, and stupidity, which is neither imo. People are such a weird species to me. Don't they realize the longer you fake understanding, the longer it takes to learn. Why would anyone choose that? I can't think of anything more stupid.

Downvoting a comment about how it's stupid to choose to be stupid is as stupid as it gets. I suppose I should have expected idiots to be proud of their lack of intellect but I obviously gave them too much credit. | I think about this every now and again too. Like somebody I met or talk to 10 or 15 years ago. And it'll be clear across the country where you meet them. And you really hit it off and had a good conversation. Then 20 years later you wonder do they ever think about me sometimes like I think about them. | But this is a really interesting thought!

I think of lots of my high school friends. Not often but maybe once a year or so? Also there are a few people who I had one off conversations with and have never seen again who I'll occasionally recall.

It'd be interesting to know what impression I've left on people. You know? Like do the same people recall me? I suspect not all of them... But I also suspect some people recall me whom I would struggle to remember myself... | Considering I have a solid number of people not in my life anymore I still think about I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs possible. But it‚Äôs also likely that it‚Äôs not the folks you think. | Sometimes, I wonder if they actually mention an old memory involving me to somebody if it was significant | They do. Some people and times just have a huge impact. Sometimes you forget a friend you had for an entire year. | You know what's funny, I literally never do this. I think about them and wonder what they're up to, but as I go through all the people that fit this description, I can't honestly say I've ever wondered if they think about me. I don't know what that says about me... But there it is. | I do not do this | I‚Äôve honestly never wondered this. I‚Äôve wondered about what people are up to, but not what they think of me. | I‚Äôm retired military. With single soldiers, being reassigned every couple of years was common. You make friends easily, knowing you will not be hanging out together long. As assignments are not the same start date, your friend may be gone in a week or a year. We tended to be able to pick up a conversation or friendship when and if we were again assign the same location. If not, they will ever be in memory and never aging, but not missed.  I maybe had a few thousand soldiers I knew by name in my 32 years. | Jokes on you, my memory for faces is a seive!!! | Hmm. That's interesting. I honestly can't say I've ever wondered if anyone from my past still thinks about me. I think about them, and wonder how they're doing, but it's honestly just never occurred to me to wonder if they think of me.¬† | Highly recommend the movie Before Sunrise, and its sequels. | I think about what every one in my kindergarten class is doing with their lives | When I was a child, I met an older woman on a train ride I took with my mom. The woman was so kind, she gave me a piggy keychain and talked to me about a book she was reading. She had left such an impression on me that, even tho I do not have the keychain anymore, I still remember the title of the book and often think about the woman and how kind she was. So I def do think that it happens, you often leave a bigger impression on sb than you think. | They don‚Äôt. | Nope. I've never done that (30M). Maybe I'm too young. | I talk to myself a lot and honestly it‚Äôs way more interesting than talking to some people I know in real life. | My brother talks to himself all the time and if you ask why he says ‚ÄúI make pretty good conversation‚Äù | I do this but not out loud, it‚Äôs a full conversation in my head with emotions ! Or is that day dreaming ? | I use to talk to myself until I found out how big of an asshole I am. I had to cut myself out of my life, I couldn't deal with my toxicity anymore. | Why would you hide that? | I talk to myself a lot.  The people that sit next to me at work have just started ignoring it as they know that is how I figure things out lol. | Oh I admit this freely.




But I seem to be admitting it to the wrong people, because they all be lookin at me like I'm crazy. | I talk to myself all the time, Sometimes you just need an expert opinion | Being able to ""explain"" by confirming that the various juices in your brain agree is easy, being able to speak it is different. Sometimes you have to speak it to see how much sense it really makes. If I can't explain it, I have to think about it more. | I'd like to think this is true but I have NEVER caught somebody talking to themselves so, is it?  That's where my mind's at. | I rehearse conversations way to much. Don't ask why... | I talk to myself and if people hear me I say I am talking to the dogs. | I talk to myself SO MUCH!!! | It's not a problem until you start using ""we"" instead of ""I""¬† | As someone with no running inner monologue, I always found this interesting. And it also makes people baffled that I don't! | I have found myself doing this more and more as I get older. Especially the days I am working remotely. | It can also help cement ideas and concepts by explaining something to someone, even it's explaining it out loud to yourself. | I never picked my nose. It was assigned to me at birth | I remember years back, sitting at traffic lights when a stunning blonde pulled up behind me in a very expensive sports car. I just sat having an admire for a minute, and watched as her index finger went up her nostril, had a good rummage around and came out again

She proceeded to inspect her finger for a minute before popping it in her mouth.

Ive never lost interest so quickly | At primary (elementary) school when your teacher reprimands you for it and then you walk in on them doing it. The first plot twist in life. | There are two kinds of people in the world - people who pick their noses, and liars. | HAAA!! As soon as I saw this post, I said ‚Äúobviously we‚Äôre all nose pickers.‚Äù And I was right!! | True lol | It wasn‚Äôt a pick, it was a rub (Seinfeld fans will get it) | You can pick your friends, you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your friend's nose | If you are ever in a job interview and they ask if you pick your nose, the best answer is sometimes in private, yes, I do. It can sometimes be used to guage how truthful someone is. | I fully admit that | Yup | Who doesn't admit to picking their noses? It's eating it, that people don't admit to. | And apparently eating snots builds an immune system but I don‚Äôt know how much of that is true | When my niece or nephews would get sick (stuffy nose) my BIL would pinch their nose between his index & middle fingers, pull away from their nose, make a fist & suck it up (effectively eating their snot). | Getting tinted car windows has been life changing in this department | Thank God lol | Oh yeah? Well the Jerk store called, and they‚Äôre running out of you! | Hell yes! üòÑ | This is very true haha sometimes I have to interrupt my train of thought, because more often than not, I get more mad or depressed at a situation hasn't even happened and probably never will. | *Prepared for the future | Firstly, I sort of hate myself for saying this, but I feel like you attract conflict when you imagine conflict.  

Aaaand I say this because I did the same thing for honestly as long as I could think, feel and imagine -  and I feel that the energy I‚Äôve put into the world has brought that stuff to me.  So I‚Äôve stopped thinking and imagining conflicts or high stakes situations for my own thrill or to keep me entertained while driving and listening to music.  

I read a really good book called ‚Äòbreaking the habit of being yourself‚Äô which really touched on this topic too about your mental energy. I think in some ways you could be manifesting. | Making up fake scenarios is a good practice. Retorts are good in all but making plans is good. It can mentally prepare you in case something happens. A few times I would theorize what I would do in an event I was followed by another car on the way home late at night. I shit you not last night I was followed home and around town (made circles around blocks to confirm). Since I planned for something like this I was not panicked and made it safely to a police station where they didn‚Äôt follow me. 

Of course planning for every possible scenario may be a bit extreme but it is definitely a good practice to plan for some things. | I used to work at a restaurant and I fantasized about a fight breaking out with some unruly customers.  I would save the day by smashing one of them with the pepper grinder.  I played it out in my mind over and over, my coworker in a headlock, me flying in, the hero. | I have never done this | I fully express my inner monologue out loud whenever I‚Äôm alone. It‚Äôs quite often that I‚Äôll lose my voice doing this. | Oh we all have full conversations no doubt there | The interesting thing about this is, as a non-native English speaker, I started talking to myself in English after living in the US and speaking English exclusively for 4-5 years. And I no longer talk to myself in my native tongue at all.

I can't pinpoint exactly when the switch happened and I'd assume it was very gradual, but one day I just realized that my dominant language has completely switched from my native tongue to English. | I be having full on conversations lol. Sometimes I wonder if it‚Äôs normal ü§£ | I definitely do this and sometimes it escapes from being all in my head and I start talking out loud LOL | It‚Äôs not a secret for me lol my manager once mentioned that I do this a lot. I told her sometimes it‚Äôs the best conversation I‚Äôve had all day. | Yes, true | I talk to myself a lot. When people find out that I do. I got strange looks so yeah. I'm pretty sure a lot of people don't say it | Not everyone does this. Some of us don't think with words¬† | ‚ÄúOf course I talk to myself, sometimes I need expert advice‚Äù not sure where the quote came from but I find it funny and there‚Äôs truth to it. I talk things out loud a lot when I‚Äôm working a problem. Helps me hear if there‚Äôs a good idea in what I‚Äôm thinking. | I am pretty sure literally everyone I know would cop to this | Sometimes I pretend like I'm some YouTuber doing a tutorial video on whatever it is I'm currently doing, as I try and figure it out. 
""Okay guys so for this next step, we're gonna have to-"" and there's no one else in the room with me | I will happily admit to this. | Yep. And then you realize someone overheard you and you try and go over in your head what you actually said and it if was embarrassing. | All the time. Only very very rarely out loud, but in my mind and often just moving my mouth definitely | Is it a worry, or a consolation, but it gets MUCH worse as you get older. | Nah man my car has heard full blown arguments and conversations | Soap operas wouldn‚Äôt exist without it! | I narrate my whole life lmao | I once happened upon my very bald dad as he was vexed with some piece of equipment refusing to work as it ought and heard him mutter ‚ÄúIf that don‚Äôt frost ya old bald head!‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt help but snicker a bit and asked if he‚Äôd said what I thought he did. Yup! I‚Äôd never heard him refer to his bald head in such a way before. | I for one, like to do that out loud

/s | Especially in the summer in New York. My eyes, my eyes! | I judge people because of their driving. | everyone will react differently if randomly approached by scruffy looking man in torn clothing and overgrown beard vs a man in a crisp suit carrying a briefcase. | I'll admit to it.


Not admitting to it is just stupid. Appearances give away a lot of information.¬† | Idk if this counts, but I used to think that belly button piercings were slutty... 
...then my little sis told me about someone I'd known for years that had one- I hadn't seen it before bc I'm not big on swimming and that's the only time they had it visible. 
So really it's that the people who SHOW OFF a belly piercing are slutty- plenty of people may have one and you might not even know | I‚Äôve been doing that a lot recently. | It's when you stop questioning that the problems start. | You should. Why else are you the only one posting in this thread? | In her monologues am i right | Oddly enough, not everyone has an inner monologue. 

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/not-everyone-has-an-inner-voice-streaming-through-their-head/ | most people think in a combination of words and images. some people don't have an inner monologue. I have aphantasia and have to concentrate to picture even a blob. some people with aphantasia can't even do that. when people used to say ""picture this"" I thought it was a metaphor. however I am a very creative person with an active imagination, I just think about ideas in a different way. | I don't do that, and definitely don't eat it. | Yes, we all do it! Even if you‚Äôre saying something positive about someone you‚Äôre still technically talking behind their back. But we have all had a bitch session in our lives, even if it was just once. | Well, the only way to avoid this is to make sure everyone is facing you when you speak. | If you think about it, aren‚Äôt you really *in front* of their back? | Every time I fart in the grocery store or in public someone walks right through it immediately after üôÉ | I try to find a quiet more secluded place and just let one rip lol. But don‚Äôt fall for the fart with earbuds in and nobody can hear it scam. They absolutely can hear it. | Let it out slowly so that it won't make a sound.. if you have a feeling of it having a sound you make a noise to draw out the sound of it | Exactly, every single one | Pre-k teacher here..the amount of farts I left and and blamed it on kids is ridiculous lol | Girls don't Fart tho | I don't fart in public, unless you consider public toilets ""in public"". I absolutely hate smelling other people's farts, so I make sure to fart in a bathroom or outside away from others. I also do this at home. I don't want to make my wife smell my farts, so I will go to the bathroom and do it. All you public farters should be shunned and forced to do community service for your crimes. | I always pray that nobody‚Äôs behind me when that happens | Girls don‚Äôt fart! Omg! | My friends all know I‚Äôm a very flatulent person. I have IBS, LOVE dairy but dairy doesn‚Äôt love me. I fart all the time. I distinctly remember giving up trying to hold in or fart silently when I was in my early teens. It was too much effort. 
  
I work in childcare and it was an awesome place to cover up my farts. Just blame it on the kids. It worked for ages. But I had to fess up when all my coworkers were running around trying to find the kid who pooped..but it was just me farting and I couldn‚Äôt contain my laughter.   
  
Now at work they ask who‚Äôs pooped or is it just me farting. I‚Äôm okay with it. | My sister farted while in a store with my mom and then made a big scene blaming my mom. Fun note, my sister was probably in her late 20s when she did it. Mom was not amused. | I talk to myself about anything and everything üòÇ | A lot of people are saying this and, while I have a bit of an inner monologue, I don‚Äôt do this very often. Instead, I tend to ‚Äúimagine‚Äù if you will scenarios or situations and how I would react to them. But it‚Äôs much more visual for me in my head than audio (thought dialogue does exist at times still) | Yes! I know if I open it a third time that sandwich will make itself. | I mean, it makes sense! The hungrier you get, the lower your standards get, right? | There's two types of people in this world. Those that masturbate, and those that lie. | It is kinda interesting that this comes up, yet it is not entirely true. | To guys its natural. But girls? Yes we do it too | Even famous actors do it - like Bill Pullman. | I honestly don‚Äôt though lol | speak for yourself | Who doesnt admit that? Maybe in the US. In Germamy its absolutely normal, even for me as a women ;) | Exactly, everybody does it | Disagree. My wife has not masturbated in years. | This is a touchy subject. | Not if you have a low libido. | I usually do this to keep a convo flowing, especially if someone's super interested in what their talking about | I really should do that. I'm decent in a flowing, back-and-forth conversation, but speaking more than three sentences or explaining myself, or telling an anecdote, my mind goes blank pretty quickly | Repress? | Sometimes when I'm bored in a meeting, I try to think of the absolute worst, most offensive, personal, immediately fireable offense I could blurt out. | There‚Äôs something about Futurama season 1. I saw it at the premiere and at least 7 times since. | Is this for the re watching of a show part or the counting? I rewatched shows or movies before. Not sure how many times because I don't count them | Ooh ooh ah ah look how *big* it is | Nah, lots of people don't do this. I find porn really off-putting. | There are plenty of people that don‚Äôt watch porn. | Listen! The cake/pie will probably go bad if we don‚Äôt eat it soon! The fact that it‚Äôs less than 24 hrs old means nothing! | Lol, so true | It has fruit in it, I have fruit for breakfast. Therefore this apple pie is in deep shit. | If donuts count, then I do it pretty often | Believe it or not, there are people out there without a sugar addiction | Most here are Americans we‚Äôve all had pancakes lol but I guess if your European then that‚Äôs true probably | I don't think in any asian culture people eat dessert for breakfast? its nauseous for me just to think about it lol | LOL the presumption in here. There is no way I am so utterly special that I'm the only person on the planet who doesn't do this. Now I'll eat breakfast for dinner but how does your stomach even physically handle eating dessert for breakfast? Wouldn't you get sick? | Is too much sugar count as desert? if so yes I eat desert for breakfast.. its called cereal nowadays | I semi-regularly eat nachos for breakfast. I do put a lot of veggies on them (no meat, vegetarian) so I tell myself they are almost salads. Which is also weird to eat for breakfast, but better for the body. | Pancakes are cakes | If donuts and cinnamon rolls count then I don‚Äôt think this is a secret | Sugary cereals and large corn syrup muffins have lead us down this path. We may joke it was cold pizza that was our gateway misstep to poor breakfast decisions, but we all know the name: donuts | Most breakfast cereal is basically dessert anyway. They're almost all just pure sugar. | Nope. I don't even have desserts, period.¬† | I think everyone daydreams or fantasizes about exciting scenarios‚Ä¶but I think these scenarios differ pretty significantly between the sexes. üòÇ | I mean, if you didn't look, you are just left to guess when to stop? I really don't understand that an alternative exists | I think it would be more embarrassing to admit that you don‚Äôt check. Imagine proudly proclaiming that, for all you know, your butt is still swimming in feces. | Thank you! I've waited 29 years for someone to confirm what I already knew. | I'm confused. How else would you be wiping your butt and why would you do this secretly? | Pissing is ok. Waffle stomping, now, that's not... | Probably used to be more common than now, the family doctor told me years ago to piss on your feet in the shower and you won‚Äôt get warts on your feet ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èdoubt that‚Äôs common advice nowadays | It's all pipes. | I piss while taking a shower because pissing while taking a bath would be disgusting | Used to when I was younger. And then I became a germaphobe. | I don‚Äôt, our showers aren‚Äôt hooked up to septic but to the grey water tank. | nah, don't like that smell at all... | There are 2 kinds of people in the world. People who piss in the shower, and dirty fucking liars. | Nah I don't do that, just piss before you get in or hold it til you're out, it isn't hard. | I‚Äôve never pissed into the shower, but I‚Äôve definitely pissed from my shower to my toilet. The genius who built my house put them right next to each other | So so true and nobody will admit it | Oh honestly, I have never done it. I've tried it once but it just wouldn't flow. Maybe some kind of mental barrier?¬† | People don't do this?? you will be washing it off tho when you shower | DIFFERENT PIPES GO TO DIFFERENT PLACES | This is so gross but I keep seeing subs here where everybody claims that everybody does it. No not everybody does it. I don't. I can't even imagine. In fact it's difficult for me to believe that so many people actually do this. So gross. Standing in your own piss. Especially women. It's not like we can grab it and aim. Pissing all over your feet and stuff? No thank you. I'm not so lazy that I can't walk the couple of feet to my toilet..... | and smell the finger | Get deep up in there, fingernails going to town on them dingleberrys, work that bunghole until it‚Äôs raw | I‚Äôm a fucking weirdo and I still don‚Äôt do this.. | As a person without a penis I can firmly say I have never done this ü§£ | Nah man my wiener is way to small, it‚Äôs already retracted lime a scared turtle | Would you fuck me I would fuck me!

>GOODBYE HORSES! | I've never done this and never will ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | Only about 50% of people do this. | half of the population does not do this | Front? Never did that, but the back... | I‚Äôve never and I don‚Äôt get it. My sweaty balls smell like sweaty balls? What a surprise. | No‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ | \*sniff\* \*sniff\*...aaaahhhhh | lol | I'm quirky in public | Checking to see it all flushes.  Just good manors at the end of the day .

I'm sure we all have had a double flusher | >easier to breathe

How big are your boogers??? | Only Queenslanders pick their noses and they eat it too! | Ooh. I love Jenga | Go Fish can be sad sometimes. | No, you're the one lying. | Stalking, no. Curious where that long lost friend from high school ended up, and going down the rabbit hole, maybe. | My belly button never itched. Why would I scratch it? | And sniff? | Thought this would have more love | I am too scared to look | I know that, by denying it, I'm fulfilling the, ""everyone will never admit"", but I have never done that, and am not curious to, either. | Haven't tried it but thanks for the idea. | I always do that | I'm not sure i remember doing this for this specific reason | ive never done that | I've never done that!

I have, however, used the camera in my phone.. | I don't have the vision for such a thing | Haha, what in the hell did i just read?? ü§® No way anyone is staring into that black hole üòê | Guess I still have a first to do but I am fine to keep it that way. | That‚Äôs called discretion. | [deleted] | Guilty üò≠ sometimes im too scared of whatever is rotting in there to open the lid. | Do you mean look up their social media to see what they've posted or stalk them in real life?¬† | Girls especially love snooping through people‚Äôs social media. I‚Äôm convinced we do it way more than guys do. I do it occasionally myself but I have two female friends who could put Joe Goldberg to shame with the info they can dig up. | Before I add someone I google them first lol. | Uhhh¬† | So true! | That‚Äôs just this mornings playlist! | It's one's own recipe; how can we not kinda like it? | I'm happy to admit it¬† | Costanza, is that you? | Came here to say exactly that! | My fake high school ex boyfriend from another state agrees with you. üòÇ | Falling in love romantically while in a committed relationship is the worst kind of cheating! Emotional cheating is far more painful and damaging than just a physical fling. | Lol, you right tho | Why? There‚Äôs no way they‚Äôll be fit to wear again before washing so no point in smelling them. | Yep! | Is this a thing people don‚Äôt admit? I feel like it‚Äôs weirder if you admit you DON‚ÄôT masturbate. Well depending on your age | So true | What? No, that's absolutely not normal! | When I was about 10 yo I asked my friends if they ever thought about that, and they all looked at me like I'd just strangled a puppy. | Yeah, I'm pretty sure most people don't do that. I'm definitely in the other group, but I'm still convinced that the majority of people don't do it | No‚Ä¶that‚Äôs absolutely not normal. I hope you‚Äôre doing okay. If you‚Äôre struggling with this, please seek out professional help. | then sniff the offending finger | I don't think everyone has enemies... | Found that one out when my husband‚Äôs friend asked us for a threesome and said he had been having fantasies about both of us for a long time. We didn‚Äôt have the threesome. | We should be friends dude‚Ä¶ wait, are you married? | What? Why would this be bad? I mean, you make super, you put the leftovers in the fridge, you eat it for lunch. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I don't get why this would be a secret? | If you are struggling, you would do this a lot and won't care what other people think | Why would someone not admit to this? | Having lunch next day is one of the main reasons why I make a little extra the night before. Little bit of meal prep.  What‚Äôs wrong with leftovers? | ... Why would you feel the need to do this secretly exactly? I'm confused. | I‚Äôm missing half a story here. | I‚Äôve got that with a lot of crimes including but not limited to theft, blackmail, murder and terrorism. 

With the exception of events like 9/11, terrorists usually really suck at what they do. As a terrorist you want to create chaos, fear and suffering. They rarely plan to maximise that. I‚Äôm not going to explain in detail what you should do here because I don‚Äôt want to risk someone actually doing it. Let‚Äôs just say the world should be glad I have no intention of ever being a terrorist. | Assuming they can read | No man no | You promised that would stay between us! | I think this is more of a teenager thing. As an adult, I feel a lot more comfortable disagreeing with someone. | I don‚Äôt think everyone cheats (on their partners anyway) but I did cheat on a test in 7th grade. Everyone lies though, even if it‚Äôs a white lie. ‚ÄúNo your ass doesn‚Äôt look fat in that outfit‚Äù | Nope | I mean if I‚Äôm like reading a dense textbook or some complicated instructions I‚Äôm trying to figure out, sure. But not like novels or articles or Reddit posts. My mouth can‚Äôt move as fast as my eyes can | Uhh no | who doesnt admit this lol | I piss out of my window at night | Breathing oxygen, boom roasted | You're taking things too seriously | if your balls smell like fishy copper you need to shower my man | ......wtf | Nope | From someone who has invulnerability (!) been very close to it many times. Yes, you are right. Every judgement call we make in dangerous circumstances is basically fantasising about what could go wrong, including death. 

We can only die once, it‚Äôs normal to want to make it count. Many songs and stories have been written about it. It‚Äôs only natural. | Lol, I think you're on your own with that one. | What? | Is anyone that flexible? | Nope

Many people don't do it everyday 

Some people don't do it at all | Never done it | Are you saying you do this too? | While I can see somewhat of a point you‚Äôre trying to make, I think your point maybe have gotten lost in the weeds of a misogyny.

Women reading novels and building a fantasy in their head is not much different than you seeing a movie star and thinking about adventures with them, or hell even you reading a book and having the experience yourself. Fantasy is fantasy, until it gets played in reality which let‚Äôs be honest is highly unlikely. Until then, there has been no cheat.

Other than misogynistic your comment reeks of anti-education rhetoric. Might I suggest cracking a book yourself and diving into a fantastical adventure of some kind? I think it'd be good for you and offer you perspective as books tend to do. | Dont do that... | I have found I have gotten very different results by rephrasing some questions. ¬†For instance: ¬†

‚ÄúAm I making sense?‚Äù VS the standard ‚Äúdoes that make sense?‚Äù

By putting the burden of understanding on the speaker instead of the listener you get much more honest replies.

Try it. | You show them how to do it, then watch them do it....not sure why you are taking their word for it lol | Early 2009 as a very green electrical apprentice, my foreman let me know (and a few others in ear shot) that I would be wiring a doorbell in a loading dock after coffee break. This was well beyond my capabilities and he knew it, looking for me to flounder and struggle or pass the job off. As confidently as I could I just agreed. No problem. 
Luckily smart phones had come out and spent the brief coffee break studying pictures of diagrams on the internet and successfully wired the doorbell to his, my and several others surprise. I have years worth of these examples. Except bending pipe‚Ä¶that‚Äôll expose you. | I‚Äôm a big believer in there‚Äôs no such thing as  dumb question in the workplace, if I don‚Äôt know something or how to do something i‚Äôd rather ask somebody than wing it and make a mistake i have to rectify it later | Well, oftentimes in the trades you have bosses that teach you whether you fuck it up or ask for clarity you are going to be treated the same way. Might as well learn something by trying it before you get yelled at rather than ask a question and get treated like crap. | Used to run a kitchen and hated people not asking questions and then getting it wrong. Pivoted into a different trade, and now I might ask too many questions. I never want to be that person that fakes understanding and then fucks it all up. Sometimes, though, I wish I had that confidence to just tackle stuff without the questions. | There's a big difference between understanding something in principle and doing it. | Oh yeah I couldn‚Äôt imagine doing that lmao¬†


I‚Äôll pretend to understand something I don‚Äôt really care about in a casual conversation.¬†

I‚Äôm not going to pretend to understand something I‚Äôll be responsible for and especially could break.¬† | You are responsible for them being able to do it. If they can't, you have failed regarding that responsibility.


That's why important commands in the military are always repeated by the receiver instead of just acknowledged.


Come up with a similar process that fits your craft.


When I taught math to a single student for example I tried to never ever do any step myself but let the student do every step and just guide them at every step as much as necessary.


You're always responsible for your responsibility, that's why it is your responsibility - and your honor. | This. | That's very sweet of you. It sounds like you do know how to support. Although crying is healthy and I think best to nurture those moments without telling them not to | I would say that you really don't need to know how to comfort to actually comfort someone. Just being there to listen is comforting enough because it simply shows them that someone is there for them. So that calm, ""Hey... don't worry, don't cry..."" translates to, ""Hey, you know I'm here for you..."" which is a very comforting thing to experience. | I hate this because I do it by instinct, rather than just asking what they mean. And by the time I think ""they'd be fine if I just said what do you mean by that"", it's too late to go back and admit that I was lying | What's memorable to one person is often forgettable to others. I'm sure it happens but I think it's way more common that the people you think about sometimes don't think about you at all and that there are others who think about you sometimes that you don't even remember. Someone out there right now who's essentially a total stranger to you is hoping you're doing well because something that didn't mean much to you at the time made a huge impression on them. | The answer is no, I never think about you. | This one is hard after you've grown into a better person. I want to reach out to so many people to let them know I wish I could take back my words. I've learned and grown. But I don't think people would like me doing that, bringing up old shit out of the blue. I think that would be just for me and my internal comfort. Even if I randomly came in their minds over time, the knowledge that I've changed doesn't change any hurt I created. | I have some HS friends that are on my FB friends list. I commented on a post about working somewhere when I was 17-18 and this friend commented that she worked there too and didn‚Äôt remember me there. I had to laugh because I supervised the weekend customer service crew (we started at 5:30 AM and it was a small group) and had to talk to her about not showing up or showing up late‚Äîbut she didn‚Äôt remember me. ?! Also we had a shared trauma that we discussed in HS, so I thought for sure she‚Äôd remember me. Nope. LOL I didn‚Äôt post about supervising HER and just reiterated that I did indeed work there/my responsibilities. 

Another co-worker who was 10 years older than me, left on maternity leave at a different job and I took over her job. We remained friends and I was around for both of her kids being little, visited bringing gifts, sent Christmas cards to each other, etc. I have a unique first name and when a mutual friend mentioned me recently‚Äîshe had no clue who I was. LOL Granted, this is now 30+ years later. Apparently, I was very forgetful to some‚Äîyet other mangers, co-workers, and friends spoke/speak highly of me. We all have very different interpretations of our relationships with others. It‚Äôs so fascinating to me. | High school friends for sure. I grew up and still live in a small town. My close friends have moved away and I regularly take a walk around town and it makes me feel like a ghost haunting this place that used to be filled with people I knew. A lot of places trigger memories of people and things I did with them. The school we went has changed and the kids that go there were not even born when we went there, but they are living the same lives we did. In your head you kind of think the world you leave behind will stay in stay the same cause that‚Äôs how your memories work. But the world moves on without you and nothing stays the same. | For real tho. I'm funny, insightful, and have a lot of interesting thoughts. | People think speaking their internal monolog is a sign of being crazy. Just about everyone does it subconsciously. | My SIL has been caught speeding by the same camera twice, both times documented with the index finger deeply planted in one nostril. | Well that's the beauty (or not) of modern plastic surgery! | r/Angryupvote | You still got the same one you were born with? | Dad? | I picked mine a few times before I learned my mouth is faster than my hands. I'm a slow learner.  

Mf sitting sideways now. | This is a well-known psychological trick to get people to stop staring at you | So that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve never understood‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not gonna pretend I don‚Äôt pick my nose ever, I‚Äôm a human being sometimes you got to clear out‚Ä¶but eating it?! Why? What‚Äôs appetizing about it? | I came to say that I learned awhile ago that so many women choose to pick their nose at red lights. | Watching live feeds of ‚ÄúBig Brother‚Äù where cameras are rolling 24/7, there are always people picking their skin or nose and then eating it. ü§¢ | The truth is in the boogers. | r/technicallythetruth | There may have been some incidental penitration, but she was in no position to make that call! | Not with that attitude. | But your ent can. | You can scratch your dog and you can scratch your balls, but you can‚Äôt scratch your dog‚Äôs balls. | That depends how heavy the nose is!¬† | I have a friend who literally does try to pick other people's noses sometimes when he's drunk. Worst trait, and that's saying something | I heard this woman years ago (on NPR I think) talking about MRSA and it was so scary I quit nose picking cold turkey. | But not always, because maybe they really don't pick their nose. I'm sure there must be some people out there who never pick their nose, just like I'm sure that there's extraterrestrial life somewhere out there; I've yet to see any evidence, but statistically, they pretty much have to exist. | I've read recently that it potentially cause dementia too | Yeah, well, I had sex with your wife! | Christ! you don't have to murder them | What's the difference? You're their all-time best seller! | What‚Äôs the difference? You‚Äôre their all time best seller! | what's the difference?  you're their all time best seller! | are you trolling? | I heard that smart people talk to themselves a lot | Constant. Like it worries me sometimes, but I've always done it and I guess I'm ok. 

I honestly don't understand how people don't do this | I dont. Not out loud. Just in my head | Full on conversations, all the time. Always with the accommodating movie. Music is optional. As long as the conversations are going, if they stop, the music isnt optional anymore. | I've been guilty of doing it whenever I knew that I was heading into a conversation that's uncomfortable but important to have with family or friends | Me myself and I have some of the most lively conversations | Do you dream in your native tongue though? I‚Äôm always curious about this | This happens/happened to me too. After I started working in a predominantly English-speaking advertising industry, my self-convos switched more to English. Do use my native tongue from time to time but rare these days. | This is really interesting. If you don‚Äôt think in words, do you think in pictures? Are they black-and-white or colour pictures? Has this always been the case or have you trained yourself to do this? | To what? Talking to yourself or not thinking with words? | Absolutely but we don't all react the same way as each other. If they're both behaving the same way when they approach, I'm more likely to react better to the scruffy guy. | I'd see this logic working with nipple piercings. | I‚Äôm not questioning my sanity anymore I‚Äôve just excepted that I don‚Äôt have any lol. | Have you though?¬†


How would you know? You're obviously crazy. | Todd there‚Äôs no woman here man | How dare you talk about me behind my back right in front of my face... | We all do it. I do try to make sure that I don‚Äôt say anything that I wouldn‚Äôt also say to someone‚Äôs face. Maybe in a nicer way! I‚Äôm not always successful but sometimes people just suck! | Fart in the cheese aisle, they'll think it's some expensive cheese | Man the other night I was all alone at work just ripping ass left and right. My coworker came into the office and immediately complained about the smell of the trash. Perfect crime | Crop dusting in the grocery store | I crop dusted an entire Big Lots. Then farted directly on a little girl in an Asian grocery store not 5 minutes later. | Fr me too | If you ever want service somewhere and no one is around, a fart is guaranteed to bring someone straight away
Has not failed yet, the wrinkle of the nose from them is a giveaway though | Omg, that reminds me of my mother. She started losing her hearing and either didn't believe it or assumed everyone else did too because she'd yell out all her horribly judgemental and insulting thoughts about strangers in public while only a few feet away from them. I'd tell her they can hear everything she's saying and she'd just laugh and yell ""no they can't."" I really hate that woman. | What kind of noise? A fart noise? | Like a horse neigh... or? | I m sorry, they do | I swear I smelt something behind my seat partner today | I fart in your general direction! | I agree fully! Reddit has this idea that if you don't fart in front of your spouse then you're not really comfortable with them or something. For the 10+ years I've been married, I've never knowingly farted in front of my spouse - yes, small hotel rooms or stomach distress happens or whatever, but we're as discreet and private about bodily functions as we can be. Certainly same in public or with friends, it's just gross to subject people to that | This. People are gross and I don‚Äôt want to be around anyone who is just comfortable ripping farts in public | I've then said to myself I need to stop talking to myself | Or somehow there'll be desert that you somehow didn't see the first 2 times XD | Hey, I can do two things at once if I want to. | Yeah like. Its normal üôÉ why do people care so much | There's a man who doesn't go gentle into the night! | & Gilbert Gottfried | And comedians like‚Ä¶ oh, whats his name? Buddy Whack-it? | Sure. Right now... Typing with letf hand. | He can't, he's deaf and his hands are busy | Most of Europe is less stuck up about sex than North Americans. Lol. | Whenever you get the US out of your mind you‚Äôll feel a lot better about yourself | I read Germamy in the voice of Bernie Mac | Uff, then you are in for a suprise. | Nuh uh | That you know of! | Same here. She doesn't like it. | Repress is synonymous with restrain, prevent, inhibit, suppress and subdue. | And also, lots of people are pretty open about doing it | me too. I find it hard to focus as it is, so my train of thought: ""let's put a video on... oh I hope these actors weren't coerced.. or trafficked.... trafficking is awful,  people are awful etc"" or more innocently like they're in a living room and there's a fruit bowl: ""oh fruit.. I need to put fruit on the shopping list.. what else do I need.. bread... milk... etc"" either way not a turn on. | Lies every one has a sugar addiction. Maybe people with diabetes don‚Äôt have as much of one but they still do have one. | Yep | I mean, the American breakfast shown in media is often just, like, donuts. Toast with jelly and a glass of orange juice or a bowl of sugary cereal and milk. Desserts, save for cultural context. | Dessert. Desert has sand. | Ooo tell me about yours! | Non-bidet mfs be like: | Jokes on u, my butt can't swim. | Right? Brown for keep wiping, red for stop | Yeah I don‚Äôt think that guy was actually a doctor | Madonna said something like that on Letterman in the 90's. She was like, ""you should pee in the shower because it helps prevent athlete's foot"".

I say if she's peeing in the shower it's good enough for me. | I'll call a plumber right now! | I am disgusting | Water splashing out of the toilet when you pee is probably a lot dirtier than the water in your shower. | If there are germs in your cum you've got bigger problems | Extra Nitrogen for the plants! | Can I suggest drinking more water? | You have found the one outlier: it‚Äôs me | You can shit in the - *am I done yet?* | I take baths so I get out if I have to piss and go to the toilet | I freely admit it. It‚Äôs not like I plug up the drain and dance a little jig in it - I‚Äôm pissing in the drain, standing on a nonporous surface, drenched in a literal shower of clean water, about to cover myself in soap. Some of the water I already drank plus whatever my kidneys are dumping etc really isn‚Äôt the grossest thing that comes out of me.¬† | Not even on Reddit. I'm one in a krillion | If you've got the skill, you can aim it right into the drain just fine, even if you're female! No need to go on this whole tirade bruh, just admit you're a pleb and move on üòÇ | Same this one baffles me, more so at how adamant people are about this and how we are seen as the exceptions. I just don‚Äôt get the appeal of doing it when we can just use the toilet first. | You realize the piss washes away instantly right? And not only that but you don‚Äôt aim for yourself, and even if some gets on you, you‚Äôre in the shower?? It‚Äôs the cleaner version of pissing in a pool, I think your extreme disgust and shaming is unjustified and unnecessary. | girls just gotta lean their hips forward, put a step between their legs, and do it down the drain. if that‚Äôs so gross, i do not recommend pools, hot tubs, or bodies of water. | I don‚Äôt do it. Perhaps as a child I did (not judging) just saying that now that I have to clean that up. Nope. | Wtf? | Bro‚Ä¶ | Of course you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôre a fucking weirdo | You're missing out on telling yourself you'd fuck yourself | We growers can never relate to the showers. | it's the intensity of the ""sweaty balls"" is what we identify. | How would you know it don't smell if u don't sniff? | Yes we all do sometimes | How did yours smell like? My kitty smelled like freshly washed soap and cotton | Given your user name, I suggest you keep it that way | Wait what? | I don‚Äôt consider that stalking. If they didn‚Äôt want it public information why did they post it public information? You see what zi mean? | Or stalk someone‚Äôs socials of whom you previously went to school with but never ever spoken too üòÖ | Rare people go to that extend, that they start stalking in real life.‚Äô | I kinda agree üôà | So real üò≠ | Same, but I have anosmia. Fart away my friends! | GEORGE IS GETTING UPSET | Extra martial affairs are all the same in my opinion. Damage done is damage done.

Both my parents have been married 3 times‚Ä¶ for reasons. lol | Whut? People can fall in love at any point and any time. That's perfectly normal. Other people don't stop being hot or attractive just because you have a partner.   
Cheating is doing something with other people that exceeds the established boundaries of your relationship. You can't stop falling in love. You can choose to act on it or not of course. | i guess but no i know admits it | I feel these days it's more common to talk about it. When I was a teenager no one would ever admit to doing it | Never once in your life you've thought things wouldn't be better if you weren't around? | 100% haha. as the quote goes, ""embrace the hard times, they make good times into great times""

i don't believe that anybody above the age of 15 has not had a hard enough time that they think about dying. i don't know how you could enjoy the highs without the lowest of lows. all that shit i went through alone makes me stronger and makes the good times, great times. | I think everyone does. Everyone has that week in the year where all they think about is zipping a 45 through their skull. Life sucks for everyone eventually and it is what we make of it. | I disagree. I strongly believe everyone has had at least one point in their life where they thought life would be easier if they weren't alive. Yes, those thoughts are not ""normal"" but i truly believe everyone has them a few times. | Bro | But you are certainly someone‚Äôs enemy, whether you like it or not. | Don't think that's a realistic depiction of everyone though that thought has never crossed my mind and it's in sprt by controversial for a reason | I'm not understanding why anyone would think anything about it at all. | Whenever anyone asks me questions like that I always say ""kinda"" | U are my spirit animal | do you live in a 17th floor apartment too? | This is my favorite part of this whole thread, ha ha | use your fingers bro... | I do not care. | Then why are people mad at me for living my fantasies online, I am not in a relationship anymore. You sound stupid. | Maybe I‚Äôm a bit of an optimist haha. Normally I‚Äôve got my own stuff to worry about so I take them for their word.
I‚Äôve definitely learned to be a little more watchful over the years haha. | Showing someone how to do something in a trade could take days or weeks. That's the point of hiring people with experience, training people is super expensive | I‚Äôm in training. People should look into the 5 step teaching model | Yeah. My boss will ask me to do something, show me how he wants it done, and then watch me do the next one. If there's an issue, he will say it and tell me what to do differently. After that, he disappears to do his job elsewhere. | Personally, I hate micromanaging so if someone says they can do it, I take their word for it to avoid being the micromanager üòÇ 
A blessing and a curse, I suppose. | I‚Äôve got a good friend who really struggles with mental health.¬†

When he has really bad days, we just chill at a restaurant. Get something to eat, hang out, shoot the shit (usually about 70s/80s rock and metal music, we‚Äôre both big fans), and just vibe.¬†

Sometimes we talk about what‚Äôs bothering him, sometimes not.¬†

And he‚Äôs done the same for me when I‚Äôve had rough days and a couple rough breakups.¬†

So. Yeah, sometimes just being there for your friend is all you need to do.¬† | This is how I feel. I believe that most of the people I think about, never think of me. They cared less about me than I did them at the time, not saying that in a bad way but I'm being realistic...I feel like that's why they still come to mind. Unresolved on my end. People remember different moments they may shared together, while not remembering the respective others. | üò¢ü•π | Best part is when you hear a joke you've never heard before. | That'll hold up in court | Give her a break. The brain was itchy | Ah  shit ain't no recovering from that | And if you choose to not get surgery, you still have made a choice 

-Rush. | Johnny? Is that you? | I have no idea what any of this means | Doctors *hate* this one trick! | You have to say ""please"" | ü§£ cold turkey. I hope you got through the withdrawals, proud of you fren. | Nurses agree | I don‚Äôt remember reading that‚Ä¶ | The life support machine called... | Oh is that so?! Just so you know, I had sex with your mom! | Pff, I had sex with my wife too! | No? I mean i used to think if real scenarios with my bullies and think if comebacks to those but never made one up.


If im making shit up in my head im going on a god damn fantasy adventure why the hell would I spend that time thinking of miserable situations where i end up saying something clever | Who'd you hear it from? Yourself? | i sing when stressed. Not loud, just under my breath. | same | Sometimes I get so invested in my made up conversations and situations about people that my brain starts to brew real emotions towards that person. Then I‚Äôve to fight myself and tell it THIS IS NOT REAL DONT HATE THAT GUY | some of the world‚Äôs epic stories have been cooked between this wonder ‚Äúme myself and I‚Äù trio üî• | I don't really know what the normal way of thinking is like but I literally never internally verbalise any thoughts if they're just to myself. Like I can read these words in my head, I can remember or even imagine conversations with other people if I want to. But none of my reasoning is done verbally. I guess maybe daydreaming is a similar thing? Just slight visuals and vibes.


I think some people have a completely inability to make voices in their head but I'm not one of them.¬† | Weirdly enough, my dad has them... they're from his young and rambunctious years, but he isn't ashamed of them either...
I honestly never thought of it this way, but it's a good point that this isn't 'normal' for most people... 
Weird how these things are kind of similar, yet I never thought to connect the two, bc one was 'normal' to me growing up and one 'wasnt'... weird how that psychology works | The Todd appreciates hotness no matter the gender | Fucking hell this got me | Nobody would buy my cheese. | ‚ÄúAh someone must‚Äôve cut the cheese in this aisle‚Äù | Hahahaha | My buddy and I were at a supermarket once and entered an aisle and were hit with the stench of poop. We both looked around for poop only to see two girls at the end of the aisle scampering away and giggling as one of them was fanning her ass. The fart was both impressive and disgusting. | Savage | Oh man I laughed so hard at this | Did her hair move? | There‚Äôs somethin about big lots. Last time I was in big lots my farts were basically accelerating my cart. | It wasn't a real fart! I was just making a pretend fart noise! | I don't fart.... unless I am on a toilet, or asleep. Nothing to do with the fact that I am a girl, though. Everything to do with an unfortunate sharting situation when I was young that apparently led to me training myself to never fart unless I was on a toilet (thank goodness I can fart when asleep, tho - I wake up often enough just to pee, so glad I don't have to wake up to fart, too!) It is nice to know I won't accidentally embarrass myself when out and about, but extremely annoying when at home and having to stop whatever to sit on the toilet just to let a tiny toot out. :-| | Ive learned how to silence my farts on demand and I fart A LOT because I have a digestive disorder | Must've been you or sth | Now go away or I shall taunt you a second time! | Sometimes we can't help it | Are you doing it now? 

We will never know the truth.. | Let‚Äôs not forget Steve Martin in The Jerk. | Spelling checks out | Source: 

‚Ä¶. | Haha! She and I are verrrry open about sex, and get intimate basically every day. She has a very low libido, so never really masturbated much anyway, and since we have sex everyday, she hasn‚Äôt in ages (unless I ask her to so I can watch).

Me on the other hand üôÑ | I think they were implying that they just straight murder people if they get a little annoyed.¬† | Urine and semen are sterile but there are microorganisms in your urethra. Without them pathogenic ones would have an easier time to live there | finally some motivation to drink more water hrhr | Found Amber Heard | Showers can get hair clogs and then you're pulling out piss soaked hair | Just admit that you like shitting and pissing all over yourself and move on | It's not shaming it's just disgust because personally, it's a disgusting idea for them. You can keep shower pissing in freedom they just expressed how they feel about it | I wonder if you people clean your bathtubs and showers since ‚Äúit washes away instantly.‚Äù | So true fish piss and shit in water  and some things even eat shit then shit it back out. Some little kids pee in pools and some adults fuck in hot tubs. So beware of water , not only can you dround in it you can get shit, passed and even cummed on | I don‚Äôt pee in the shower and tbh I don‚Äôt care if anyone else does.

But surely people get that it‚Äôs rude to pee in a pool where people are literally swimming in it. | Yes also, what kind of balls.. matzo balls, meaty balls? Scale 1 to 10, how musky and such things | my personal fingertip sniffer will tell me. | Vinegar | Haha! Nice one. | I was just asking a question. I don't have any skin in this game, don't care what y'all do. People commonly refer to looking obsessively at someone's socials as stalking and was curious if that's what this commenter meant.¬† | Yeah, I agree with you on that...they all suck no matter the type of affair it is. | Maybe once or twice in my entire life of over 40 years. Definitely nowhere near once or twice per year. And definitely not what I would describe as ""extreme suicidal thoughts"". To me, that sounds quite worrysome, and it might be a good idea to talk to someone about it (i.e. therapist). Even if you don't actually fear for your life, I'm thinking that it must be quite anxiety-inducing to have such thoughts, and it might feel good to analyze why you're having them. | nah I've never done that, most people aren't suicidal | Now i want to do a survey with the people who i think don't think that and hope they answer truthfully
Edit: typo | Be real dude, you‚Äôre a liar or a saint | It‚Äôs an addiction if you are living your porn fantasies online and thinking it‚Äôs okay to relay those details to others. I‚Äôd be mad at you too if that‚Äôs what you talk about regularly.

Keep going, you‚Äôre doing great filling out your incel card! | Good lesson I learned was once giving direction, as them to repeat back what I asked, or if that comes across condescending, I ask them ""so what are you going to do first"" or ""so what's your plan of attack"" and they'll either have an idea, stare blankly, or ask follow up's at that point. | They really should be paying you to train. | In a normal task for someone with experience, 100%. The difference here is they say the issue arises when training someone. | ""used"" mud | Your honor, you can clearly see that my client couldn't see her speedometer.  She's clearly a full knuckle in and trying to dig out a snot rocket.  Her had is blocking the speedometer from her view. | Okay, so you read that as sister-in-law. I read it as son-in-law. Huh. | There are those who feel that they‚Äôve been dealt a losing nose. | Lol | Talked a lot of shit and got smacked for it. | please | So that when it inevitably happens,  you have a good comeback ready to go, it's not fantasy, it's preparation. | Slayer? | Didnt think about it that way. The joke was girls who show their nipple piercings are kinda slutty. I don‚Äôt see woman showing their belly button pierced or not as slutty. For me its actually kinda normal. Im heavily tattoed and so is my wife who has both nipples, belly button, tongue and nose pierced lol. Its just the thing youre used to be around i guess. | Wash more often. And yes people would unfortunately | The gas not passed is expelled out your mouth. | maybe I forgot I fell asleep it was history | Which hand tho | do i want to know what that is? | Amber Turd | You are weird mate | oh for sure it‚Äôs rude, but if you‚Äôve been in one before the age of 9 you‚Äôve probably done it. | Smell the glove | yeah starting to think i missed the mark on this one... glad to hear you can handle the ups and downs of life in a better, healthier way man üôè | Really? maybe not once a year, but not once? Never once you thought about if things would be easier if you just weren't? this is very interesting to me | Or im neither and im just not weird

But i will probably get impulsive thoughts about it now that it's a thing that i know people have, so thanks for that reddit | I understand the difference between fantasy and reality. You think I get boner and I want to hump things in not true, I am not aroused, you are not turning me in so I am not responding because if that.

I engage in a safe manner with other adults, the issue is that I am not into it like you think I am, never have been since I started these fantasies before I was self aware.

Yes you think it is an addiction, I understand and clearly disagree.

If women want sex with me, they can approach me, other than that I can handle my urges like an adult. | This was pretty much what I did when I was an Air Force MTI back in the day, which is the Air Force equivalent of a basic training drill instructor in other military branches. When training new MTI's, I would ask them to walk me through the plan for the day and let them fail on their own if that plan fell through. It was better for them to experiment with me there instead of when they were on their own as I could stop them if I saw things going south. I was there as the safety net. I can show you how to do the job all day long, but you need to develop your muscle memory and battle rhythm on your own. You can't get that from me just showing you and as the trainer, I'm really only with you for about 7 weeks and then the training wheels come off and you're now on your own. | Yes !  and on top of this the it‚Äôs always better to train someone by making them do it, no showing them. So they do the physical work but you‚Äôre guiding them step by step. A lot of people don‚Äôt learn by just watching or being told. | I'll just keep fucking with them if they jack something up after showing them how to do it. This seems to be the best way to do it because then they remember better if someone is messing with them vs trying to be a hard ass. It also teaches them that work doesn't have to be this extremely serious daunting task that sucks.



Some people don't like joking around in that case I'll approach it differently. | Didn‚Äôt think about that, but it was sister-‚Ä¶ | Nah it feels like it would be exhausting to put that much thought into what i might say if someone might say something | The Band? | The opposite of your username | Thank you! And I hope that you'll learn to handle it in a healthier way as well! | No. This behavior is not normal but it is not rare either. You should seek out therapy if you're feeling like this | okay if you're talking about once then yeah as a passing thought when I was in my angsty edgy years. But certainly not once or twice a year and certainly not a regular thing. | Hey my friend, I cannot say that I have not had similar feelings at some point, but yeah, that's not normal. Maybe see if you can find someone to talk to about it. Take care mate! | lol ‚Äúself aware‚Äù.
Okay. Have a good day. | What other Slayer would someone be singing? | Unlikeable animal | i'll be alright. getting to that point in life where i realize the bad times end up making good times into grest times. thank you for caring, have a good week | i'm alright, thanks for caring though :) | fair enough, good to hear you can handle the tough parts of life better now | thanks"
At what point in the wedding did you think the bride and groom would not be husband and wife for long?,"The bride invited her coke dealer to the wedding. Groom didn't know him, and didn't know she had such a big problem. | When the bride‚Äôs ‚Äôwork friend‚Äô was having a slow dance with her at the reception and feeling her arse up in front of the groom, family and friends. 

She left the groom the day they got back from their honeymoon. And she kept all the presents! | She was clearly in love with him. 
He was very clearly gay. 
Neither seemed to want to recognize it but EVERYONE ELSE WAS SURE OF IT. 
A few years later? Turns out he‚Äôs gay and wants a divorce. | I was a plus 1 at a wedding last year. By the evening bride was soooo drunk and she asked me to help her pee in her dress. I didn‚Äôt know her but being a gals gal I assisted. I made small talk whilst she peed and asked if she was having fun etc. 

She went into a weird trance and said: When I walked down the aisle, I was really disappointed that the groomsman I shagged a month ago didn‚Äôt turned up.

I don‚Äôt think she realised she said it out loud. Anyway‚Ä¶the marriage lasted 9 months. | Had a neighbor who got arrested teh night before his wedding in a bar fight. Then, the night of the wedding, walking back to the hotel with his new wife, decided he really needed pizza, so he tried to walk into a local pizza place.  It was closed, so he kicked in the door and kept walking. Got arrested 2 blocks down the street. So she spent the night before, and the night of her wedding alone and crying.  When they told me this story they were in the process of trying to get pregnant and have since had a kid. They got divorced very recently to absolutely NO ONES surprise. | When the bride specifically said she did not want to feed each other cake and he aggressively came at her with cake and shoved it in her face hard enough that it was in her hair and ruined her makeup while laughing about it. It also came out later that his groomsmen ate her special gluten-free lunch while setting up for the ceremony and he didn't say anything about it. 

It was less than a year. | It was her third wedding. Same place and same car .... as the first two times. Even though the groom was new! | When the groom shoved wedding cake into his new bride's mouth so hard that it chipped a tooth, bloodied her lip and blood staining her wedding gown. He kept pushing until she tripped over a tree root and fell backwards breaking her wrist. The groom's own father then began to beat the hell out of him.

Good times. | After the wedding her mom got them a room at the local motel for their honeymoon, but they came home because they got bored. | When the groom was passionately slow dancing with the best man.  The bride was crying, by herself, with no-one comforting her, sitting on a folding chair.

That seemed less than a match made in heaven. | My husbands side of the family is a goldmine for wedding drama.


One guy married at super young, basically because he got his girlfriend pregnant and it was very obvious that his inlaws were forcing the marriage.


One guy married a foreign girl he met at a study abroad program in Russia at the courthouse, no fancy dinner no nothing to celebrate, and had no idea how she could be so heartless to divorce him after she got citizenship.¬†


One guy made out with another woman on the dancefloor during the later part of the reception.


The only wedding I've been to that had to be stopped mid service by the ""speak now or forever hold your peace"" clause was when the brides estranged father stood up, who had not walked her down the aisle because he was not much a part of her life, and stated "" Father ""pastor"" I'm real sorry about doing this now but I just recognized where I think I've seen ""grooms"" mama before...and I'm real sorry ""father of the groom"" cause it seems ya didn't know, but I think you might be my son, so if I were you I'd get some bloodwork before going on with this here marriage.""


Turns out the man was right, they were half siblings and didn't know it. Called the wedding off, stopped the romantic relationship and are now happily married to other people but still hang out and invite each others families to family get togethers. | My male cousin.  Beautiful wedding at a Napa vineyard.  About 300 people.   During the reception the brides father came out dressed in a chicken suit.  Went around the reception just making a spectacle of it.  Everyone on our side of the family got a weird vibe, like he was mocking it, not that it was all in good fun.  The bride was just laughing it up like ‚Äòdad is so much fun isn‚Äôt he‚Äô

A couple months later, she posts some bullshit about ‚Äò no one will ever live up to my father, I can‚Äôt stay in this marriage‚Äô.  My cousin is a good dude. | The groom immediately downed a full GLASS of vodka as soon as they did the entrance. He was staggering, stumbling, weeping the whole time, and she basically had her reception alone. This was September. By Halloween he was gone living in another state with a woman he met 2 WEEKS before the wedding. They had been together for 7 years. This week would have been their 27th wedding anniversary. He did come back for his belongings a few months later and told her he got so drunk out of guilt and he was too scared to call the wedding (that she paid for) off. I remember it so well because it was the first wedding I ever attended and the ceremony was just beautiful and we (her coworkers) were all in tears about how we all wanted this for ourselves. Then the reception happened and we were all like um no thanks. She was never the same after that. | At the rehearsal, the groom's stepmother told the bride-to-be that he was a loser who would never amount to anything, then gave the best man‚Äîthe groom's older brother‚Äîmoney to buy the groom a lap dance and hooker, but the best man/brother went to the bride's hotel room that night and tried to make out with her.

I really didn't think it would last at that point, but we've been married 23 years now, so it turned out okay. | When my ex best friend was bragging while we were getting ready for the ceremony about sleeping with other men. She said they had an ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù when I asked if he specifically knew about it. She said ‚Äúhe doesn‚Äôt need to know‚Äù 

I‚Äôm all for people having whatever type of relationship they want. But dont make me complicit in your cheating. | At the reception the bride sat in a chair and cried because no one could get her any cocaine. They were divorced a year later. | Bride and groom had been together for years and she was hopelessly in love with him and he treated her like dirt.  This went on for years with her begging him to get married.  Finally, one day, he proposed.  I think he said something romantic like ""If it'll shut you up, let's get married.""

I was friends with a girl who was friends with the bride and went as her plus one to the wedding, which was held on Superbowl Sunday.  Early into the reception, the groom and his groomsmen left the party to go to a bar to watch the game.  His parting words to the bride were ""You know I love you, baby, but I've got 10 bucks on the game.""

They lasted nearly a year before she got tired of him cheating on her and she finally left him. | I was at the wedding of a couple who I worked with at a restaurant years prior. At one point during the reception, I‚Äôm doing shots with the bride and I tell her how much fun I‚Äôm having and that she looks beautiful in her dress. She then whispers in my ear to meet her in the bridal suite in fifteen minutes. They didn‚Äôt last longer than a year. | The groom and his groomsmen did a coordinated ""time warp"" dance from Rocky Horror Picture Show in the middle of the wedding, and the bride sat there stonefaced the entire time, obviously unamused.

Ultimately they were just two very different people. Marriage lasted about a year. | Good friend of mine works his arse off for his SO. They just got married this past summer. He works a hard blue collar job for $22/hr and she barely works part time. She demanded their wedding be the fanciest party ever thrown. Their wedding had a private band, beautiful venue, over the top food, and in the end the whole thing cost over $70k. My friend was crushed by this huge financial burden but just asked that they did a small honeymoon together. She refused to take any time to even do that. She really just wanted to show off her ‚Äúfancy wedding‚Äù and clearly didn‚Äôt care about the marriage. They just filed for divorce. | When the groom pulled out his phone and started watching UFC at the reception instead of dancing with his wife.

Spoiler: I was the wife. We didn‚Äôt  last lol. | [deleted] | When they announced they were engaged yet had active restraining orders against each other. | The statue of the woman on the cake was a completely different woman, actually his ex! So while she has long straight black hair and blue eyes, the lady on the cake had a short red fringe and brown eyes | My cousin and his wife got into a big fight the day of the wedding (he was already a little toasty and she was pissed) - it was so bad/obvious that people were talking in their speeches about how they were both just ""passionate"" and ""stubborn"" people but they loved each other deep down.

They lasted 7.5 years, which was about 5 years longer than most of us expected. Of course, they had a kid together, and I think that was part of why it lasted so long. | When I walked into the cocktail hour reception, said hello to an old friend from college, and he said ‚ÄúSo I was thinking about writing out the check I brought as a gift right to their divorce attorney‚Äù and I laughed and said ‚ÄúI asked my wife if we really had to bring a gift because we both know this marriage won‚Äôt last‚Äù. Still trying to figure out how everyone except the bride and groom knew their marriage was a bad idea. | At the wedding, everyone, even the parents, bet how long the married life will be. The marriage was only 24 hours long! Everyone argued about it and no one won. | I knew a wedding photographer. His litmus test for whether the marriage would work or not was how the couple handled feeding cake to each other during the reception. With something like an 80% accuracy, if they both shoved cake in each other‚Äôs faces and got mad they didn‚Äôt last long. If they both shoved cake in each other‚Äôs faces and laughed about it they were typically okay. If they both respectfully fed each other the cake they were usually good for a long time. | It was actually before they married, when they explained that they were getting married, ""To get the first one over.""

Yeah.  It didn't last. | When the groom, and father of the bride got into a fist fight at the rehearsal dinner. Groom drops the father with a clean right hand. Brother of the bride steps in to defend dad. Him and the groom go at for 2-3 minutes. Grooms father gets involved. Half the wedding party had black eyes and fat lips for the ceremony. 

The couple was divorced less then 6 months later | When he was being very serious with his vows and she wouldn't stop laughing. There were a lot of red flags in that relationship.

Oh, the he was me. | When his dad was taking bets on how long the marriage would last with us (the groomsmen). He won the bet at 9-12 months‚Ä¶.

She was bipolar and decided to stop taking her meds without telling anyone. She attached him in his sleep with a baseball bat because he was congested and snoring. She thought he was a monster. She broke his arm and 4 of his ribs. 

Two weeks after this incident she smacked his hand with a meat hammer while they were making dinner to ‚Äúwhat would happen.‚Äù 

She refused to take her meds and he left. 

She now has 7 children with 4 different guys. She is ridiculously hot still to this day so guys fall for her crap and then bail when they find out how fucking crazy she is. | I knew it wouldn't work out when the bride made out with my husband on her wedding day in retaliation because I was unable to help with her wedding dress while I was cooking for her wedding reception. She had her mom and aunt with her to help her. She and my brother broke up a few months later and I also don't have that husband anymore. | True story: I am the sister of the bride that day. My sister and groom ( her ex husband ), were in the venue after the church ceremony and at some point I noticed that he is not there. I saw my sister looking for him and asked me to look with her. We checked everywhere and I remembered that we didnt check the parking. I was thinking that maybe he is in the car looking for something. SURPRISE, surprise, he was fucking our cousin in the car. Car was literally shaking and we knocked on the car window and my sister screamed, threw the ring at him and slapped our cousin in the face and ran away. From that day which was 2 years ago, she still didint come to visit me or our family, and also our cousin went to live abroad with my sisters ex husband. So yeah, I would say if you are getting married and notice that the bride or groom are nowhere to be found, they are probably doing something wrong and save your life from misery and go take a look | When the officiant asked if anyone had any objections and the best man cleared his throat. It was all laughs until the bride joined in and said, ‚ÄòYeah, me too.‚Äô Awkward silence followed. Safe to say, they didn‚Äôt last long. | Was recently out in Vegas and the wife comes back from the bathroom having overheard the following conversation:

Woman 1: ""Tomorrow when they say if anyone has any objections you have to stand up and say yes.""  
Woman 2: "" why dont you just call it off""  
Woman 1: ""Because everyone is here and I dont want them to blame me""

I'm sure everything's fine.... | I was the best man for my friend, at his wedding I asked his then wife what it was like to be married, she said ""it still feels like at anytime I can leave if I want""..lol they were married for 6 years, longer than I thought they would make it?? | When the groom stood with his back turned toward my sister in law during all but the last 10 feet of her coming down the aisle, after his brother tapped his shoulder and told him to turn around. 

About 9 months after they were married he just came home from work one random day and told her he wanted a divorce (I believe it actually turned out to be an annulment) because he had been with someone else the whole time and he was done with my SIL. | We were friends of the groom‚Äôs father. The father told us he‚Äôd like to introduce us to his son‚Äôs first wife.

And sure enough, they returned early from their honeymoon, and divorced 2 weeks later. | These comments made me realize I have an amazing relationship with my wife. | When I saw the bride walking down the aisle with perfect makeup, a huge bouquet, elegant hair, an elaborate white ballgown, and the fakest smile I'd ever seen in my life plastered across her face. Smiles don't lie.  Marriage lasted under 2 years. | When the bride to be was bragging to everyone how 3 of her male 'friends' declined the wedding invite because they couldn't watch her marrying someone else.. Marriage lasted less than a year and apparently she was having virtual affairs with all 3 of them | Arrived at the venue to see a sign announcing ""Welcome to [Bride]'s Wedding"" and in smaller text underneath ""featuring [groom]"" they did a ring warming thing where the rings were passed around before the ceremony for everyone to make a silent wish/intention for the couple - I closed my eyes and thought ""May your divorce be relatively painless."" | When the vows said something about how my friend ""makes her a nicer person"" and how ""she makes him more assertive"" or something.¬†


It's been rocky for a while for them and I wouldn't have stayed through so much turmoil. Now I think they are staying together cause it's comfortable and it would just be hard to start over. I feel for him a little, but he's a grown adult who made the decision in his 30's. | At the hour and a half mark of the wedding. The wedding was two and a half hours total. They included *everything*. Unity sand, unity candles, poetry, songs, exchanging vows, rope on hands. I don't think they left anything out. They also spent an absolute fortune on the wedding. Something in me just knew it wouldn't last.

She ended up cheating on him (he was a really great guy) and pretended to leave the guy and go to couples counseling for a year before calling it quits. Her family all knew about the affair and no one told him. She lost her job because she worked at a Christian school that wouldn't support her cheating when it all came out. She's still with the guy and married him. I have no faith that relationship will last either. | Throughout the wedding the groom looked disinterested. The pastor mentioned how the wife should submit and her reaction didnt go over well with the grooms family.¬†


Also went to one where the pastor was bringing up issues the couple discussed in marriage counseling.¬†


If you arent on the same page with your husband or wife on how to run the family, please dont get married.¬† | when the bride and groom were arguing during the reception like full on snapping at each other in front of everyone it was pretty awkward and made me think they werent really on the same page even on their big day | Does the reception count? 

The girl has dated my brother on and off for years. She cheated on him with a lot of guys including the guy she was marrying who broke into their place and smashed a bunch of his stuff once. 

At the reception he hit the booze hard. We all did. She came over and I said I always thought she was going to be my sister in law. She said she thought so too, but no one stopped the wedding. Then my friend Philip who was shit faced accidentally bumped into a child and the dad punched him. He confusingly got into his jeep and drove off. The bride, who had a fling with him once started crying her head off. That's when her new mother in law came over and said that her new husband was vomiting in the bathroom and that she needed to take care of it because that's her job now. 

The cake was good. 

I met her outside of a Walmart a few years later and she was pregnant. I asked her about the guy and she said she had gotten divorced and remarried and was thinking about getting divorced again. |   
when the groom was no where to be seen during the reception. He was outside with his friends getting high. the bride (my friend) was sitting bored with us (family, and playing with the nephews) really shouldn't have gotten so far as the wedding day either (did last 2 years though) | When the bride told me they weren't going on a honeymoon because he was still paying off his last honeymoon. | I realized they were far more excited about the trappings of the wedding/party than each other. The only time the groom smiled was when he saw the car and how we‚Äôd followed the family tradition of decorating it. The marriage lasted 8 months. | During the groom's father's speech: ""...I hope this one sticks"". | The groom was doing heroin in the parking lot during the reception with the best man. 

A few years later he kidnappped and beat her and he ended up in jail (this wasn't the only reason he went to jail) so she divorced him. 

When he got out 8 years later they started seeing each other again and were married for the second time a year later. 

They're currently working on their second divorce. | Ran into one of the bride's new in-laws in the bathroom during the reception, and the in-law looked meth'd up. Had to wonder if she knew what she was marrying into. 

Father of the bride drove me back to the train station the following day,  and he expressed some misgivings about his daughter's choice of mate, but was trying his best to be supportive. 

We girls were 19 and 20 at the time, and I only had ever seen my overbearing parents freak out over my choice of boyfriends. Seeing a *normal* family expressing those kinds of concerns was an eye-opener for me,  like this is what real worry looks like. 

They lasted 2 years, I think. | Not me, but my cousin attended a wedding where the groom (a white guy) called the food at the reception stinky (bride was Pakistani)



They separated within a year lol | When my brother‚Äôs new wife turned away from him rather than kiss him at the appropriate time at the altar. | When the bride smashed cake in the grooms face and in response he spit on her. | The groom took the wedding cake thing a bit too far. The bride gave him a bite, but he kind of mashed it on her chin or nose, you know? Then he took a big piece and mashed it into her face so hard, I was thinking she was going to have a bloody nose for sure. Cake and icing were all over her face, in her eyes, down her front, you name it. The bride ended up having to clean herself up, get her makeup redone, and she was crying her eyes out about an hour after she said ""I do"". The groom didn't care at all.they drifted apart after a while. | When my wife told me that the groom didn't know the brides large house mortgage was being paid by the married guy she got pregnant by years earlier, and that gravy train had just stopped. 

So the groom didn't know he was living in a house that wasn't paid off like he thought, and next month there was going to be a mortgage payment they couldn't afford 

I realized I was standing at a wedding that was lies stacked on lies, and no way was it going to last.  It didn't | When my boyfriend at the time (and my plus one for the wedding) went missing for a couple hours at the reception, then broke up with me that same night, because he was in love with, and had been having an affair with the bride. The marriage did not last long (lasted longer than it should have though). | when they spent most of the reception apart barely talking to each other like you could feel the tension and it didnt seem like they were even enjoying the day together | When a guy who'd been at the stag do whispered to me that the groom got so drunk that he vomited black and kept saying ""I don't want this. I don't want this."" Over and over. | When the  bride's 16 year old niece gave a speech explaining that she met the groom through and app first and introduced her aunt to the groom but that she loved him.  Creepy as fuck. | I was best man in a wedding of a close friend 10 years ago. Leading up to the big day it became pretty clear for everyone that knew him it was a mistake. Him and I had a set schedule where we both had 1 weekend off together a month (think 24/7 factory schedules). The bachelor party at the last minute got moved like 2 weeks and he told me, ‚ÄúSteph said this was the best time for me to do it‚Äù. It essentially was so nobody could attend or put anything meaningful together. Wedding rehearsal became apparent that the brides main concern was doing what her best friend suggested and including her 11 year old son from a previous relationship. Wedding comes and bride and her whole family are basically treating the groomsman like we are butlers. Guys in tuxedo‚Äôs basically working like we were a chain gang in orange coveralls. Big Mormon family with about 8 brothers in jeans that couldn‚Äôt be fucked to set out a folding chair in the field the wedding was taking place. 

At the wedding reception the brides large family sat off by themselves and didn‚Äôt interact with anyone. At a certain point they stood up and basically started kicking people out saying it was time to clean. I along with everyone else on the grooms side had no idea about this. The bride basically didn‚Äôt say a word to anyone on the grooms side through the rehearsal all the way to the reception. When her family started ushering people out I was at the bar with the groom. Bride tossed me a broom and said ‚Äúthanks for coming, now start cleaning up‚Äù. I just laughed and went to collect my wife and another friend who was catching a ride with us. The other friend asked in the parking lot if we should feel bad about not staying to clean. I said nah, I‚Äôll stick around after the next one because there is no chance this is gonna last. I think it was about 16 months to the day that she changed the locks and had him served papers. She basically used him to be able to afford her white trash dream house they bought together. | Ooooh, my mom was a florist, and I've seen some doozies. She kept bragging about her ""2 karat, heart shaped pink diamond"" engagement ring, and how much it cost. I was chatting with the banquet hall manager while I was setting up their outrageously expensive reception, and when I went back later that night to pick up the rental equipment, she came running over to gleefully inform me that they got into a huge fight at the reception because his family was ""trashy"" and didn't give nice enough gifts. I hope he was able to get it annulled. 

We also had repeat customers. It was pretty common to do the flowers for multiple siblings, sister gets married, and loved the flowers at her brother's wedding, etc. But over the course of 10 years, we did flowers for one woman THREE TIMES. Technically, the third time was a ""commitment ceremony"" because the second divorce wasn't final yet. | Groom had sex with the bridesmaid between wedding and reception.    Hated the guy in highschool and it came as no surprise when I found out. | Somewhere between the forced smiles and the groom sweating like it was a hostage negotiation | ""Hmm.""

""What is it?""

""That mother in law looks beyond pissed right now.""

""Oh yeah... Why?""

""Something about the groom being a reformed drug dealer or something?"" | My cousins had a double wedding. 2 sisters marry 2 brothers. The older couple looked great. The younger sister was in tears. Not happy tears. Her groom wasn‚Äôt to happy either. 

I called it done before they hit the alter. They didn‚Äôt even make it through their honeymoon. | I started worrying when the bride and groom had a heated debate during the ceremony over whether the rings should go on the left or right hand. It was like the first test of marital harmony, and the groom's response was, ""Well, I thought it was the left hand!"" The whole room went silent, and you could almost hear the collective thought: ‚ÄúThis is going to be one for the books.‚Äù | Two moments:   
  
1. The wedding party were all staying in a big rental house for a couple days before the wedding. The night before, bride and groom were up super late partying and doing a bunch of coke. It's fine if that's your thing, I just kept thinking ""right before the most important day of your life?""

2. The next day (day of the wedding), the bridal party is all getting ready, doing hair and makeup, and the bride WAS WRITING HER VOWS. Like 1-2 hours before the wedding. She wrote something sooo generic and was like ""how about this?""

Marriage lasted 9 months. | I was at this wedding held in a basement of an Elks Lodge. It was a bit of a hillbilly affair, but a lot of fun. The bride wasn‚Äôt wearing underwear and kept flashing people her business, not on accident, but full on Tammy Swanson style with the snapping fingers and pointing at it. No one seemed to think it was odd, even her husband. I thought to myself there‚Äôs no way this works. It didn‚Äôt. They were divorced in months. | The groom wrote HELP ME on the bottom of his shoes in white marker so when he was kneeing at the alter during the church ceremony it was very visible to every one in the church. During the wedding reception it was obvious that he and his best man were the only two that thought it was funny. It gave the whole reception a kind of sad undertone feeling sad for the bride and wondering how long she would put up with her man-child husband. | When they were both 18 and it was a month after high school graduation. I was correct. | My wedding, actually during my wedding reception.  When I couldn't find my new husband because he and all his friends took off to local bars, leaving me (his brand new wife!) alone to say goodbye to all the remaining friends, family, guests.  

My brother-in-law got us a taxi (at the insistence of my heavily pregnant sister) and helped me track down my husband so I wouldn't be wandering the streets alone so late at night.  

I should have dumped him then...  took me 6 long years to free myself from him. | When the groom got way too drunk and admitted to his buddies he cheated on the bride while engaged‚Ä¶.at the wedding reception¬† | The bride and groom eloped right before attending the bride‚Äôs baby sister‚Äôs wedding. Only ONE of the bride‚Äôs 4 children was at the ceremony; the oldest stayed home with the two youngest because she disliked the groom. They lasted longer than anyone actually expected (7 years), but in the end they separated because he was arrested for SA. 

I was the bride‚Äôs oldest child. I knew the groom was trouble, but no one listens to children because they don‚Äôt know anything /s. | When he introduced his new wife to the chauffeur of their wedding day limo by accidently using his ex-wife's name . | [removed] | The night they had their jack and Jill, the bride made out with multiple dudes at the bar after the groom had gone to bed. The grooms family and friends saw it happen.

They still got married! What an awkward wedding that was | Anytime the groom smears/smashes cake on the bride. I've seen it happen at 3 different weddings and they all ended up divorced. | It was when i paused for such a long time before i said i do. I wanted to say i don't but didn't want to create a drama. I suspected he was still seeing the ex, but trying to be adult and think he is allowed whatever friends he chooses. I ignored a red red flag. After a year i had a field trip that was cut short, came back to him missing. When he did rock up, an hour before i was \*due\* back and asked him where he had been, he said he'd spent the weekend with her. I just calmly packed my shit in my car and left. | The bride was shit faced drunk and twerking and grinding on other men at the reception in front of everyone | I was a groomsman.  During the wedding when the officiant asked if anyone objects the entire wedding party minus the bride and groom turned  to the audience expecting someone to say something.  Was the funniest moment I‚Äôve seen at a wedding. That was in 2001 and they are actually still together. | When he smacked the shit out of her in front of everybody for putting cake on his nose. That video was crazy | The groom pulled out a shotgun in a depressive alcohol stupor during one of the pre-wedding parties, and the bride cried during her bachelorette and insisted we showed up to the strip club the guys were concurrently at, and we did. I had a lot of fun that night, the couple did not.

We were 19 years old. Lasted about a year.¬† | My cousins wedding. She left her husband who she had two kids with because he had grown content, was controlling of what they ate (they werent allowed to do a weekly shop, hed pick up the ingridents for the nights meal on his way back from work). He wouldn't let them have hot water on in his house. Basically everything he could to save money, which he did spend on them royally at Christmas, birthdays etc. Rest of the time though, all work, no play, no spending. 

Anyways she left him to be with the guy she was hooking up with. Then decided to get married to him. At the wedding all I kept thinking was this rebounds going to end in disaster. Especially given this guy is the opposite, over spends out of budget. 

But in his defence, hes awesome, he loves the kids like they are his own. He does everything with them, from learning how to do the girls hair to coaching the boy in fishing. He'd do anything for them or her. he worships all of them. They've been married now for over 12 years and still going super strong | My brother out in LA got engaged to a life support system for a pair of boobs. No, seriously, that's all I remember about her. She came to town for our family Christmas and barely ever left their bedroom. Spent the bare minimum of time with our family.

Fast forward to late June, two months before the Labor Day wedding. My brother calls me and says, ""She's moved out of the bedroom. What do I do?""

You'd have to know my brother. Mr. Confident at all time. Never asks advice of anyone. I said, ""You know, if you postpone this wedding, nobody in the world will think badly of you. It's okay if you just put things off until you're absolutely sure.""

Nope. The wedding took place on a beautiful bluff overlooking the beaches of Malibu. I realize that we're from Alabama and all, but we all have multiple degrees, dress well, speak proper English, and didn't arrive in a backfiring Ford F150 with a coon dog baying off the back. My wife, sister, and mother could all attend a State Department dinner and find fault with the place settings. So it's not like we were the fucking Clampetts pulling into town and tossing a line into the cement pond out back.

Yet her family, pretty much a bunch of ordinary middle-class folks from Seattle treated us like something out of the Grapes of Wrath. As in Joad, party of eight, your table is back by the kitchen.

And because my brother is in the movie biz, the Hollywood types were out in force, most of whom looked as if they had just rolled out of bed for an afternoon wedding. I remember being an usher and extending my arm to some B-level starlet, asking 'Bride or Groom?' 'Bride.' As I took her arm, her companion said, 'Oh, no man. She's my date.' The woman said, 'No, he's ushering. That's what they do.' Nevertheless, he took her own arm, making us a walking threesome as I walked them to their seat.

The bride comes out in what could only be described as stripperwear. I mean, I'm no prude, but Dear God she was hanging out everywhere possible. As in a preview of coming attractions.

There were only two highlights that evening. In the drink line, one guy finally decided to make conversation:

""So. You're from Alabama, right?""

""Yes.""

""Were you excited to get on a plane and come allllllll the way out here?""

""That was neat. But you know what's really cool?""

""What's that?""

""These are only the second pair of shoes I've ever owned.""

To the guy's credit, he realized he had stepped in it and we had a funny conversation after that. But then I was seated at the table next to someone from a very popular show at the time. You'd know this woman. But even though I was completely done with Hollywood people, I felt I needed to be cordial. So I tried to make conversation, only to be ignored by her while she scanned the room and looked for someone important to talk to. Finally, I decided to take the offensive.

""Excuse me. Don't I know you from somewhere?"" She shoots me this look like, 'Okay, another star-struck rube from the sticks. ""Weren't you in a movie ten years ago with Mark Harmon named Summer School?""

She blinked a couple of times and said, 'Yes, I was.'

""I thought you looked familiar. What are you doing now?""

She told me the name of her show, and I said, ""Oh, cool. I think my receptionist watches that. I'll tell her I met you."" And after that, we had a good conversation.

Back to my brother and the bitch she married. As we're all about to leave, I ask my brother about their honeymoon destination. He had kept it a big secret up to that point.

""Saint Maarten in the Caribbean.""

""But it's September. It's hurricane season.""

""Nah. They say the hurricanes never hit there.""

Three days later, I'm in a hotel room in Atlanta, knotting my tie in preparation for a business meeting while watching the Weather Channel report on a hurricane smacking into St. Maarten. They were marooned there for three weeks and had to be evacuated by the Dutch Marines. 

When they got back to LA, she packed her stuff and left. Good riddance, in my opinion. My brother did much better with the next woman he married. | groom got into fight with father-in-law. split up three days later.. | My long time crush / best friend was getting married. During the reception I told her new husband congratulations and he looked around the room and said, ""Thanks."" That was it.¬†


Also the groom's cake was a golf course, which was the cause of their first breakup as he would play golf on days they already made plans. He also cheated on her on a few cross country golf trips.¬†


Somehow that wasn't the final straw, even after someone tried to break into their apartment. She called and he said, ""I'll be there after I finish. You know where the gun is.""


Yeah I'm salty. That dude was a piece of shit.¬† | ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy to finally have a partner who LOVES and SUPPORTS me, instead of LYING and ABUSING me,‚Äù the bride said furiously during her toast, while the groom looked awkwardly at his plate. She spent another fifteen seconds indirectly shitting on her ex, but it felt like an eternity. 

For context, she had just divorced her previous husband, like, seven months earlier. Her family was religious, so they‚Äôd hustled to marry her off to the first okay guy that was interested in order to avoid the stigma, though she definitely made up for it by talking so much about her ex, her new husband was clearly and painfully a shallow rebound. I think they made it almost two years | I was talking to a friend days before her wedding, and I asked if she had gotten the marriage license yet. I thought to myself they could save some heartbreak and just not. I didn‚Äôt tell her though. Shows what I know. They took off for their 20th anniversary trip today | The bride fainted when she had to say her I do‚Äôs.
They lasted a few years, then she had an affair. After the affair ended she left him for her fathers best friend. She divorced him and went on to another guy. Now she lives with her cats. | When the Groom hit on me | Out of all the people I've known to get married by their mid 20s, I think only 2 are still together. So that's a big indication. 

The one I really remember included a big argument before the wedding that concluded with the groom dumping his drink over the wife's head. I'm surprised they didn't call it off then but it didn't last a year. | When the groom's kid from a previous relationship ran up the aisle during the vows and yelled, at the top of his lungs, ""I don't WANT him to marry her!""

But they were already getting marriage counseling before the wedding for his many infidelities, so there's that. | In the vows where she basically said she understood she was inferior and she would always submit to him (this was a religious belief)

2 years later she had a small child and was pregnant with another while he was living in their house with his new gf üò©ü§Æ | Within an hour of getting married the couple and I were talking about how pretty the lake was and how we never made the time to get up to visit it. They suggested we all go to the nude beach while they had time off for their honeymoon. Very hint hint, nudge nudge.

This was also the wedding that I'm still not sure if I was supposed to attend. They originally created an event listing and invited various friends & friendly acquaintances, including me. I put it on my calendar and never checked the guest list again. When I got there it was only family and incredibly awkward though the families were overboard nice to me. I'm thinking the site had a wedding organizer who set up the arch and chairs and when the couple found out more people cost more money they disinvited people without informing them. So, being half-assed about the entire planning may have been a bit of an indication too. | When the bride and groom showed up dressed as the Joker and Harley Quinn 6 months before the ceremony.

A year later I was telling her it was okay to divorce and none of us would judge her | They had their honeymoon at Disneyland. There were a lot of red flags looking back, like the fact that they were both 19, and the groom had just recently left a cult. But for some reason at the time the thing that stood out to 15 year old me as the most unencouraging was the Disneyland honeymoon. | When the bride gave her father in-law a lap dance. She legit made it a moment and pulled a chair to the center of the dance floor for everyone to watch. | When it was time to cut the cake, which had a little bear bride and a little bear groom on top, and the groom pulled out a samurai sword and lopped the head right off that little bear bride. 

He looked so proud of himself and she looked absolutely devastated. | 20 or so years ago, I went out drinking with some friends. They were d-bags who enjoyed fighting. Ran into a different group out *the night before their wedding* who also seemed like d-bags that liked to fight. Of course, there ended up being an altercation. Nobody got arrested or anything, but the groom-to-be got a broken nose and black eye, etc.

We all went our separate ways, but I always wondered how the next days wedding ended up. | When the groom was caught passionately kissing her twin sister at the reception. .. | When I went with them to pick out wedding invitations.

They got into a screaming match so intense that I almost stepped out of their car at a red light.

They are divorced now | The groom, my brother and I were having drinks at the bar. The groom spent 15 min talking shit about the brides family and how they come from ‚Äúwhite trash background‚Äù and how ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt civilize these animals‚Äù.
Divorce was finalized before their one year anniversary. | When the officiant (Friend of the bride) was flirting with the groom. They are now marrried. | At the wedding rehearsal, the father of the bride told the groom that his daughter wasn't worth the effort and he [the groom] could and should do better. 

Her father was right. | The wife looked bored and over it shortly after the ceremony. Alcohol livened her up a bit, but she still felt removed from the event. A few years later she cheated on the husband and they divorced. | I would have to say my own wedding. My MIL is a horrible person and had abused and controlled her family for so long. At the wedding, she caused a scene and a member of my family stepped in. It was super dramatic. My new husband only saw the part where my family member got involved (and I‚Äôll admit, wasn‚Äôt kind about it) and it was a lot of drama with his family storming out of the reception. I remember thinking ‚Äúwhat the hell have I done?‚Äù And thinking to myself that I simply wouldn‚Äôt submit the wedding certificate and we could just pretend the whole wedding never happened. 

It was an extremely rough time for us as I was defending my family member and he hadn't seen how his mom had behaved (which was deliberate on her part to manipulate) so he was very upset by how things went down.

I truly didn't think we would make it at that point. | When I caught the groom fucking the bride's father behind the dance hall. | When the groom and his buddies were talking about which girls were hot and which girls were ugly during the reception. | Her ex-husband was the best man.  She had divorced him 2 days prior. | When the bride called me two weeks before the wedding saying the groom had ""moved out"" of their house. 6 years later they're in the process of getting divorced.¬† | Anytime someone smooshes cake into their new spouse's face, the marriage is doomed. It is the kiss of death. This is after many decades of observation, and it never fails. | When I realised that the tears during my vows were not happy tears | when the groom kept checking me out, checking out my mom, kept asking questions about me while sitting next to his new wife üòê terrible feeling all around¬† | I was just pacing the pews in the church corridor, and I couldnt help it but I heard an exchanging of words between a bridesmaid and a waiter.  

Something About the wedding being beautiful and it was a shame about the groom's bride being a whore. 

Got pretty heated when I chimed in. | A relative got married to a woman he dated for about a year, which at his age, is not uncommon. When I met her she seemed to ‚Äúplay‚Äù nice, everything seemed superficial but I thought maybe I was just misreading her, maybe she was nervous and not being herself. Basically, I wrote it off. But when I got to the wedding venue I was greeted by a GIANT portrait of *JUST her* at the entrance to the venue.  I thought it was odd but maybe they were just playing into the fact that it was her special day. But each row of seating had a different photo of just her throughout her life. There was no representation of the husband. Silly me, I still thought ‚Äúmaybe that‚Äôs what they wanted‚Äù. To keep things short, the wedding was very much focused on HER and not them as a couple or him at all. In the back of my mind I was thinking ‚Äúthis seems off‚Äù but I tried to right those thoughts off. Fast forward several months, she unexpectedly filed for divorce. According to him, no big fight, no blow out, no indication there were even problems. She wanted everything.I truly believe she only married him for financial gain. After that, he pretty much decided he‚Äôs not open to relationships and hasn‚Äôt dated since (over a decade later) | When the bride came outside, stomped her foot and screamed at her new husband, full name (middle included) because he was having a beer with his groomsmen.  Everyone got real quiet and the groom's best man raised his bottle and said, ""Introducing Mr. and Mrs. _________!  May they live happily ever after!"". She told him to go fuck himself.  They lasted 2 years. | When some stuck up plastic bitch from a wealthy family married one of my college friends and in the receiving line after the ceremony I said ""Congratulations Mrs Smith"". (she took his last name). She made a face like I just farted and said "" Don't say that it hurts my ears! "" Less than two years later she cheated on him with a rich older guy and left him with no notice. Felt kinda bad for him but nobody but him was surprised. All of us hated her from the get go. Then she convinced her best friend who had married another of my friends to cheat on him. My wife always hated those two bitches from the minute they met, as did I. That was over 25years ago and my wife and I are still happily married. | I knew it wouldn‚Äôt last before the wedding even happened. Because they had already gotten legally married on paper several months beforehand, but were ‚Äútoo scared to tell their families.‚Äù So the huge, destination wedding at a resort hotel that they spent tens of thousands of dollars to put together was based on a lie. Call me crazy but it just didn‚Äôt seem like an auspicious start to a marriage.¬†

Sure enough, not two years later and they‚Äôre divorced.¬† | The grand march was about to happen.  The groom just sat there drinking with his friends like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big fucking deal and the rest of the wedding can wait for me while I‚Äôm drinking with my friends.‚Äù

Lasted 2 years. | [deleted] | The bride began telling everyone the groom's parents were stealing their wedding gift money. The poor groom tried to calm her down the entire night but she repeatedly ignored him or otherwise kept bringing it up. No idea where it came from; in our family culture it was bad luck for the bride and groom to be directly handed money and gifts on the wedding and the groom's family was sorting and storing gifts as expected. 

Culminated in her flat out confronting and accusing her new mother-in-law of theft at the venue at the end of the night-- in front of everyone. It wasn't true but nothing he or his parents said could change her from... Whatever she was thinking.

Obvious waving red flag, but it lasted way longer than it ought to have solely by virtue of how far the groom was willing to break his spine backwards for her and how far the family was willing to forgive for the groom's sake. | She had a port wine birthmark across her face and had spent hours getting her makeup just right. (I always thought she looked gorgeous either way.) But her husband grabbed a hunk of cake at the wedding and smooshed it all over her face, removing her makeup. She left the reception and didn‚Äôt return. | Usually it's the point where I hear how much they spent on the wedding. If they spend more than 6 months of their combined wages (like, not what's left after the bills are paid. The entirety of 6 months of wages) odds are it's not going to last.

The ones that have lasted the longest where the ones where both were ""Lets just make it official, right?"" then got a cheap wedding with just the bare minimum. | Brother in laws wedding. I‚Äôll preface this by saying thankfully they are still married and happy. But the maid of honors speech had me and my husband side eying the whole family HARD. My husbands family is a pretty well off and well known family in their small town. The maid of honor was the brides younger sister. She ended the speech by saying ‚Äúwe finally got a *insert grooms last name*‚Äù. Like, finally? How many did you try (family has three sons all around the same age) were you just targeting the family to get into it? Was super weird and everybody kinda just awkward laughed. | When I noticed the bruises on the bride‚Äôs legs and one of her arms.  I think she stuck it out 18 months. | The maid of honour started off her speech with: ‚Äú ( grooms name )‚Ä¶. You‚Äôre marrying ( grooms name )? Yikes! You could hear a pin drop in that venue. They didn‚Äôt see their 1st anniversary. | When I picked her up on the dance floor and dropped her! Good thing we were both feeling no pain. | The one where it was a picture perfect wedding and reception in every way ended in just a few years. The one where the bride and the grooms sister got into a fist fight in a moving vehicle while the grooms mother was driving is still going strong. The one where the general consensus was that ""he could do much better"" ended because she thought she could do much better. The one where the general consensus was ""this is a terrible mistake for both of them and will end badly"" is all good these days. | A few years back, I was in the bridal party at a wedding and it was crazy! During the rehearsal dinner, the bride's future in-laws were so rude to her. They were all over her, making her do stupid stuff and talking down to her like she was nothing. They wouldn't even let her hang out with the groom's friends until after the bride had left and they were drunk. | My buddy's first wife was an absolute nightmare.  And all of our friends knew.  From the beginning.  She told him that our friend cornered her and assaulted her.  So, their friendship was derailed.  Our friend has and extraordinary wife and kid.  Even his brothers didn't like her.  We tried to tell him not to do it.  When they got engaged, it was very much a fake ""Oh! good for you guys..."".  Wedding came,  she didn't have any friends to be bridesmaids.  He had 6 groomsmen.  Girlfriends of friends had to fill in to even out the wedding party/pictures.  Surprise surprise.  She got worse.  Divorced 10 months later.  She got his childhood home.  And was pregnant within a month or so.  Thankfully, my buddy found a good one.  And is happily married now with two kids. | When she leaned away from him during the kiss at the alter üò≥ | My friend at the time got pregnant then decided to marry this tool who happened to be my boss. Whispers at the wedding gave them until the baby was born before she left him. 

He was so verbally abusive and neglectful towards her throughout the relationship and leading up to the marriage. She changed into a neurotic and anxious person who would scream at him in front of their child when he would disappear for hours with no explanation. He would gray rock her and gaslight when confronted with the absurdity of being out until 10 at night without explanation, not answering his phone. I stopped myself from voicing my concerns 100s of times. Some of our other friends felt the same way. We got to the point of talking about an intervention but had cold feet in the end. 

He cheated on her a few times that I know of and basically threatened me when it got out at work. I lived for two years in total misery where my boss used my job as leverage to keep his secret. When I got close to quitting his behavior escalated to physical intimidation. He‚Äôd follow me around town, tell me if I told he‚Äôd ruin me professionally if I told her. I knew he could. By the time I quit I was so afraid he‚Äôd make me unemployable, I ghosted the friend and the rest of the group. I wish she never met him. She turned into an absolute waste of a person and I miss her every day. I hope their kid can form secure attachments with her future partners. Fuck you Kassidy. | Bride was 3 hrs late to the ceremony. All the speeches at the reception were about her being a run away bride and how she didn't want to get married. | Wife's cousin with a track record of real stupidity marries her male double, just as stupid not nearly as pretty.

Time to cut the cake and they are both totally hammered.  She does the typical take a piece of cake and smash a little playfully on his nose. 

I have no idea what he was thinking with this.  But he in turn, took a big handful of cake in one hand, grabbed her by the back of her head with the other, and full force smashed it and ground it into her face.

Then the fists started to fly.  Then the drinks.  She had to be removed from him and the reception ended there.  Divorced a few months later. | He got confused and blew out the unity candle | I'm speaking in hindsight of course, but there were worrying signs from the very beginning for me.  They didn't seem like a happy couple at all even when dating.  Most couples I see are happy to hang out with friends but I rarely ever see them around our social circles and she always looked unhappy.  Looking back now I almost wonder if he was trying to hide her or something or that she just hated being in social situations.  It was during covid times so I thought maybe that was why I never got to see them much or why he properly never introduced her to my friends and I.  Their wedding just felt lifeless, disorganized, and didn't even have many friends there is what really clued me in.

Long detailed version:

I went into their very cheap wedding (I can kind of understand due to finances) at his church full of volunteers who didn't do a very good job at all.  And honestly I don't think he compensated them either.  The wedding was also at 2pm for budget reasons meaning everyone eats chips and crackers only.  Already bad vibes.  However that wouldn't matter as long as the ceremony itself was full of joyous caring people.  But the wedding party was really just family and members of his church.  I knew the groom some but didn't know the bride very well at all.  Whenever I was around her, she was very unpleasant and always in a bad mood and she would never greet anyone which is very rude in my eyes.  She also had this ""leave me alone!"" sort of attitude all the time.  I often wondered what he saw in her as she always looked unhappy, even around him.  Funny thing is at the wedding is the only time I saw her smile, but I honestly wondered if it was genuine.

So like at any wedding, I'm hoping to see some happiness and their close friends supporting them and speaking positively about them and their relationship.  Problem was there was none of that.  I noticed her side of guests were just family and no real friends at all.  She didn't really interact with any of her side of guests.  99% of weddings I've been to the bride and groom are usually occupied by guests happily and excitingly talking to them most of the time.  I found the AV guy (who messed up all the wedding dance songs 3 times in a row) had the ceremony schedule and almost nothing was going as planned.  The wedding skipped over the best man speech, bridesmaid speech, cutting of the cake, toasting everyone at each table, group photos, etc.  I was really looking forward to the bridesmaid speech to hear something positive about the grouchy bride but never got to hear anything.  I left early because I got really bored and it felt so disorganized and I never leave weddings early, unless I don't directly know the bride/groom.  I found out later some others left early as well, while others were obligated to stay to clean up because church.

So 1 year later and they're divorced.  Honestly there's fault on both sides I hear.  But I really feel like the groom rushed into it and just didn't think long term about anything.  I think the bride just went with him because she was so unpleasant in general that she probably just liked the first bit of attention she as ever gotten from anyone.  I'm no longer friends with the groom because I've seen a pattern of negligence and ignorance in him and he's discreetly playing victim all the time and things just didn't add up when I heard other perspectives.  I also got fed up to how he never apologizes for anything when it's clearly his fault.  I wouldn't be surprised if some of that was part of the divorce too.  My friends have done the same.  Sad thing is he's done his before with a previous girlfriend and had to leave that friend circle and church but this time it's marriage and I don't think he's learned his lesson and will probably do it again if he's still a dick.  And before they got divorced I felt like if anything the bride would probably kill him over something irrational if anything because of how weird she was.  She gave me psycho vibes honestly.

Also I want to add that I occasionally film weddings but did not offer to film his because I had a weird feeling he didn't really care and would say ""Oh sure you can do that...""  The value he put into the wedding seemed really lacking and it really showed.  So glad I did not waste my time filming it.  It was an awful looking wedding too since it was so cheaply done and devoid of any joy. | My cousin was getting married to the father of her son. The save the dates went out about a year prior. This one was going to be a biggie. I got engaged after but was getting married a month prior to her. She, her mom, dad and kid came to visit family in my state.  I went by to visit and it was the first time seeing each other since getting engaged. 
She asked to see my engagement ring. I said let me see yours. Her mother said she lost it. ü§î. I‚Äôm saying to myself huh?  The later that night I remembered that her older sister also lost her engagement ring but they ended up not getting married. 
I said to myself then that this was not going to last. 
A year after a $30,000 wedding and another baby they were getting divorced. 
I didn‚Äôt find out until 2 years after that that the divorce was because he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúa good husband‚Äù. Another 2 years after that I find out that he had baby with the girl he was cheating with. 
For a timeline I got married in October. She got married in November. She had her baby the August after she got married. Side piece had her baby in January of the next year. 
And while he was doing all of that they were living with her parents. 
From what I understand he is now married to the side piece and have a good co-parenting relationship. | They were both very drunk from the night before, laughing during the ceremony, and not really paying attention. She was selfish and he was an ahole. Why they thought any of it was a good idea is beyond me. Somehow they lasted about 2 years and none of it looked good from the outside. | When, at the reception, the bride and bridesmaids socialized among themselves, and the groom and groomsmen did the same. Neither acknowledged the other‚Äôs family. Divorced within a year. | The groom was late to the ceremony because he had stormed off after getting in an argument with the best man, and one of them punched the other in the face‚Ä¶ they had to postpone the whole thing to find him‚Ä¶ 

Then the entire reception turned into a massive brawl. | Unfortunately it was the my own wedding‚Ä¶ 

About two hours before the ceremony my husband to be (now ex husband) texted me to say he didn‚Äôt write his vows. I quickly wrote  some that matched mine so it looked like we planned it, and emailed them to him telling him to ask the venue coordinator to print them for him. 

Well about 20 minutes prior he calls me from his best man‚Äôs phone and says he forgot to get them printed and he can‚Äôt find his phone, can‚Äôt I just hand write a copy for him???  Sure. Fine. I write a copy. 

During the ceremony he gets about halfway through his vows andstarts struggling‚Ä¶. pauses‚Ä¶. Then says ‚ÄúSorry, I can‚Äôt read *your* handwriting‚Äù  in front of every single one of our friends and family and then me having to help him read it‚Ä¶. 

The number of people who asked me afterwards ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt he read the vows beforehand?‚Äù ‚ÄúWas that the first time he saw them?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt he write his own?‚Äù 

It was the perfect picture of how inconsiderate and lazy he was, and how everything was my fault and my problem even if it was his responsibility. He didn‚Äôt care about me, or anything I cared about. He regularly put down things I was interested in just cause he wasn‚Äôt. Our marriage was crumbling by our first anniversary and we were living separately by our second.

I learned my lesson. My new husband is amazing. I actually had a moment I knew it would work instead of one I knew it wouldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶. We got married in a courthouse and a typo on my ID that I somehow failed to notice for months resulted in us having to run around on our wedding day to get it fixed. The way we tag teamed that and he was so supportive and nice that day‚Ä¶. I knew it would work out. Our six year anniversary is this year :) | At an extravagant, over the top Hollywood wedding, everyone at the table was discussing how long the marriage would last. Not a single person thought it would last longer than the last two marriages of each partner. | My brothers 4th wife: right from the start. | The age gap. She was 23 and he was 45. Both worked fastfood ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è SHE moved her previous 2 baby daddies in with her and her husband because that's not weird at all. They bought a house and then divorced not too soon after. Now she's back to selling cooter pics online | they started arguing during the vows.. | The reception was delayed because he was too drunk | They gave speeches at the reception and I don't recall them mentioning their new spouse more than once each. Pretty weird to have a day devoted to 'us' and only talk about 'me'. 

Of course my drunkenly pointing this out, much louder than I realized, got a lot of dirty looks. Turns out I was right even if I was an asshole, they were divorced two years later. | When the groom referred to the bride as his ‚Äúmost valuable acquisition‚Äù during his speech at the banquet. Then they spent most of the dinner sitting next to each other and talking to their respective bridal party members and ignoring each other. ¬†¬† | Bride was grinding on one of the groomsmen on the party bus after the wedding. Didn't even make it to the reception. It was so obvious that when I told my kids they were getting a divorce a few months later my 12 stepson just asked if she was cheating with the groomsman. | At the reception. I asked the groom for a photo of the two of them. He tapped his new wife on the shoulder to get her attention and she damn near bit his head off. They split up 6 months later. | When my cousin‚Äôs husband got pissed when he found out it was just going to be the two of them on their honeymoon and that he couldn‚Äôt invite a bunch of his buddies with. üôÑ | Groom forgot to handle some little detail that nobody would have noticed and the bride spent like 20 minutes screaming at him at the top of her lungs. Stupid and inept are some of the nicer words that came out of her mouth. It was bad enough that a few of us told him that if he wanted to bail on the whole thing, we'd take him out, get him drunk and make sure he had a place to go away from her. He went through with the wedding, but the marriage only lasted like 6 months | When my partner wouldn't dance with me... | The entire bachelor party got arrested like two days before the wedding for getting into a bar fight, my dad being one of them üòÖ 

This was a second marriage so they weren‚Äôt doing anything elaborate, and the bachelor party was just gonna be the groom (my dads bff) and his friends watching a football game while they ate and drank. 

They ended up getting into a HUGE bar fight, my dad knocked someone out by throwing a beer bottle at them, even the grooms elderly father participated and got arrested. 

This wasn‚Äôt a group of 20 year olds, this was a bunch of men in their late 30s. 

I remember my mom and the bride (they were bffs as well) panicking. They got everyone bailed out, but I was a kid and could have told you that was a bad omen. 

The wedding was awkward because there was visible tension between most of the wives/girlfriends of the groomsmen. 

They had a pretty nasty divorce a couple of years later. | Used to work weddings a lot and if the bride starts being too flirty with strangers you basically know it's dead on arrival. Usually that's the job of the bridesmaids. | When the bride was weeping during her vows and the groom was looking anywhere except at her with a bored look on his face. | It was wholly the bride's wedding, to the point where she essentially chose the best man and took away groomsmen speeches (saying that there wouldn't be time for everyone the groom wanted to speak) and gave her bridal party and father extra speeches. He got no say in anything at the wedding. 

She also didn't write her own vows, she quoted a poem (and didn't tell anyone that she didn't even write it). Didn't even add a personal touch at any point. 

It lasted 3 months, and she took all the gifts.

(I was the best man the groom wanted, and was supposed to speak until the bride told me they didn't have time for me to) | I had a family member get married about ten years ago in the middle of Pennsylvania, like the middle of an empty field where they don‚Äôt even know what Wawa or Sheetz are nowhere. Some of the grooms family showed up to the service dressed in what could charitably be called ‚Äúho‚Äù clothes - not what keyed me into the marriage probably not working. 

No it was that at the after party in the hotel bar, the bride and the best man only talked to one another and the groom got absolutely shit faced. 

Turned out the bride and the best man - the groom‚Äôs childhood best friend - had been having an affair, the bride and groom had actually already broken up before the wedding over it, and they just went through with the wedding (including filing the license for some damn reason) in order to have a party and get things off the registry. 

Haven‚Äôt dealt with that side of the family in a while. | The moment they got engaged, the more showy, the greater the likelihood of failure... | Went to the wedding of a work friend. The groom got hammered during the reception, vomited on the dance floor, and called my friend the name of his ex-gf. They were married less than a year when she came home one day to an empty house. | When walking down the isle she looked so embarrassed and looked at him like he was a cockroach | When the bride threw the ring at the groom during the reception and told him she was getting an annulment immediately. | Groom had recently come out as bisexual. He had also signed up for the Navy without telling his then girlfriend. She only found out¬†the day before he shipped out for basic training. She was super upset that he made a huge life decision that would take him away from home for long periods of time without even talking to her about it first.¬†


So he proposed to make her feel better.


The wedding was a small affair and most of the reception was all the guests (half jokingly) betting how long it would be before he got caught cheating since he had only just come out as bisexual and would now be away for months at a time living on ships with mostly young men.


It was 2 months. And apparently it was many, many times nor just the one slip up. | when the groom got so drunk that he embarrassed himself playing the guitar and serenading the bride but the bride was elsewhere crying | When the groom, followed by groom‚Äôs father, followed by the bride‚Äôs dad went into a private room one after the other for time with the stripper at the bachelor party. The tension in the air the next day at the ceremony was heavy. It was almost as if we were at a wake for three marriages. | When my best friends mother in law kept ""bantering"" her and all of us bridesmaids (I'm gay and wore a purple kilt). We spent two days setting up her house and making sure everything was nice and food was done.

Good lord this BITCH had a complaint about EVERYTHING. I was ready to fucking strangle her my own self. My best friend has less patience and more anger issues than I do; I'm honestly surprised she didn't get taken away on a stretcher as many times as I had to escort her away from the bride. | One of my uncles weddings was this outdoor hippy event with tents and everyone was definitely taking psychedelics. That was pretty much their thing. Knowing him, he could've been the one selling the drugs or passing them out at the time. They weren't getting officially married, they just had the weird ceremony. I didn't understand, because I was a child, but I remember it pretty well and everything I remember is a red flag. | Why do these people even get married? Also stop feeding each other cake. | The night before. We were in the room next door wondering if we should say something or not. It was so sad. | Waiting 30 minutes for the best man to show up.  Bride & groom couldn't keep people waiting, so they started the ceremony without him.  In the middle of the vows, best man finally showed up disheveled and obviously hungover. 

During the cake ceremony, the groom tried a small attempt at the ""cake smash"" (tried to dab a little on the bride's cheek), but bride would have nothing to do with it and stared daggers at the groom.  Yeah, everyone noticed.

Oh wait - that was my wedding (and it didn't last past 5 years thankfully).

Best man got the help he needed and is still one of my best friends. | When we took bets at the rehearsal dinner on how long they would be married.   It was about 18 months. | I was maid of honor. The bride decided, after the rehearsal festivities, to have a little fun with the lead singer of the wedding band in his van. That marriage did NOT last long. | Not at the wedding but during their engagement .

My cousin is Indian so it was semi - arranged. The girl is attractive and slim. My cousin weighed  150 more pounds than her and is unattractive .

Everyone one in my family knew that she‚Äôs marrying him for a green card . His dad even advised him not  to marry her but my cousin insisted .

She got her GC and filed for divorce .  To top it off she had a BF who was living illegally in the Us before she got married | Way before the wedding. I told a friend, ""I give it three years."" 

Totally called it. | Two of my childhood neighbors were marrying each other. Groom was late to the (strict Catholic) ceremony and showed up mildly drunk with a flask in hand. About three days after their wedding the bride found out the groom was doing pills and heroin and he went to rehab leaving her with their three kids.


She proceeded to have another kid with him, and he proceeded to cheat on her with some girl from his work and abandon the entire family. | When the bride and best man (who apparently hated each other) did a dance with so much chemistry I‚Äôm surprised they didn‚Äôt burn the place down. ¬†It wasn‚Äôt a slow dance either, it was to The Cramps or something, and they never even touched.¬† | Groom was only allowed his parents and siblings at his wedding, bride had over 100 guests including random co-workers with plus ones.¬†


Unfortunately lasted six years and two kids, but on the upside she left with a guy to Australia so the kids are being raised happily by their dad with lots of family locally.¬† | When the best man‚Äôs (groom‚Äôs brother) speech included how much he loved the bride and everyone thought it was weird except the bride. | When the first time I saw the bride she was 2 hours late to her own wedding and so pregnant I could practically hear the shotgun shells from her side of the family. Oh and her entire friend group got to come but barely any of the grooms people did. The bridal party seemed like everyone hated everyone else with a surprisingly naked amount of venom. Oh and the amount of casual disrespect from her side was shocking - I was trying to be friendly I introduced myself to some people and the response was ‚Äúdid you fuck (the bride) or (the groom)?‚Äù and everyone there laughed until I said ‚Äúno actually I‚Äôm (the groom)‚Äôs cousin, from the west coast‚Äù and it got quiet. Like I give AF that he‚Äôs bi/gay but if he‚Äôs in the closet don‚Äôt out him to stranger‚Äôs that‚Äôs fucked up. Her uncle was rambling on to me at one point about how bad an influence my cousin was on her, one of my cousins‚Äô groomsmen was getting a drink with me near the end and he said ‚Äúit was nice to meet you Crumb, at least there was some good today‚Äù and then tossed his drink back and left. The vibes were absolutely wretched. Oh and the venue staff despised the ever loving crap out of us, which is valid, and although I/a few others tried to apologize for the delays and what not they weren‚Äôt having it. 

Technically they‚Äôre still together but it does not sound like it is happy from what the family gossip chain claims. Our family does not like her at all though so who knows?! Haven‚Äôt seen them since. | A schoolfriend got married when he was 22. His wife-to-be was in her late 20s  and had been in a relationship previously.

Throughout the wedding and reception, apart from the obvious ""I do"" bit, the ex was not only present but acting like he was the groom. She sat with him (and his family) at the reception. Afterwards she left for the hotel with her ex, leaving her new husband to make his own way (and try and explain the situation to some very confused departing wedding guests)

I'm not even sure if it lasted a month. | When the step-brothers of the bride broke the groom‚Äôs orbital bone and landed him in the hospital for their wedding night. Surprisingly enough, they are still married 10 years later and have 2 kids. Step-brothers are no longer step-bro‚Äôs though. | They had problems going into the marrage and these stupid fks though bringing in the us goverment with a legal binding contract to work shit out was going to fix their problems. I knew both of them not super close but at least once each said something like i should get(her) pregnant and then he/she can't leave me.¬† | When I was the best man and part of my speech was ""I've known her for at least 30 minutes"" after saying I've known him since childhood. Dude was married 5 times in a span of 5 years. | When the couple seems distant or uncomfortable during the reception, it can be a sign of underlying issues. Body language and awkward interactions with each other's families also speak volumes. It‚Äôs often in these small moments that you can sense trouble brewing. | Well at one, I learned day of the bride had slept with the best man, so. Hubby learned about it a few years later after she found out he had cheated on her multiple times. Hubby turned real abusive. She‚Äôd only cheated once. One time with one guy. He had multiple affairs that went on for months before moved on to someone else. 

But he put cameras on her after learning about her and the best man‚Äôs pre wedding hook up. She then found a tracker on her car. He was in her email, phone. Constant accusations. It was nuts. She did get out, but they had kids, so she‚Äôs not fully free of him. | During the cake eating thing, the bride asks the groom not to smash the cake in her face as it could ruin her wedding gown. 

She then proceeds to feed him first, but before he could take a bite smashes cake on *his*  face. 

The groom then smashes a slice into *her*  face. She *knew*  she screwed up because she kept reminding him not to do it. 

Even teenage me recognized it was a bad relationship the moment she did that. 

Marriage was annulled the next day. | It was a beach wedding.  Bride was dressed like a stripper with her tits almost out. Divorced in under 5 years | When they said ""does anyone abject"" and people started looking around.  You could tell they were all hoping someone would. | When the bride disappeared from the reception only to be tracked down to the only open bar in town where she was with her ex bf/current AP their entire wedding night. | When the groom said that, he wasn't sure they should get married when the officiant asked if anyone had any objections to the marriage. They got married anyway | Shoving cake in the face with malicious intent | The bride was crying at the rehearsal dinner because the groom was more interested in watching a football game on his phone in a corner than partake in the dinner or any of the activities.¬† | Groom 1 and groom 2. Groom 1 was so invested in the details being perfect. Groom 2 later admitted to me how alone he felt earlier in the day because Groom 1 was so distracted and there was no connection before or after the ceremony.¬† | When I heard about the engagement. 

One of my then girlfriend/now wife's friends from high school had joined the army and got in trouble for hooking up with her squad leader. There were a whole string of other discipline issues with those two before the wedding rolled around right before he was set to deploy to Iraq. Even dumb Navy ROTC me could see this wasn't a good idea. 

Go figure, he cheated on her while he was on deployment and they were divorced just over a year later. To this day it was the easiest divorce I've ever seen coming. | When the wife glared at the audience daring anybody to speak up with any reason they shouldn‚Äôt be married. | Groom and bride were different races.  The bride and groom side of the family did not interact. They looked like they disliked each other.  I was a kid so I didn't fully grasp the tension but I could still tell it was less happy than other weddings I've been to. | When the groom started yelling about the day being ruined because his new wife had invited quote ""woke types"" to the wedding - lasted less than a year

When the groom rented a ferrari to drive away from the ceremony in to show off and crashed said ferrari almost immediately because he'd tried going 80mph in a 30mph zone, jumped a curb and cut a lamppost in half, putting the pair in hospital \[i personally wasn't at that wedding, that one's from my brother\]

When BOTH the bride and groom invited MULTIPLE former partners, both clearly hoping at least one would confess to still wanting them back. None did thankfully as it would have ruined the afterparty which had a free bar - lasted about a year and a half

And now for a bonus story from my trans friend who has attended lots of LGBTQA+ weddings

One member of the gay couple invited an ex who there were clearly no remaining feelings for. His husband had a full rant at him using the phrase ""you never told me you'd dated someone like *him*"". The ex in question was a black man - lasted maybe 2-2.5 years, | Pretty much as soon as I got there, but it was my now wife's family, and she wouldn't let me stop it, as she didn't want them to hate me, I think they lasted 3 weeks tops, dude, didn't have a ring, didn't kiss the bride, wouldn't do a speech, literally got changed into sports wear before the reception. It was a shit show from start to finish | The bride (who I didn't know) spent 30 minutes talking to me during the reception about how bad her husband is in bed, and how she misses having one night stands and having loads of good sex.

Also, his speech was how much he loved her, but the best man speech, maid of honour speech, and the brides speech were also about how much he loved her. How he would wait hours for her to turn out for dates etc. No mention of her loving him at all. | I got drunk and was flirting with a guy towards the end of the reception and blurted out ‚Äúso should we make a bet on how long this lasts?‚Äù He said a year, I was hopeful and said two years. This wager was set as the wedding was getting shut down for disturbing the peace (turns out you shouldn‚Äôt have raucous weddings in residential areas). 

I ended up marrying that guy and we saw the bride and groom through their very messy and drawn out divorce about 18 months later, we lasted longer than they did. | We caught a glimpse of them taking photos. She was on all fours with her tongue out and he was patting her like a dog. 

Prior to them meeting he joked that his dog was is one and only love, so he thought it would be funny for his new wife to pose as a dog in her wedding dress. 

They divorced within the year. 


He‚Äôs an old money nepo baby. She‚Äôs a beautiful, bright, well paid, attorney and often found herself as the butt of his jokes. | In my first marriage....about the time of us going home. Her making a big argument that she'd drive told me it was on a time limit. | Not proud of this. I slept with the bride a week before the wedding.¬† | During the first dance when the groom went to kiss the bride and she turned her head away. She also smashed his face with cake. He did not do that to her. They were divorced within 3 months. | When the bride tried to kiss me (best man) after having a few too many drinks | Before the wedding actually, they went from 3 dates to getting married in 6 weeks. I was told I was a bridesmaid (this was a step-sister). She was getting married because she was jealous from my wedding a year earlier. She got pregnant on their honeymoon and he left here shortly after the baby was born. | A couple of my friends got married and I offered to make the wedding cake. They bought the topper and it was a bride and groom with a ball and chain. They also had ball and chain tattoos inked onto their fingers. I knew it wasn‚Äôt going to last, and 3 years later they split up. | They meet the guests/take photos with them separately, instead of together. | In the wedding? When he went off to smoke pot with his buddy‚Äôs at the reception. Before? When he said because he thinks she‚Äôll like it to the question why do you want to get married. 

She‚Äôs now happily married to one of the groomsmen. With two kids. So far there‚Äôs nothing obvious they‚Äôd split up. | Two cases where I was certain at the wedding:
1. The day they announced their engagement.  Co-dependent couple that feigned having their shit together well enough.  Groom has opiate addiction, bride was blackout level alcoholic (likely domestic abuser).  Wedding was nice but knew it wouldn‚Äôt last.

2. Groom disappeared for a while during the reception, spent time outside arguing with bride, then sucker punched the brother of bride at the end of the reception. | Right after they cut the cake and she shoved the whole thing in his face. That's not a good sign for future compromise. | When they called and said they were engaged | When the ‚ÄòI dos‚Äô were followed by a very enthusiastic ‚Äòwe‚Äôll see!‚Äô clearly, the commitment was still being worked out. | He was drunk at the ceremony and grumpy from the start. | He kept making eye contact with me during the ceremony. Im flatterred but not a good sign | Before | She projectile vomited at the altar. 
They made it a year I think. | Not during the wedding per se but the fact that they had been living together before the wedding and decided to move at their own individual places immediately after the wedding. | Wedding 1) when I realized both bride and groom were tripping balls at their reception. I knew they were a little wild but something about not taking the event, with all their family and friends seriously made my antennae go up

Wedding 2) when an hour before the ceremony as I was catching up with the other bridesmaids as the bride and groom took photos and they told me a few days prior the bride slept over at each of their houses (separate nights) because the groom told her he was so embarrassed to be with her. We learned 8 months later He was actively cheating on her for over a year and they divorced shortly after | When groom told me he didn't want to get married to her 1 year before their wedding but she was forcing him.   
Also when he started cheating on her just before their honeymoon, went on the honeymoon, came back almost got caught... Yeah I didn't think his marriage was gonna last much longer. | There have been a few. 

Sister twice. First time was when she was only 21. She was more into the wedding and honeymoon than the marriage. When she was walking down the aisle she was sobbing because she had just been threatened by her future mother-in-law. She was second guessing the marriage, but was terrified of her MIL. They lasted a couple of years. 

Sister started dating husband number two the day after her divorce went through. He moved in the next day. He was lazy and had anger issues. No one thought it should happen, but you can‚Äôt tell her what she should and shouldn‚Äôt do. He was more interested in having a party than an actual wedding. Plus he was mad that our parents didn‚Äôt pay for a big wedding for them because he wanted to wear a tux. They said she already got her wedding. Marriage lasted a little longer. She‚Äôs now happily married to number 3. 

Friend was in a very rocky relationship. She ended up pregnant and is from a very Catholic family. They started planning a big church wedding quickly. She lost the baby, but they went ahead with the wedding. They both looked like deer in the headlights. They lasted about 10 years and 2 kids, but no one thought it would last a year. Once they separated, they became really good friends and great co-parents. But their relationship was rocky as hell. | I knew when I was walking towards him and he was white as a ghost. And when he shoved the cake in my face kinda hard.¬† | Not at the wedding but the wedding night we were at the groom‚Äôs house with a bunch of the groom‚Äôs friends staying there from out of state because the bride and groom were going on their honeymoon and the groom let them stay at his house. 

We were sitting around talking and drinking and suddenly the limo pulled up. Out jumped the bride still in her wedding dress. She saw us all there and looked pissed. I don‚Äôt know if he didn‚Äôt tell her he let us stay there or what. (They weren‚Äôt living together yet.) 

She asked if we had any cigarettes. None of us smoke so no. She jumped back in the limo and screamed at the driver to take her to 7-11 to buy some god damned cigarettes. We were in shock.

The groom apologized for her and got in the limo with her. It didn‚Äôt last long. | The Groom was MIA for most of the night- it was so awkward and I felt awful for the bride who had to keep going off to find him. Huge red flag. | After the ceremony we were hanging out with the bride, brides father and the groom (they just had a baby, 6 months old) they were all doing lines off the bar. The two men went to prison a year later. They got divorced and the groom overdosed about 3 years after getting out of prison. Sad. | When she cheated on me with him and he was already physically abusing her.

Wed in October.

Divorced in December.

The bride's recently dead father was plastered all over their event. it was more of a funeral party wedding. I was allowed because her little brother liked me more than her Groom (We bonded through gaming.) because he was having a tough time dealing with the loss of his father, as anyone would and i was the next older male in his life that bothered to give him the time of day. | My older brother (he's almost 20 yrs older than me) was estranged from us for 7 yrs between me being 11-18. In that time he married the woman he had been dating for over a decade (we all knew her really well) on a boat wedding, invited only us 4 younger siblings and the other 2 older ones and not our parents (as if us, as literal children could go without them lol the youngest at the time was about 5?üòÖ She didn't even really know him) and then they proceeded to get married, get completely wasted, get into a HUGE fight where they ended up being arrested for getting into a punch up with each other, and apparently had to annull the marriage because the certificate had already been sent or something 

TA DA! Done and dusted in less than 24 hrs. 

Absolute looney bins. | I was with a group of friends, and most of us knew before the bride made it to the altar. The littlest flower girl ran to help the Maid/Matron of Honor when she saw she was carrying the train of the bride's dress, and the bride went from gentle smile to furious glare when she missed intercepting her as she ran by. The rest of the group got it when she cut off the kiss and pulled away so she could use a mirror to check her face and hair before they turned to be presented as married. 

They got married maybe six weeks before the end of spring quarter our third year of college, and he moved back in with his parents and hired a divorce attorney about six months later when fall quarter ended for the long winter break. He got her brother and several of her sisters in the divorce, plus a lot of time with her parents because they loved him so much. | 5 minutes after meeting her. 9 months before the wedding. I started a pool on how long they would be together. I had 6 months. 5 months and 29 days after the wedding she goes to a party. He has to work (I believe he was running a snow plow). Hes gonna meet up with her at the party after hes done. Well, as fate would have it, he got done early. He walks in the front door in time to see her come out of the bathroom with her ex and shes straightening her clothes. I won $400. | I hate it when at the wedding reception the brides father takes his pockets to his pants out, to show he‚Äôs broke due to paying for the wedding.

Also, brides parents take out a loan to pay for wedding and their still paying on the loan, after daughter has been divorced for several years. | When the bride showed zero interest in welcoming¬† any of the grooms friends who had travelled for the wedding.¬† She just about said hello to us. She put him through an awful time till they finally separated many years later. Also my wife took an instant dislike to her which is rare.¬† | Bride said groom was a burden in her vows | Groom, big former high school jock, boisterous southern frat boy, was so drunk at the ceremony he could hardly stand. Huge inflated ego. She (wonderful person!!!), from big money; father (great guy) owned several car dealerships. Dad gave him a pity job and groom still cheated on her just after her wedding night. This was a connection through my wife who went to catholic school with the bride. He was hitting on girls during the reception. She went on to a happier life. | During family photos right after the ceremony, the brides father, who had just spent about 100k on his only daughter's¬†wedding, drink in hand from the open bar he was paying for, sighed and said ""well, the odds aren't for for them, are they?"" | When they did a forced pantomime routine to the song ‚ÄúHard Knock Life‚Äù from *Annie* about how tumultuous their relationship was but they muddled through it anyway‚Ä¶they‚Äôre getting divorced now. Both of them were too petulant and immature (at 35!) to listen whenever someone said ‚Äúmaybe this isn‚Äôt the right person for you‚Äù

They tried to fix by having a kid, they eventually adopted a child and now the poor kid is stuck in a home with two monstrous harridans who hate each other but have no money to live apart from each other. They made their beds and this unfortunate child is being forced to lie in it. | After the ceremony I heard the groom just tearing his mom a new one at the reception. Knew then he was not going to be a good husband. | We all knew Brenda was much too lazy and Eddie could never afford to live that kinda life. | Before the wedding. And yes they did divorce. The bride was a total narcissist. The husband finally got counseling and he told us his now adult child is just like the mother. | When the entire wedding party, including the groom, were playing pull tabs during the bride and grooms first dance. 

They lasted about a year. | Their arrival song at the reception was ‚ÄúCrazy bitch‚Äù. I already knew she was crazy, I‚Äôm a friend of the groom, but I feel so bad for him that they are still married‚Ä¶. His birthday is in November, both kids born in August, I can do the math, poor guy gets pussy once a year and she‚Äôs a stay at home mom, yet I guarantee he does the house work. 

I‚Äôm a female saying this by the way. He‚Äôs not allowed to have friends anymore, male or female. He was a great guy, I wish he‚Äôd ended up with someone that deserved him. | My husband wouldn‚Äôt let my mum (or anyone else) babysit our child for our wedding night. So he went back to the hotel & I went out for my first night out after having the baby without him. 3 years later we seperated because he just couldn‚Äôt understand why a mother wouldn‚Äôt want to spend every second with her kids. We have 50/50 custody now & I love my kid free time! | Pre-wedding day when they are already incompatible.

Anybody getting married because she's pregnant. | When the groom recited his vows, he looked out a window instead of at the bride. | Tensions during the ceremony | They had never been ‚Äútogether‚Äù for more than 3 weeks. They were on again/off again for a couple of years. On a whim they went to the courthouse. The marriage didn‚Äôt even last 2 months. | My wife and I went to one of her friends' kid's wedding. Our room was directly beneath the newlyweds at the hotel.  They had a 4 hour screaming session on their wedding night. The marriage lasted less than a year. | When they were cutting the cake and they were having a shouting match | I thank goodness I haven't been to that many weddings. | Before I walked down the aisle. | Planned Vegas wedding. When the groom took us to Hooters the night before, then the day of proceeded to start an hours (like 4-5 hours) long fight with her entire family about nothing. Literally, I think it was about whether anyone should go out or not-it was so unnecessary I can‚Äôt recall what exactly they were all arguing about. I just remember talking to him trying to escalate him, thinking ‚ÄòI hope you appreciate this wedding gift because I never want to talk to this man ever again, but I‚Äôm doing it for you Amy!‚Äô

He turned out to be a deadbeat and convicted stalker, so there you go! | When the groom started seeing the bridesmaid a lot. | My cousin‚Äôs (then) wife was walking across the dance floor at the reception while a group of people were dancing around and having fun. One guy was standing there with a beer in hand just smiling and vibing when all of a sudden the bride yells ‚ÄúMOVE‚Äù at his back in a loud, flat, ANGRY voice. I guess that might not sound too bad to describe but goddam, how jarring and unnecessary in such an otherwise lighthearted and fun atmosphere (during the reception and after all the formal events lol). They made it a year. | When the bride‚Äôs off-again-on-again ex had to calm her down before she walked down the aisle. Surprise! They were divorced a year later over something dumb and she dated her Ross for a year before breaking up again for good. | When they don't match each other energy. | Groom brings date to rehearsal dinner. Even his friends were appalled. | One, the Groom clearly had a thing with the brides maid. I'm saying this to be funny.


Second, the Groom had multiple affairs just before the wedding. Bride knew. Groom made deal. Fiance could have two cheats for ever one of his. She had no desire to have affairs.


Third, Bride had her parents die when she was fourteen. Messed her up emotionally. Raised her in fostercare does that. She had fortune coming to her the groom's parents thought. Uncle got the money. Parents hounded the wife into a abortion and divorce when found she was broke. Uncle paid for great lawyer. The husband lost everything. She moved with uncle. He would've taken her in, but he was gay. It was blocked.¬† She got the family, and her inheritance. Yeah, everyone knew at the wedding the Groom was after her money. | They played ‚ÄúNo Children‚Äù by the Mountain Goats as their wedding song. | I became friendly with a good friend‚Äôs cousin-to-be when we went out one night. She invited me to her bachelorette and wedding. I‚Äôm ND and impulsive af and we seemed to get on super well so it didn‚Äôt strike me as odd in the moment. For the bachelorette, the plan was meeting at my friend‚Äôs house in our small town to pregame with an MLM kind of party and get ready together before taking a limo to the nearest big city for clubbing. The bride-to-be asked me if I‚Äôd be willing to do her hair and makeup before going out and I happily agreed. 

Plot Twist 1: No one told me it would be a joint bachelor/bachelorette. Dudes just started showing up to go to the city with us and I had to ask‚Ä¶ 

Plot Twist 2: She got shitfaced at the house and started screaming at me that I lied because she didn‚Äôt know where I was and she wanted her hair and makeup done IMMEDIATELY. (I snuck away to quickly do my own so I could take my time on hers because it was her event.) I tried to calm her down, figuring this was abnormal, and did the best I could on her angry red face. She just kept screaming at her future husband. 

Plot Twist 3: We stopped at a gas station halfway to the clubs because a bunch of people had to pee. The cops were called because one member of our party thought another was taking too long in the bathroom and started trying to physically break down the door. We legit had to RUN and beg the limo to step on it. 

Plot Twist 4: We were at the club for about 2 hours before a buuuuunch of the future wedding party was fist fighting and being taken out in cuffs. 

I ended up running into an ex and his friends at the club, explaining who the people being taken out in cuffs were, and saying ‚ÄúSooooo what if I just stayed at your buddy‚Äôs house tonight and didn‚Äôt have to go anywhere else with those crazy people?? That‚Äôd sure be nice‚Ä¶‚Äù üòÖ A couple friends‚Äô significant others thought I left with a random dude. (Side Note: They threatened him ‚Äúto make sure he treated me well‚Äù in spite of me explaining it was all good and I had known this man for yeaaaaaars and we were still super cool, and then never allowed me to hang with their gfs/wives again because they thought I was a sl*t‚Ä¶ Fun! ü´†) I ended up at the casino all night and then going to another state to pickup a puppy for the parents of my ride home‚Ä¶all in my outfit from the club and last night‚Äôs makeup. 

I didn‚Äôt go to the wedding after all that mess but the marriage lasted almost a year somehow. | Well he showed up sloshed and tried to start a fight with the bride and the brides mom. Brides son did not put up with it, sucker punched the groom and then berated his mother for her choice in men. That was a fun afternoon.¬† | The bride was dancing with one of the groomsmen and asked him if she made the right choice marrying the groom.  Our friend (the groomsman), at first, thought she was joking.  When he realized she was not, he was at a loss for words. | When the bride and groom were  going through their wedding pictures and the bride selected a photo of her alone in a wedding dress to printed  21x28 to be hung over the mantelpiece. | When the groom went missing at the reception for a while, then was finally located in bed in the honeymoon suite with the maid of honour. I was wrong though, 10 years later they are still chaotic but still together. | Used to play in a popular wedding band.  We had a roadie who had a way with the ladies.  
Before the gig started, we needed to get a couple of items from the van. 
Opened the door to the back of the van only to find him shoulders deep between the brides legs. 
They stopped immediately when she was informed that the first dance would be starting in 5 minutes.  
She did the first dance with her new husband. 
I have no idea how that marriage ended up long term. | Probably when the groom and his grooms party disappeared and left the bride sitting alone, being asked ""where is your new husband?"" and didn't reappear for 2 hours.

I was the bride. Apparently they thought a wedding was a bros event where you hang out with friends. I was so embarrassed. | During the cake cutting ceremony and one of them smashes the cake in the other's face, instead of gently feeding them. The person getting the cake-smash looks surprised and angry and the other person is laughing it off. 

I don't know why anyone thinks this is funny - it's mean and crappy to embarrass your new spouse in front of everyone. I've seen this at a couple of weddings and was not surprised that the couples did not go the distance. | Are there statistics about the whole ‚Äúcake smashing in the face‚Äù thing? | When he obnoxiously wiped his mouth with his sleeve after the kiss. | Bride spent the reception in their hotel suite with all of her bridesmaids. Grandmother of the groom called it within an hour after the ceremony. ‚ÄúThis will never last.‚Äù

They divorced 6 weeks later. | Cake cuttings are always super telling‚Ä¶. | I was a plus-one at this wedding, people that my fiance knows through his work.

The groom was the conservative religious type who didn't believe in sex before marriage. When he saw his bride the first time, coming up the aisle, she was wearing an off-the-shoulder wedding dress, with a really prominent tattoo of her ex's name on her chest.

He walked out. | When I see the bride and groom do the ‚Äúsmash cake in the face‚Äù thing in an aggressive, competitive way. | My older brothers second wedding. He got married in a church and as the service started a huge storm blew in with lightening and thunder. As the lights flickered on and off and the priests microphone kept cutting out, I leaned over to my wife and said, ""this is an omen"". The marriage lasted less than 2 years. | My best friend‚Äôs wife told me she planned to stay at home when they had kids. I told her it‚Äôs not good for a marriage when the kids are in school all day long. A few years later they have kids. When her kids are in school all day. She goes to the gym for 3 hrs a day. Just found out the wife met some guy at the gym and wants a divorce. I called it from day one. | When I learned it was an open relationship | when they seemed to have a lot of tension and weren‚Äôt communicating well it was clear that they were struggling with some major issues that might not be easy to fix long term | When she was 8 months pregnant and 18 | During the vows.  They had their own and one of her lines was something like, ‚Äúlet there be wide spaces for the wind to blow and us to grow‚Äù or some shit. | The viral gone Uzbek wedding where the groom hit her...

But...I think they have to be together. Still. 

So sad on many instances. | When the invitations went out and she kicked him out again. | This is something that tends to be obvious before the wedding. | Usually before. | It became clear at the wedding that all his love went to himself. It didn‚Äôt last a year. | In the vows instead of ""till death do us part"" it was something like ""for the next 10 years""....they lasted less than 1.

Guy had been cheating on her for 3 years prior to the wedding.  WTF is workg with people and why the hell would you get married if you have been cheating BEFORE the wedding. I don't understand dumbass people. | When they got engaged | They fought every minute of their relationship and fought all through the wedding. | They kept arguing about the music volume. It was during the reception and they were both toasted. But they were really pissed about the situation at each other. | When the groom's close friends and second family have a betting pool at the wedding on how long the marriage will last. | Before the wedding. | When he tried to shove the cake in her mouth while feeding it to her off the metal cake knife ü´¢üéÇü•Ç | Prior to engagement involved friends in a fight over master bating. Fast forward a couple months they went on vacation and they get in a fight because he didn't propose her dream way. He wasn't planning on it. He proposes next day. They were dating 6 months. 
Fast forward a year. Spent half the time living together but fighting so bad they are sleeping in different bedrooms. Got married. Constantly fighting with his family and went no contact with them. Got pregnant. Still not stable. Threaten divorce every 3 months. Finally get divorced when kid is about a year old. Attempt to get back together month later. All this was over 3 years. | Neither of them looked remotely happy to be there. Only smiled for photos. üò¨ | I‚Äôm pretty sure it was just after I finished my speaking part. | When the groom (both friends of mine) called me right before heading to the wedding, and asked me ""what the hell am I doing?""

I convinced him that he just had cold feet, but nah, they didn't last long. | The ceremony. For no discernable reason. They had been together for almost ten years at that point, but the thought went through my head: They're gonna have a nice three years. 

And they did. And now they are separated. | The night before when I met the groom | I sometimes think this once the wedding is actually announced; when it seems like a last ditch effort to resolve a long lasting but failing relationship. 

After a decade together, they married & then divorced soon after. Saved myself a bit of money by going with my gut on that suspicion and not attending. | When I, the groom, gave a toast and had nothing to say | I can't recall many I thought that at the wedding but tons and tons while they were dating before the marriage. | The announcement of the engagement. | When the best man‚Äôs speech opened with a joke about doing cocaine? Or possibly when one of the grooms senior citizen uncles was speaking to one of the brides friends who decided it‚Äôd be a great idea to beat him (senior uncle) up?

I think they lasted a year, certainly longer than anyone expected. | before they met | Let's be honest, has nobody here watched PornHub before? | Was at a wedding with an absolutely stunning bride. The Groom started his reception speech with, ‚Äòtoday I watched my bride ‚Äòwaddle‚Äô up the aisle!‚Äô My buddy and i decided to drink up enough to cover the costs of our gifts knowing it wouldn‚Äôt last‚Ä¶..and it didn‚Äôt. | At the reception, the groom got up to give a speech and spent most of the time jokingly roasting the bride about things she ‚Äòneeds to change‚Äô now that they‚Äôre married. You could see the awkwardness on her face and the tension in the room. It was like, dude, read the room‚Äîthis isn't Comedy Central. It was clear from that moment that they had some serious communication issues! | we were at the rehearsal. groom missed the only turn off to the venue on the highway so was going to be 20 minutes late. rather than wait, the bride to be grabbed his best man and made him rehearse the wedding with her, acting in the groom‚Äôs place. we all just kinda went with it but yeah they (the real groom and bride) didn‚Äôt last.¬† | The brides dad jokingly told my date and I, he didn‚Äôt get why they were even getting married.
They divorced a year later. | I knew my brother's marriage wasn't gonna last before they even got engaged 

Nothing scandalous. She was just a bitch to everybody, him included. They lasted 2 years and that was well beyond my expectations. 

Silver lining, though. He's engaged to a chick that genuinely loves him now. We all think she's pretty dope. | The bride's family expected their soon-to-be son-in-law to support their entire family (parents claimed disability, bride and her sister worked minimum wage). They wanted to do a pizza party wedding in the backyard, but expected the other side to cover it all. (The grooms family made the dishes, they rented a cheap hall). Their wedding was very un-memorable, but they broke up so quickly that we heard of the divorce before we got our bank statements back showing they cashed the checks. | When he got really drunk. Like REALLY. | As soon as I showed up late right in the mid of the ceremony‚Ä¶they divorced 1.5 yr later | When I was sitting in the car outside the church waiting to go in. | It was clear before due to their lifestyle. However, when there was more than one fight between the groom and her exes who knew about everything and someone almost got stabbed, it was extremely clear. | It hasn't happened yet!! but it's coming up extremely soon within the next couple days, and I'm fully concerned that it's not going to work out. this is someone that is a married in relative, not someone I'm related to. but I just can't foresee this going on for very long. there's hella red flags and me and my sibling agree that we're not sure how long this is going to go on for. | It rained when they did the vows. Just bad omen and bride was selfish. They divorced | When she said I don't üíÄ | The groom (1) had spent about half a million dollars on the wedding, honeymoon, new car and some extra stuff. Money they did not have. The other groom (2) was not informed of this until after the honeymoon. They went into a debt spiral and divorced after about three years. He (1) kept spending money they didn't have and making the debt worse. He (1) had a house of his own, but sold it for way less than it was worth to pay for a part of the wedding, and the groom (2) had actually hoped they'd move into that house since it was much closer to his (2) job. 

The man was in over his head and never realised how much his newly found husband loved spending money, or he was blinded by love. Either way, he got really depressed for a few years but he's doing better now | Immediately. The marriage ended two weeks after the honeymoon. | A week before. I stayed with them to help get things ready and it was awful. She whined at him constantly and he put her down and flirted with me (I did not flirt back).  I was kind of appalled, but just kept smiling and playing along.  Evidently he started cheating immediately. | Probably when they smashed cake in each other's faces instead of feeding each other like civilized adults. | They were virgins, married without kissing and having sex, early 20s and they were religious | When the groom tried to kiss me at the end | These stories are wild. I‚Äôm trying to think of anyone I know who has gotten divorced where I attended the wedding. Can‚Äôt think of one. | when she's needy on perfecting her wedding. | When my sister was late to being walked down the aisle and missed a majority of her wedding because she ‚Äúhad a migraine‚Äù (she was sobbing in the brides room) *and* when it was announced by the guy who wasn‚Äôt actually a minister (we thought he was ordained, not just the guy presiding over the ceremony) that they had gotten eloped 6 months previously to the entire crowd in his opening sentence üòê | The bride invited her ex-boyfriend to the wedding, who she‚Äôd been secretly texting the whole engagement. The groom had no idea until he caught them arguing outside the reception hall. By the time the cake was cut, the ex was gone‚Äîbut so was the bride. | It was her 7th wedding, his first. They threw it together in under 2 months because they wanted to have a baby. (Her 4th? Or 5th? I can‚Äôt remember. One to each of a few different husbands. All boys.) The reason they wanted to rush into having the kid was 1.) because she was older, and 2.) because he wanted to stop his grandpa from taking back the house he paid off for him and knew their Catholicism would prevent them from kicking out a pregnant woman. (The grandson didn‚Äôt make any of the payments on the house he was supposed to be making to the grandpa because he felt he was ‚Äòowed‚Äô. These were NOT poor people‚Ä¶) It lasted less than 2 months and she was re-engaged to a new dude within 6 months. | The groom started a fight at the wedding because the bride hugged someone she grew up with and considered like her older brother while he was congratulating her. (It was like omg I missed you so much, thank you for coming to my wedding kind of hug) The groom was triggered because while they hugged each other, the bride's tits touched the other men... How can someone hug without touching each other??? They broke up after 3 months because of how jealous he was. | When the groom discovered the bride had invited her secret lover to the wedding and told him the kids weren‚Äôt his¬† | I've not been to the wedding yet, it'll be this saturday.

But the fact that the bride to be came home to me and my fiancee to complain about her partner being very greedy in bed, not listening to her and her feelings and their decision to throw a baby into the mix before getting married makes me contemplate their future. | Take as old as time,
That‚Äôs actually really
Sad for both/I was

At that wedding: sounds
Like a couple that met at 
(A) Christian College.

There! I haiku‚Äôd it for you!
Y‚Äôall are good writers. ‚úçüèº | Bride's dad was the hero. Poor bride! | When they invited the whole gang on the honeymoon, because they didn't want to be alone together. | They sat in different tables during the reception. She was later crying because he was already drunk. They are still married, but...

The other couple that is actually filling paperwork for separation, got married a year after meeting each other, she got pregnant 2 months before the wedding, had to cancel the honeymoon, had to discard her very fitted dress because she was uncomfortable, refused to take pictures with the guests, had a meltdown, etc... At the end, they were too different people and I hope they can be friends for the shake of their children | A few of us were standing outside the church before the ceremony and the groom, completely out of the blue, says to me ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not too late, you know‚Äù‚Ä¶.

Just to spell it out he meant I could still be with him. He was way too old for me and I was never attracted to him. 

The marriage didn‚Äôt last. Shocking. /s | When the husbands mom came up to our table during the dinner and said that she was sure it wouldn‚Äôt last. | The guy was fat and the wife my cousin who is a pretty face but a gold digger thought  he was rich after fakely advertising his life to her then later find out it was a fraud,massive 100k wedding with helicoptes they had then divorced after 1 year | Went to a wedding of a work colleague I got along with, during the cake cutting she playfully took a bit of cake on the end of her finger and she put it in his mouth. He was quite drunk at that point and he head butted her. The brides family immediately rushed him and after about a minute or so his family then got involved and pulled them off. There wasn't a big fight between both families, his family were completly ashamed of him his dad was shouting at him. His mom was in tears with the bride it was a fucking mess. They never even went home together. I think the exact moment I knew they wouldn't stay together was when his head collided with hers. | When they announced their engagement‚Ä¶ | During the toasts. More roasting than toasting. | When the two tracks the bride selected for her entr√©e were ""Should I stay or should I go?"" from the Clash, and ""Rains of Castamere"" from Game of Thrones. At that point I told my wife we should get the fuck out of there before they bolt the doors. 

They got separated in a year, and it left my friend in shambles, but he came out of it, and is at a much better point of his life now. | The bride was a distant relative and nobody on our side of the family had met the groom or his family until the wedding. As soon as the buffet opened, three of them ran over there and picked up the trays to take back to their table. The two trays of sandwiches that were for EVERYONE and all the cocktail sausages and nibbles too. My little cousin cried because she was so hungry and she‚Äôd gone over to ask them for a sandwich and been rudely ignored. One of my cousins is celiac and brought a GF snack and we all joked that we were going to mug her for it because we were that hungry. The food hogging was one thing, but it turned out that the groom was incredibly racist. My other cousin‚Äôs husband is Pakistani and he said that he had a gut feeling the groom was racist after he ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô let the door go in his face. That gut feeling was confirmed after the groom and best man started drunkenly ranting about ‚Äòkeeping Britain British‚Äô. Their marriage was annulled before we even got our slice of wedding cake in the post.. | This guy I knew agreed to marry his girlfriend because she kept throwing tantrums and kept threatening to kill herself. He postponed the ‚Äúwedding‚Äù 3 times but eventually caved in after she took a knife to herself‚Ä¶ He didn‚Äôt tell anyone he was getting married until it was done. He just texted his mother two days before the wedding that it was happening and his father begged him to come stay with them until they can figure out how to get rid of her. The ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù lasted about two years and they spent most of it in different countries (by their own volition, not because of work or family engagements). The divorce lasted longer than the marriage because she kept insisting they stay together while telling anyone and everyone he was abusive to her. | I (M) am best friends with a girl who is like a sister to me. I was there for her first wedding, it was a shotgun weddingas she was pregnant. I warned her about him several times, so did many others, that lasted 5 years. 
Cue second wedding, nice bloke and all, does the right thing by her and the kids. But absolutely hates me cause of my relationship with his now wife üòÇ cue the kicker for their wedding. I ended up being his best man as he is a social introvert, it was a interesting day to say the least. | when he introduced his new wife to the chauffeur of their wedding day limo by accidently using his ex-wife's name | The cake-face smash. You can always tell that one, or both of the involved parties is not happy about it, and if they can't get through THAT together....buckle up, it's gonna get bumpy. | Oeh, I was at a proper british wedding in the North, near Whitehaven. It had karaoke, in a carpeted partycenter, pay for your own drinks, and several uncles getting wasted to the point they were asleep at the table. I'm from the mainland, so I was permanently amazed.. The groom was a barister/lawyer, bit of a doofus, everyone was surprised he actually hooked up. The bride was a beatiful british party animal, who brought her own hairdresser, an amazing Guido of a guy. Imagine Zoolander. They were constantly dancing together, and after the actual ceremony she didn't spend a second with her new husband. Near the end the bride got drunk and into a verbal fight with her new husband, and took off with Guido the hairdresser. That was where I thought: ""hmm, something rotten in Denmark."" It was an experience. | When the bride was late by an hour+ and to the point of cancellation and then she told us (her bridesmaids) that she was hooking up with the guy she met on the plane on JSX Burbank - LV and he had driven to see her before she got married. 

‚Ä¶.she did get married, still hooked up with the Vegas sleaze for months after and that ended and she‚Äôs still married. I‚Äôm no longer friends with her | A few weeks before the wedding when the bride texted me saying she wanted to call the whole thing off. I *really* thought she should, but her mom persuaded her into going through with it, and now they have a deeply unhappy and one sided marriage.¬† | When it felt like the grooms sister had the hots for him. 

A year later, the wife cheated with their next door neighbor and one of the groomsmen. | Groom had a one night stand with some eastern European woman, just a few weeks before the wedding, then tried to have sex with his straight best man the night before the wedding. The bride was oblivious to the ""sex addiction"" the groom claimed he had when he was caught. | When the brides sister was dancing with her dad on the wedding floor and I saw the groom checking her out. | The photo of the wedding in a Council Bluff‚Äôs casino parking lot looked like she was crying tears of fear while he‚Äôs gripping her hands. He‚Äôd disparaged her on social media weeks before calling her a ‚Äúcrazy bitch‚Äù numerous times. Then he‚Äôd change his relationship status every month like a teenager. He‚Äôs 50. She made a post detailing emotional abuse and his infidelity. Now he‚Äôs looking for a new place to live one town over. | When he turns out to be gay | Years ago, at a reception the bride was making out with the best man. | When I saw the groom push his 5 min old bride to the ground outside on the steps of a casino across from where they just got married (New Orleans) | If they don't kiss fondly enough then there must be something going wrong. | Wedding hasn't happened yet. I'm the maid of honor of the supposed wedding. Classic situation of guy giving a ""shut up"" ring and not wanting that type of commitment....despite already having kids with my friend (how is marriage more of a commitment than having kids with a person??). Anyhow for the last 4 years they'll plan a date, we'll go dress shopping or look at venues or whatever else then the wedding will get pushed back another year. It's always the guy who suggests pushing it back. He's a shitty boyfriend. He'll be an even worse husband. He leaves her every few months for a couple of weeks. There's a LOT of issues I don't feel comfortable sharing. *IF* they ever do actually get married it won't last. Him stringing her along is a blessing if she ever wakes the fuck up and leaves him. Divorce is a lot harder to do than a breakup. | During my toast to them.¬† | When my cousin didn't want to get out of the car to go in the church. | The bride just seemed thrilled with the wedding‚Ä¶the groom was just‚Ä¶there. All the speeches were about how amazing the bride was and no one had anything special to say about the groom except ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fuck this up‚Äù. Members of the bride‚Äôs family and the officiant were making bets on how long it would last. We‚Äôre only 7 months in. My bet was 3 years. | It was in Italy, the priest asked the bride if she took this man, she asked if he was talking to her. When he said yes she fled. I hear she ended up working in a nunnery. Pretty sure she was still in love with her ex. Last I heard she was a writer. Did a few TV shows and plays. The groom ended up a pretty well known radio presenter and went on to have his own talk show on TV. | Pastor here. Held a last minute detail meeting with the bride and groom a couple of days before the wedding. I could tell there was no way this was going to work. Almost backed out but went ahead with a little speech about patience. They made it two months. | For me it was when I looked at my watch during our first dance. | I was in the car with the bride on the way to the venue. She was very quiet, then asked me to hold her hand. She white knuckled it. I knew she was straight up scared. Me and her brother (as well as other family members) had been telling her she didn‚Äôt have to marry the guy.

They‚Äôve been divorced for four years now. | When the husband REFUSED to dance with bride for their first dance and yelled ‚ÄúI told you I don‚Äôt dance‚Äù and you could see the literal heartbreak and sadness from the bride‚Ä¶ defeated. And everyone was like are you fucking kidding me dude, you can‚Äôt sacrifice just one thing for your wife‚Ä¶ on your wedding day? Yeah it was awkward. I told the other bartender I was working with ‚ÄúI give it 6 months‚Äù | My coworker had a sidegig as a musician and himself were doing a duo at a wedding. He caught his sidekick banging the bride in a storage room. | I worked at a wedding, at the party afterwards with making food, where the bride made out with my waiter friend in the kitchen while the groom dropped the insanely expensive wedding cake on the floor. It did not last six months. | All of the speeches about the groom were his closest friends ""jokingly"" calling him difficult, a tyrant, bossy, etc. My cousin (the bride) is someone with a strong personality so that felt like a recipe for disaster (and it was). | Well i knew this couple that got engaged after being together 5 and a half months (that‚Äôs how long they knew each other too). and she was going on and on about how my now husband didnt propose to me that soon and kept shoving her ring in my face and i got super jealous. eventually they got married before knowing each other a whole year, and she looked miserable coming down the isle. she said she had tons of doubts about getting married, (not just normal like ‚Äúoh my gosh this is a big decision) and i straight up told her she didn‚Äôt look happy walking down the isle. she wasn‚Äôt emotional. she looked upset and sad honestly. and then she got mad at me and yelled at me and said i was a bad friend for saying that. she blamed his angry outburst at her and emotional abuse (maybe physical idk) on adhd or autism or some crap. needless to say they were married 5 months before she moved out and they lived separately for the rest of the year and then divorced. 

for context my husband proposed to me after we had been together 1.5 years, and we got married after being together 2 years. she did come to our wedding, but with our mom because her and her husband weren‚Äôt living together and weren‚Äôt in speaking terms ü•∏ | The groom was an hour late and did have his tux. | In college. A drunken, late groom to the ceremony. A pregnant bride. Working while growing a small family. Didn't last. | It started late, then he whispered his vows to her instead of saying them out loud. It was weird because she said hers out loud. They also had to ask for someone to officiate. They divorced in 6 months | When the bride got drunk, changed into a club dress, and then did a solo dance to Single Ladies. | Two days before the wedding. My brithers fiance let it slip that she was going to be wearing her first wedding dress. The woman was nuts. | I was just at my sister's wedding and that one's gonna last, I just know it. But the bridesmaid that caught the bouquet is already engaged to a guy and their wedding date is set for next year. She left 20 minutes after catching the bouquet, super pissed because she told her fianc√© to order her wine and it took too long. He did order it, it just took a while. She didn't even say goodbye or anything to the bride or groom. Apparently she also said in front of her fianc√© ""I know I could do better, I'm just tired of looking so I settled for him"". He's the sweetest guy I hope he doesn't go through with this. | I was standing with my dad at the church doors just about to make our entrance, when he said you don't have to get married you can still change your mind.  I did not and was married for 43 years until he died. | Even though I was still a kid at the time, I knew there was no way that my paternal uncle and his first wife would make it.  They met sometime around 1992 or 1993 when my dad and my uncle were sharing an apartment.  We'll just call her L.  L was in her early 20s, and my uncle was just a few years older.  They were both still very immature, while my dad was approaching 30, was much mature, and was the responsible one.  L had an attitude and a way about her that irritated the hell out of my dad when she came over to visit my uncle, but he just put up with it since he knew it wasn't his place to try to control who his brother dates.  Things were tense between my dad and L, and the relationship between L and my uncle was chaotic.  L fed into my uncle's half-baked approaches to things that would often land him in financial trouble that ended up with my dad bailing him out repeatedly.  At some point in early 1995, my dad sat down with L when my uncle wasn't around and had a long conversation, and it was apparently a highly productive one.  They smoothed over their differences and developed something like a brother-sister bond, but my uncle had no idea at all that this conversation took place until later.  In mid-1995, my dad died in an accident, and that completely broke my uncle.  L was broken up about it, too, since they just got things straight between themselves months earlier.  My uncle looked up to my dad in every way possible, and he was just lost and spiraling.  The relationship between L and my uncle grew more and more chaotic, but they still got married in 1997 anyway.  It just got worse from there.  My uncle was diagnosed with diabetes, and he didn't manage his blood sugar well.  He would lose his shit when abnormal blood sugar coincided with a heightened emotional state, such as when he was thinking about my dad, and L always reacted to it with equally flared up emotions.  I was in high school at this point, but there were times when my grandfather would get a call at 3AM about them losing it on each other.  He and I would get up and go over to their place to calm things down, and it was kind of impressive to see the authority that my grandfather projected in those situations that just made them both settle down and think straight.  My uncle and L divorced in 2002 or 2003.

After that, my uncle finally started healing from my dad's death.  He met another woman who had three kids from prior relationships, and she brought a maturity and a stability to my uncle that he really needed.  My uncle was always really good with kids, and being a dad to her kids did wonders for him.  She also didn't put up with his bullshit the way that L did, and that helped set him straight.  They got married, and he got his diabetes under control and manages it properly now.  He's a grandpa now since her kids now have kids of their own, and he's doing alright. | It was a Vietnamese wedding where the bride and groom go table to table to have a drink with the table and collect the envelopes. Half way through the 30+ tables the groom passed out and the bride had to go to the rest of the tables without him. When i was best man in another wedding we used tea and put it in the cognac bottle to be able to drink and keep standing during this part. | the look on the bride's face as she walked down to the groom | When the bride and husband kiss and it's not passionate. | When they were having a fight *during the first dance*. 

That was just the cap on a whole train of eyebrow-raising events that night: 

A bridesmaid bailed on the wedding - then showed up to the reception wearing the dress.

After putting a lot of expensive items on the registry, including duplicates of several kitchen appliances and that sort of thing, and only a few affordable items, we got to the event and ours was one of *three* items on the gift table.

The food at the reception was terrible (and it was not a cheap venue - it was on the higher end of places we checked out for my own wedding). At least two tables ordered pizza delivery to the venue after the dinner had been cleared away. Which infuriated both the venue manager and the bride. 

In the end, though, I was wrong; they're still together a decade and a half later... | The groom was hiding the bushes after the wedding was over and the bride was in her parents car screamimg for him to get in the car. He just kept saying nobody tell her I'm here . | Two major contenders-

When the groom was an hour late and the bride walked down the aisle in tears.

He anded up being a druggie and abuser, not involved his kid's lives.

Or when I walked in to the lady's room and the bride, pulling up her panty hose with a cigarette dangling from her lip, said, ""I'm gonna kick her fucking ass!""

She ended up being an abuser as well. I heard about her chasing her husband around the house with a baseball bat.

Some of my cousins really know how to pick 'em! | They had a courthouse wedding because he was getting shipped out on military deployment. They had actually broken up‚Ä¶ 3 weeks later she found out she was pregnant, they got back together, had the baby who was being born with a severe heart condition. They actually lasted 12 years before getting divorced. He was a cheating POS. Mom and daughter live together with her parents now. Kiddo had a heart transplant and is doing well. They are MUCH better off without him! | She interrupted him during his vows to correct something. Less than a year. | When the groom's best man gave a speech that was more about him than the happy couple. üò¨ | My son was a ring bearer at an outdoor ceremony, the plan was to have him walk over a long bridge over a pond that didn't have a railing. He was 2 at the time. It took a long time to explain to the bride why we didn't think this would work, and the groom seemed really irritated. Groom wasn't patient and the bride didn't seem to get things that seemed pretty common sense to the rest of us. Made for a really bad combination. | Before the wedding, I predicted my sister's marriage wouldn't last 5 years, and it actually ended after 2. | When my sister-in-law's daughter got married, I watched her walk down the aisle and whispered to my wife ""Two years, max.""  They were married just under two years.

It was a combination of the look on her face (not quite as happy as a bride should be) and the amount her parents spent on the wedding (they took a second mortgage to pay for it.)  I also thought she looked (very early) pregnant, but she wasn't.  She had a kid 11 months after the wedding. | When the bride smashed her piece of cake into the groom's face. | Saw a bride throw her wedding ring at the groom in the dance floor. Father of the bride and brother of groom then proceeded to get into a fist fight. I just stood in the corner and ate cake. | When I almost killed my mil with smoke half way through my wedding | A friend in the military called me and asked for my address. I gave it to him thinking he was mailing stuff to me. He got married to a woman he met 2 days before and used my address as his own. They made it 6 months before they were abusive towards each other and I stopped spending time with them. 3 months later they separated. Thank God they didn't reproduce. | When we noticed the groom didn't have a best man, and instead had a best woman. He ran off with her shortly after the wedding. | Overheard two groomsmen laughing about how ugly the prostitutes were at the bachelor party while in the church's bathroom after the wedding | Oh yes. Several occurrences. Typically, couples decide to marry because of children or pregnancy.  
  
I have experienced relationships with a foundation of affection, rather than intense passion, characterized by a deep bond of friendship. My dad and my former stepmother were like that. They possessed affection but not the typical Western idea of love that leads to marriage. Even as a child, I was conscious of it. | When they were doing the vows and the priest got to the ""for richer or poorer"" part and she said ""for richer or richer and maybe for poorer."" The officiant was not pleased. I think they made it a year. | this point no have time for examples | Wild Tales is an Argentine movie with 5 hilarious stories. 
The wedding is one of my favorite. 
The car chases with the trucker 
The parking lot 

Highly recommend | When he put the cake in my face | With mine it was the argument in the car to the wedding and the brilliant conclusion we reached that we couldn't just pull out as everyone was there and we had paid for everything. | The groom smashed a piece of cake in the bride‚Äôs face.  I knew it wouldn‚Äôt last. | Former boss told his just pronounced wife to ""Shut Up"". She slowly looked down in shame as we all set and watched. Wedding moved on. They cut the cake. Etc. Etc.

She eventually took him for half of everything less than a year later. Think she received 1.2 mil. | So I went to a sorta military college, and the army does a program for cadets where if you take a foreign language you can spend a summer in a country that speaks said language for free to immerse yourself in it. Well we had this one guy who studied Russian and man, this guy was ugly, I'm not a judgemental fella but this man probably hit every branch when he fell down the ugly tree, but lo and behold after 3 months in Kazakhstan he comes back with an absolutely gorgeous Kazakh wife.

Well, maybe I'm an asshole but I figured then and there it was a money thing, army officers do make a decent amount, but fast forward 2 years and he was arrested for treason and his wife (who was a Russian agent) has disappeared 

I believe he got out on bail for a bit, but he was quickly found shot 3 times, once in the head, I'll let you spin your own conspiracy theories as to what happened there | One of those strange but true.  I knew before the wedding the marriage was in for trouble when the bride knocked on my hotel door at about 12:30AM the day of the wedding.  I was right.  Married for a year, divorced, remarried, divorced, and finally shacking up with some idiot.  A few years later we eventually called her ""rainbow"" because she gave birth to white, black and brown babies. | I was the best man for my friend, at his wedding I asked his then wife what it was like to be married, she said ""it still feels like at anytime I can leave if I want""..lol they were married for 6 years, longer than I thought they would make it?? | When they [headbutted and tried to choke their bride](https://web.archive.org/web/20150303041358/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-28/darwin-groom-tried-headbutt-and-choke-wife-police-say/6271050)

Or shot her: [shot her, her family and himself](https://people.com/groom-kills-bride-her-family-and-himself-within-hours-of-wedding-8407450) | I assume every marriage is going to fail. | When I said I do | When the bride and groom were in a polyamorous relationship with an additional guy (groom was asexual and would only do the deed for procreation, bride was horny af and needed a boy toy) but her daddy couldn‚Äôt know or else he wouldn‚Äôt pay for the wedding. She also felt the need to hide the boy toy relationship from me even though we were besties since HS and I never gave a hint that I would care or judge. 

Bride and her amoeba were divorced within a year for a dumb reason. She married the boy toy and they have a baby together now. Had to find out about her divorce through her hairdresser, who was also my sister‚Äôs hairdresser, who told my sister. She never answered my calls or texts when I reached out to see how she was doing. üôÑ | Consider moments that might reveal underlying issues, like tension between the couple or awkward interactions. Reflect on any signs of discomfort or discord during key moments like the vows or reception. | After the ceremony, she walked back down the aisle (outdoor wedding) and then just...kept walking...over the hill, hopped the fence, and got in a waiting pickup truck. We literally had no idea where she had gone for like 2 hours then she showed up AFTER they cut the cake at the reception without herü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èthey separated a year later (couldn't believe they didn't annul the whole thing) | He playfully shoved cake in her face so she threw the cake and cried.¬† They lasted a couple years | Ah heteronormativity | As she started walking down the aisle ‚Ä¶ walking towards me, standing at the front with the minister. | When the bride walked down the aisle covered in hives. They were poking through the tattoo level makeup. | Pretty much every wedding. I always put a bet down on how soon they will split up.

Usually I win

They say it's around 50%, but for my earnings it's a little bit higher. Like 75%

Edit: I love how I'm getting down voted for this. Sorry buddy, but if I'm putting cash down on your relationship, chances are not going to work out. Thank you for my $200 | I've never thought like this | It's a nice day for a white wedding | There was an episode of Nurse Jackie that was kind of like that. Lots of screaming over you invited your drug dealer to my wedding?! I guess it's a good way to know you have a problem. | Even if you have a coke problem, it's like... just buy the coke lol. You don't need to invite the dude. | Hey, your coke dealer is always their for you. | ""Honey, when you said you wanted a Snow White themed wedding, I thought you meant the fairy tale."" | Ha, I remember seeing adults doing coke at a wedding when I was 13 and thinking it wouldn‚Äôt last, that was correct | I read that as cake dealer at first lol | He aspired to have a great future together, but she aspired to other things. |  That's not something to sniff at | The old ""Sharon Stone in Casino"" wedding.  And even she just called him from the wedding. | Man that reminds me of one I went to. Girl was 24 and husband was 38. They‚Äôd been together 5 years.

We thought it was kinda creepy at first but they seemed to be happy. At the wedding, her younger sister who was 17 and was just about to go to college gave a toast about how she wished she could have a relationship like theirs and a husband like him ‚Äúwhen she grows up.‚Äù

Husband had known this girl since she was 12.

Anyway, long story short he did a nice slow dance with her‚Ä¶then another, and another, and was ignoring his wife and everyone else. At one point I looked over and he‚Äôs got his hand inside the back of her lowcut bridesmaid dress and is rubbing her ass. She‚Äôs got her eyes closed and her face is buried in his neck. 

People had tried to break them up, to say something, people started leaving the wedding. Bride is crying outside. Her parents are furious. 

Anyway, they got the marriage annulled and he dated her sister. Whole family went no contact with the sister. She dropped out of college to stay in town and work and live with him. He was with her for a while then dumped her for another high school girl a few years later. 

Last I heard he had been arrested and charged with statutory rape but somehow got it dismissed, then moved to Alaska to do‚Ä¶whatever. | >And she kept all the presents!

God what a bitch | This is pretty much how Jerry Seinfeld and his wife got together. He was the ""gym friend"" she told her fiance not to worry about. Left him for Jerry immediately after the honeymoon. | Holy shit.  Similar story; grabbing the ass of a bridesmaid was a pretty big giveaway.  This wasn't just a quick little squeeze.  Dude got a whole cheek and shook it.

They lasted 15 months which is 14 more months than I was expecting. | I knew a couple like this. She just wanted the honeymoon vacation time away from work. He had no clue until she told him goodbye the day they got home. She‚Äôs now working on her 4th divorce and he‚Äôs been happily married for 20 years. |  Sounds like that wedding was a train wreck from the start. It's wild how people can be so casual about their relationships, especially in front of family and friends. There's definitely a pattern with these crazy stories, but at the same time, it's a reminder about trust and communication. | The utter gall of some people. | r/foundsatan | I hate The Drake. | Other than the presents, why even get married? | Why do people even think of marriage when¬†they know they're going to be unfaithful anyway?¬†
Cheating is bad enough but it's even more disgusting you can't even behave yourself out of respect for your SO and both families and guests at your own wedding.¬†
She sounds like one of those devious people who like doing things on a whim for the thrill and then move on to the next new thing when she gets tired of it.¬†
He didn't just dodged a bullet, he dodged a firing squad! | Howd that work out for her? | I don't understand, is it a sad or happy ending? | Poor Alan Turing was very close to marrying a woman who worked with him. Watching her interview was touching as they were best friends. They backed out of the engagement because he confessed to her he had no attraction to women - even one he loved like her.

Watching her talk about him in those interviews you saw her face light up brightly. She talked about how handsome, sweet, and caring he was... You can see she still loved him long after his tragic end. | One of my coworkers is in the middle of this right now, but still in denial. They‚Äôve been married for probably 3 years now, but I‚Äôm (almost) positive he‚Äôs going to come out. They‚Äôre both deconstructing from religion, so I imagine it‚Äôll come shortly. I feel bad for both of them! | I simply don't understand why this shit still happens in modern times. Like, I'd rather spend the rest of my life as a celibate hermit in a mystical mountain cave before I'd ever consider having a relationship with much less get married to a woman. Monkey bars are straight, I however am NOT. | Very common in very religious cultures where so much pressure is put on people to get married and have kids, and you are a social pariah if you don‚Äôt ever get married.¬†¬†

I remember meeting the guy my Mormon friend was engaged to and knowing he was gay within 10 seconds of talking to him.¬†They got married, she got pregnant almost immediately, he left her about a month after getting pregnant¬†and has never met his child. It was completely devastating for her.¬† ¬†

My mom‚Äôs cousin had a similar situation except she raised 4 kids with the guy. When their youngest was a tween the husband said he couldn‚Äôt do it anymore and had never been attracted to her, even though he loved her as a best friend. She found out during their divorce that before their wedding, his Mormon bishop knew all about it but had advised him to just get married and his ‚Äúperverse attractions‚Äù would go away. They obviously didn‚Äôt and a family of 6 was broken up.¬† | Tale as old as time | That's actually really sad for both. | This is how I feel about Gino and Jasmine on 90 Day Fiance. Your marriage isn't working because.he's.GAY. | I was at that wedding. | My own mother went through this in the late 1940s. She was a teenager and quite naive. During the war she fell in love with a serving pilot who was in his late 20s and seemed to be a really nice man. 

They married at the end of WW2. Her new husband was gay and trying to hide it. They never had sex and, after a while, he started meeting men on the side. It was a heartbreaking experience for my mother and she ended up divorced in the early 1950s (My father was her 2nd husband who she met several years after the divorce). | Sounds like a couple that met at Christian college. | Classic case of fruit blindness. | We know very similar people. | Who are these people who have this much sex?? ü§£

Goddamn the life of a hot person must be wild. I'm struggling with dating and there are people with fiances _and_ side pieces, like wth. | Did you tell the groom right after she said that | Where do people find this sort of losers and still marry them??? | WHAT WOMAN SEES THIS BEHAVIOR IN A MAN AND MARRIES HIM ANYWAY? | Man, I got into a bar fight a week before my wedding. Didn't get arrested, but I did have a black eye and a chipped tooth.

I was 23 and very drunk. She was none too happy, but we managed. Just had our 15th anniversary last month. | What gets me is the *trying to get pragent* part.. like, what the actual, whole, and entire fuck. | ‚ÄúWe wanted a small and inmate wedding, just went down to the courthouse together‚Äù | The heart wants what it wants: pizza | I may be tired, but I seriously sat here for a minute trying to figure out if ""ate her special gluten-free lunch while setting up"" was some innuendo for oral sex I had never heard. It finally dawned on me that it made more sense to take it literally. üòÜ | So wait, she didn't want to eat cake because she required gluten-free, but her new husband shoved it in her face? It was already fucked up but if it wasn't a gluten-free cake, that's even worse... | I feel like I read her AITAH post about it too lol | >ate her special gluten-free lunch while setting up for the ceremony and he didn't say anything about it

Is that a euphemism or something? | Wow how rapey | [deleted] | Hey, when you've got a routine that works, why change?  ü§£ | Something old, something new.. | Everything about it was her dream wedding except the groom I suppose | Was she working on a punch card? Nine weddings at the venue and the tenth one is free? | The scientific method does tell us we should only change one variable at a time in order for it to be a sound experiment. It sounds like she knew what she was doing | Could probably have done the wedding blindfolded cuz she's got the directory memorized | Did she remember to bring the club card and get it stamped?  5th wedding is free! | 'Good evening everyone. Good to see some new faces ..... and quite a few familiar ones."" | She must have got a 3 for 2 coupon | Reduce, reuse, recycle | Did she get kick back from the venue, like if your marriage does work out for the next year we will refund your money | Divorces or ‚Äúmysterious disappearances ‚Äú? | Did she happen to be in the bathroom opening her cards to take out cash so she could buy herself drinks from the cash bar?!?!?! | Soooooo essentially he punched her and there happened to be cake on/in his hand. GEEZus | I've heard that there is supposedly a correlation between weddings where the groom shoves the cake into the bride's face and divorce in general but geeze | I came here to say cake face smash by a groom, but there was no blood or broken bones, just a woman sad and crying on her wedding day. Your example is next level! | Did they get divorced or did he kill her? | It was a reception cake-smash on a Saturday.
Bride had a divorce attorney Monday. | Just in case anyone here is thinking of trying this hilarious jape - be aware that tiered cakes frequently have wooden rods in them to stabilise the tiers. Shoving someone‚Äôs face into a tiered cake comes with the very real risk of shoving their face into the wooden rod and potentially doing serious damage such as poking out an eye. 

Just don‚Äôt do it. It‚Äôs not funny. If you are really that resentful about getting married that you feel the need to assault your bride in front of the entire wedding then DON‚ÄôT GET FUCKING MARRIED. | Good for the groom's father. I'm hoping they annulled the marriage immediately.. | The suppressed rage his behavior shows. Oof. | That dude was absolutely not ready to be married. That's a ""my life is over so I'm taking it out on you immediately"" move. | I would have beat the shit out of him myself. | That's DV | I‚Äôm genuinely curious what the divorce rate of cake face smash couples are. I assume it‚Äôs higher than non-cake face smash couples, but what‚Äôs the rate exactly? 50%? Higher? | So he punched her, and just happened to have cake in his fist. | Excuse me wtf üôÉ he‚Äôs way out of line | Did he cover his hand in cake and just clock her or something? What an idiot... | Holy shit. | What the fuck | What was the guy trying to achieve? | I was a banquet server in college and have attended my share of weddings, and I have never seen cake-shoving.  I have known a few people who experienced it, and they all got divorced after years of misery. | I feel like I‚Äôve read this comment before. Have you told it elsewhere? | I don‚Äôt even know them and I would have joined in that beating.  That poor woman. | Sounds like a family baptism in my town. | > When the groom shoved wedding cake into his new bride's mouth so hard that it chipped a tooth,

Literally how, what the fuck was in that cake? | I've heard you tell this story before! | Oh dear God üòÇüòÇüòÇ | Assault with a deadly cake. | Oh the poor thing ! ¬†( bride not the asshat) | We did this at our wedding, both trying to get each other, it was cute and fun. I don't know wtf this was. | Wow, sounds like there was some suppressed anger...

EDIT:  Sorry, I was joking, but I didn't mean anything other than how could a person, the person you supposedly are wanting to share their life with, to have them effectively shove something in their mouth so hard as to break a tooth and bloody their lip, and make them fall breaking their wrist. 

This was done in all good fun?  A hilarious wedding ritual?   Guess I'm old fashioned, and would settle for smearing a dab of icing on my wife's nose. | I'm going to hell for laughing at this | Holy shit I‚Äôm laughing so hard at picturing this. ¬†¬† | I mean I'd go home too. A local motel sounds boring as shit but I don't live with my parents and I've had sex with my girlfriend. | Motel? lol | Perhaps she was unaware that they'd already had sex | LMAO. | I dunno, this is kind of a green flag for me. They both enjoy being around family. | Poor Rhaenerya. | I don‚Äôt even CARE if this one is true! I haven‚Äôt stopped laughing while trying to visualize the scene. 

Holy fucking cow! I think I‚Äôm gonna be dead in a minute. | Wow a rare use of the original intended purpose for ‚Äúspeak now or forever hold your peace‚Äù | Whoa. | I feel like you don‚Äôt even have to mention the first three‚Ä¶ | Holy shit | The last one... Holy hell. That is so outlandish I cannot believe it is real | I had a similar one but they were my and each others cousins. That part of the family isn‚Äôt close so they didn‚Äôt figure it out til the rehearsal dinner when the families met‚Ä¶they still got married. They divorced a few years later, it was very weird. | This was a fucking rollercoaster and the ending was wild. Imagine some random douchebag at your wedding announces to the entire world that you‚Äôve been giving you half-sister the pipe for however long it took them to want to marry. | Wait elaborate you can‚Äôt leave us hanging!

They stopped the ceremony? What about the reception? Obviously they didn‚Äôt have results that same day‚Ä¶ Everything was halted, in chaos and everyone went home to wait for tests to be done?! MORE DEETS! | I‚Äôve always been terrified of that last one. üòÖ My dad dipped when I was little so I‚Äôve always dated people from different area codes who were from families of a different ethnicity. So far, so good. (I mean, not all of the men were good but, they def weren‚Äôt related to me either sooooo it‚Äôs halfway good. üòÖ) The advent of 23&Me was made for moments like this.

I love that they were able to make the most of it, though, and maintain a close relationship. | That actually went about as well as it possibly could. Huh. | Roll tide? | Genetic sexual attraction is a thing | I wonder if they did ""it"" before the wedding. | Did a smartass doctor with a cane and a penchant for pills make any snide remarks and smirk? | you win | I shall just leave this here 
https://youtu.be/a4o_rXLC4zU?si=uYqVjBJirK5nmwzL | Ireland? I‚Äôm getting Ireland vibes. | Okay this is the best story on here, big kudos to you for sharing | How is this not number one hahahaha¬† | There‚Äôs a reason they‚Äôre at each other‚Äôs family get-togethers‚Ä¶. | ""What are you doing, half-brother?"" | Even though they were estranged at least he saved his daughter from having relations with her half-sibling. | Shame and scandal in the family üé∂ | Wow. The last story is next level! | Whut | wtf that‚Äôs a new kind of daddy issue | Sad for your cousin, but thank gawd he‚Äôs not like her father. That‚Äôs tacky af | Yikes, she had some creepy Daddy issues. | I get its sunk cost, but floored at the expense of a 300 person wedding and giving up just months later.  Maybe spend an ounce on counseling? | Husband got‚Ä¶..
    
Cock blocked | >He did come back for his belongings a few months later

Wow that shit would have been on the curb within milliseconds of him leaving to live in another state if that happened to me | ""She was never the same after that"" is really serving a Miss Havisham vibe. The whole set-up is so crushing...the hype, the expense, all expected the social and familial validation. | Once someone, you love, embarrasses you in front of your family and friends, it‚Äôs something you never forget. | > She was never the same after that. 

Damn, that‚Äôs so sad | Wait what | Yeah, I had a brother like that, he‚Äôs been cut off for years now | So is your husband actually a loser? Did he ever amount to anything? You can't just stop at the surprise reveal! | Wow! My mother in law didn‚Äôt offer to buy a lap dance, but she did tell 6-months pregnant me a week before the wedding that her son was a loser and to not marry him. 25 years later, still married to the ‚Äúloser‚Äù and she‚Äôs still a manipulative bitch with a shriveled up hateful heart‚Ä¶ | Lmaoooo well played | Your story is like a shitty morph. Well written, well played. | Plot twist! | Not gonna lie, you had me in the first half | If it's not too invasive on your part but could you elaborate on this story? I'm not sure what a good subreddit might be but just from that little snippet it sounds wild | Sounds like a horrible family, but a great guy. | I too have toxic inlaws. | What a twist! | üòßüò© | Sounds like the understanding was ""Don't ask, don't tell: don't ask if I'm cheating on you, because I don't want to tell you that I am!"" | Ugh, until cunts like this sleep with me and I have to have the ""Either you tell him or I will"" talk and watch them fucking melt down into the pieces of shit they are.  I hate finding out I'm an accomplice to cheating, but I will gladly fuck up someones life to set shit straight too. | Everyone knows you need to secure your drugs the day before the wedding! | You should see if you can hook this girl up with /u/lefthandbunny 's ex. | see, the bride in the other comment who invited her dealer knows what's up and is proactive. maybe not the best spouse but for sure up for wedding planning¬† | Weddings are exhausting. I get it. | Where's John Goodman when you need him. | I guess that‚Äôs why some people get a wedding planner. | Was his name ‚ÄúGlen Gulia‚Äù? | I know of course this can't apply to all sports fans, but what's the deal with so many of them being immensely tacky like this? I once had a date that kept asking to reschedule, and the final nail in the coffin for me was when he tried to reschedule again on my birthday because it was Super Bowl Sunday. Mind you, it was a date HE arranged. I was angry about that, but I can't imagine dealing with this on my freaking ***wedding*** day. | My wife and I wanted a fall wedding but we're told in explicit terms that if it was in football or deer season half the family WOULD NOT be there.

We should have taken them up on that threat. | >""You know I love you, baby, but I've got 10 bucks on the game.""

Jesus, was she marrying Al Bundy? | Why was the wedding on a Superbowl Sunday? That's just bad planning | For the fucking life of me I'll never understand how men like this attract a partner let alone end up married. | ‚ú®*SWOON* ‚ú® | If someone was that invested into NFL, why on earth would they agree to have a wedding on Superbowl Sunday? | All that for only $10 bucks wow | A shut up ring is typically a bad sign... but $10 on the Super Bowl? He ditched the reception for *$10?* | So did you go? | You should have gone, then had the groom come in 15 seconds later (exposing her before you got involved.) Then watch the catastrophe unfold. | There's a porn studio readying a DMCA strike against you for this plagiarism. | This happened to me at my friends wedding but it was to do coke. Reading your comment, at first I was like ‚Äúhmmm I see no problems here‚Äù | How long did you last? | It's just a jump to the left...and out the door. | Man I‚Äôd be delighted if my spouse did that for my wedding | Huh, that sounds fun to me.  I would have gotten a kick out of that if my partner did that and I find that movie...odd.  Rehearsed and unexpected dances are so fun. | We met at a post-Rocky party and were in cast together. You bet your bippy we did the Time Warp at our reception!¬† | In lingerie? | üòÜ ü§£ üòÇ | The groom and groomsmen sound like fun people | That sounds amazing! | She sounds like an ass. I make a point of making my wife laugh at least once a day. 

Even if I have to just drop my pants. | Gosh, that makes me so sad | There‚Äôs a neat stat that the more expensive wedding in relation to your income the more likely you are to divorce. | Ugh. | My friend is still in serious debt from his wedding. It was about 7 years ago and they divorced 6 years ago. And he can‚Äôt just file bankruptcy because he‚Äôd lose his security clearance. | So he spent close to or more than his annual income on a wedding? Got damn | I joked about having a divided attention because a UFC event was the same night I was getting married. 

It‚Äôs been 11 years and I barely remember who was on the card, as no one bothered watching while at the reception.

Had a great dinner and dance with my wife though üòä

Here‚Äôs to hoping you find someone who knows what lasts and what‚Äôs fleeting. | Wow......just wow. | My spouse and I literally eloped because our would-be wedding fell during football and basketball season, our 2 favorite things, respectively. Neither of us could be bothered to plan or host a wedding so we didn't. To me, it's not even about ""the thing,"" but if you're aligned and on the same page. I'm glad you guys split up if his priorities didn't mesh with yours! | I may or may not have put the Packers game on during my reception.  In my defense, it was the playoffs... | F that guy. You made the right decision to leave him and you should be proud of doing so. | I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that, but you absolutely did the right thing. It must have been hard to stay with him for an extra year after your wedding, but I completely understand why you waited. | A truly awful man to offer hard drugs to someone during eh most precious part of pregnancy | I don't understand how you get to the point where you marry a dude who is a huge coke addict and have a baby with him. How is this not entirely on you? | Nothing but class‚Ä¶ | This really needs to be higher. Concise and awesome. | There is a bigger story here and I want to hear it | a remote marriage if you will | You know Lucas Hernandez? | He reused the cake topper?? | subtly and low-key absolutely buck wild, how did that happen, did the groom order the cake himself, who did this and what kind of outcome were they going for | Reused the cake topper from his first wedding. This one is actually insane. | ??? You HAVE to be making this up! No fucking wayyy | Or just their mutual stubbornness. I always stayed too long in horrible relationships if someone insisted it wouldn't last, when I was young and stupid. | Ugh, I've been to a wedding like that. I guess you have to laugh about it and enjoy the catering because what else can you do? | The bride and groom¬†started a secret betting pool, and bet anonymously. The entire wedding was a facade for a get rich quick scheme. | Sounds like my wedding!  

43 years later, we're still having the last laugh.  üòä | what was the closest guess? a week? | Thank makes total sense to me. It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúDo you have respect for your partner?‚Äù | I asked my husband to please not smash cake in my face. I‚Äôm glad I married someone who respected my wishes | Told my fiance like 30 times not to put cake on my face. She did it anyways. The disrespect went downhill from there, culminating in catching her cheating multiple times. | What if they didn‚Äôt feed each other cake and just ate their own pieces of cake like normal people? | Makes sense. My husband and I respectfully fed each other the cake. We‚Äôre happily still married with a 10 month old. | Me and my husband smashed cake, my favorite pictures were of that. | Wife and I were #3, no shoving. Still going 12 years and two kids later. üëç | My husband and i gently smooshed a little, just enough to get it on our noses or whatever. We both laughed, but again, the important part was we agreed we'd do it. And trusted each other not to be total dicks. | I told her not to, smashed my nose and glasses and i almost punched her and it took a month to get all the icing out of my sinuses.       
And she's still annoying and doesn't listen something over 30 years later. | And if they didn't bother with the cake? | It sounds like divorce was part of their plan. So I guess this worked out for them. | I mean it sounds like they knew what they were doing so... | My best friend and I used to joke about going to Vegas and getting married by Elvis, just so that I could eventually be a 40 year old divorced guy instead of a 40 year old single guy. We didn't end up getting married by Elvis, but we're approaching our 11 year anniversary. | Oh god. I‚Äôm not going to lie, this was my exact thought process when I lost my virginity and I don‚Äôt regret my first time but I guess it would have been nice to put a little more thought into it. There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm doing the same for my first husband lol | I had this plan with a friend of mine.

At 14 it makes sense | Pardon my stupidity, but what does that mean? | What started the fight? | that‚Äôs so punk rock | I was strongly tempted at several points, especially by the family members with cameras who felt it was more.important to record the event than be there for it.   We didn't even get most of the pictures. | Was their last name Palin?  üòè | Oof. Sorry to hear that, bud | Those poor children having a chaotic family life and a mum who refuses to try for them‚Ä¶ | How did she not go to prison? Lol | I only dated one, thankfully, like this. She claimed her meds got changed. I wondered if she stopped taking them. She went from being fine to a F5 holy shitnado in the matter of weeks. I was getting ready to get out when she broke up. Needless to say, my dog and I had a nice quiet night, drink and cigar for the first time in about a month at that point. | Idk why but I‚Äôm rolling on the floor laughing about the intrusive thoughts with the meat hammer | This was a bummer to read. But, like‚Ä¶how hot?! | The sex was probably unreal. | That last bit was the part I was looking for | Nobody knows where my Johnny has gone, but Judy left the same time‚Ä¶ | I just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt understand dudes who do this shit. Don‚Äôt think I ever will. | Hopefully the wedding certificate wasn't turned on by that point! | Why doesn‚Äôt your sister want to see you or the family? | I really want to know if your cousin and this man  are atill together? | No wonder it‚Äôs bad luck to see the bride in her dress too soon | It's on thing to cheat or be the other person but with FAMILY. | Roll tide. | I mean they had the husband in the way so it was already a complicated start. | I actually had a friend say this at his own wedding as the groom. During the reception someone asked how he felt now and he said, eh, it's exactly the same, just now if we want to split we gotta get the law involved. ü§£ | > she said ""it still feels like at anytime I can leave if I want""

was she wrong tho | Maybe I‚Äôm a red flag, I see nothing wrong with this answer lol. I‚Äôm getting married this Saturday‚Ä¶ | Wait, so is that your brother? Or is the SIL through your spouse‚Äôs side? Either way, what a tool. That‚Äôs such a rotten-to-the-core thing to do to someone | Ha, my husband and I will get cheeky sometimes. He will introduce me as his trophy wife and I will introduce him as my first husband. We do it totally in a serious manner then wait to see people process the information. Most people laugh, occasionally we get someone where it just goes over their head. | Must‚Äôve been *some* honeymoon‚Ä¶ sheesh! | That‚Äôs why I like reading them, I don‚Äôt want to be involved but just want the deets | Your avatar icon is mean. | Whenever I feel bad about an issue in my marriage I come to Reddit and read about how terrible it can get and I realize that my marriage is amazing lol | These comments make me thank my lucky stars that my in laws are relatively normal people | These comments made me realize perhaps it might have been a good thing that I am unmarried | A lot of the parent threads really make me appreciate my folks so I get what you mean. | These comments make me realize I am so damn glad I never got married. | Right? Man was my wedding amazing. | These comments make me happily single! | These comments are making me depressed | Good to hear; we need more happy stories. | Username checks out | Same bro. Same. | Blink twice if she‚Äôs reading your post over your shoulder | If you think that she's cheating on you | I generally agree with this, but one exception is where someone is shy and not really comfortable with being the centre of attention | Exactly! Smiles don't lie. I can tell when I see the photos. | My wife and I had a super simple wedding. She wore a dress that only went down to her knees, she wore cowboy boots, her hair was nice, but not over the top, her flowers were some tulips that she got in the morning from our local grocery store, and she doesn‚Äôt really wear makeup and so she didn‚Äôt wear any makeup for our wedding. 

It was beautiful and so special to see her walking down the aisle as who she really was. 

We‚Äôve been married 6 months and it‚Äôs been the greatest time of my life. | Yeesh. What a piece of work | I‚Äôve seen those same ‚ÄúWelcome to [brides] Wedding!‚Äù ‚Äú(‚Ä¶.featuring [groom])‚Äù signs! So cringey!!! | someone I went to High school with recently posted an instagram story with this exact type of sign. These people just want to have a wedding, not actually be married | Was it? | That‚Äôs like something you‚Äôd see in a sitcom | Everything about this is so gross | I‚Äôve seen this at friends weddings recently and just don‚Äôt get it! Such an awful and tacky sign | Shit like this is why I never want to get married. It's so obvious that the bride just wants a wedding to show off and not actual love. | My last girlfriend‚Ä¶ if I hadn‚Äôt gotten out, the ring would probably be happening right about now. She was just so mean to everyone. And she did make me more assertive in some things. But man, how she talked to me. Finally learned she thought being kind was a weakness! No ma‚Äôam, I‚Äôm gone. 

Also a big thing to realize: when you have the realization you‚Äôre going to be THAT guy at your wedding that your friends are likely saying, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs marring her? She really sucks‚Äù - eye opener to learn | I have a theory that the more lavish and elaborate the wedding is, the lower the chances of staying married are. 

Example: I was poor and my wife was poor so the family put together the best they could do themselves. 

Meanwhile my wife‚Äôs sister married a pompous type and had a very expensive wedding. This was the type of selfish man who went to a football game the same day his kid was born. 

Long story short, they divorced when she had enough of him and found someone else. 

My wife and I will hit our 31st anniversary in October. | The first part where the couple is putting every symbolic wedding ritual into the ceremony would be hilarious if they're both happy. Like it'd be an insufferable service but hey it's their happy day! They're *that* couple, but they're happy together.¬† | I hate unity candles. As they light what is basically a phallic object, it's like asking everyone to watch on the wedding night. | We told the priest during our pre wedding plans that the words obey, submit etc were NOT to be used in our vows. If he tried to use them I would not answer.

Priest thought we were joking at first. We said no, we are partners, there is no ""head of household"" or ""obeying "" in our lives.

He said ok.

I also kept my maiden name. I'm just a crazy liberal gen xer. But also married 34 years so maybe we are doing something right. | Funny. The one where the pastor was bringing up issues the couple discussed in marriage counseling was the marriage I thought would last longest. They are at about 30 years.

That pastor was a tool, though. | > I said I always thought she was going to be my sister in law. She said she thought so too, but **no one stopped the wedding**.


Wait, what? | How did you get an invite to that wedding?! | ""I met her outside of a Walmart a few years later and she was pregnant.""

Cliff Notes for the story | As long as the cake was good, that‚Äôs all that matters. Sounds like the tea was pretty good, too | What a ride! Great story, well told and hilarious +1 | At least the cake was good though | Why would you go to your brother's ex Wedding? | Reminds me of a nightmare wedding. Both the bride and groom were divorced after a very expensive wedding and both were still in debt from it. So they agreed that they'd make their ceremony as frugal as possible. Which I thought was a very wise choice... Unfortunately, they went incredibly overboard with it lol

They had these little placards everywhere that described how much money they saved by doing xyz. And they had this big blow up poster of the statistic that the cost of a wedding directly correlates with the probability of divorce. To do a real-life proof of that stat, they wanted all the married guests to write how much they spent on their wedding and if they ended up getting divorced lol. It was so unhinged and everyone was so uncomfortable | I went to a wedding where the bride didn't crack a smile the entire ceremony and looked pretty unenthused for the reception. Meanwhile the groom's brother got blind drunk and caused a scene later in the evening. I think that marriage was done within 12 months. | Exactly why I never want to get married. | The father of the groom said to me when leaving, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you the next time he gets married.‚Äù | Bruh üò≠ | Was that his first exposure to that type of food?? What a fucking loser‚Ä¶ | Ouch | Wha‚Ä¶ *how* does that even *work??* | I have never understood why you would do this to someone you supposedly love and respect. | This was the day I learned people even think of this tradition as cake-SMASHING. WTELF? My husband and I gently FED each other the first piece of cake. Because...we like each other and that's why we were getting married. Why is this such a foreign concept suddenly? Wow. Anyway, we're still married 20 yrs later and he just served me the most amazing dinner he made for me and our kids. 'Cause he's a good, loving human. | Yep, I went to one of these too. | I wish I could go back in time, find the first 50 or so people who did this, and dissuade them from doing it one scalp at a time. 

Or just, like, punch them in their throats. It doesn‚Äôt have to be as dramatic as my Vengeance Brain says it should be lol | Wow.  That's amazingly bad. | Poor gal didn't realize she can just buy flowers any ol time! Kept having weddings just to get fancy flowers! | Sounds like my 1st wedding! | I guess the mother-in-law was hoping to score | It‚Äôs supposed to be 7.  Seven wives for seven brothers. | was the younger one forced to marry?¬† why was she crying?¬† | Indian family? Or Arab? | I am Canadian, and for the longest time thought that the left ring finger was the ONLY finger a wedding ring would go on. I didn‚Äôt even think that other cultures would do it differently. And then I did a semester abroad in Norway in my early 20‚Äôs and realized that a lot of Europe, the ring finger is actually on the right hand. 

I‚Äôm glad that, my now Fiance, and I, both agree that the left ring finger is where it‚Äôs at (at least for us üòÇ) | I just got married last Sunday and my fiance and I actually messed up the hand the rings are on - he handed me his right hand so I put it on unthinkingly until one of his groomsmen blurted out, ""WRONG HAND."" It got a giant laugh from all of us and it makes me sad that this couple already started their marriage fighting. | I put the ring on my husbands right hand. He just rolled with it and moved it to the left hand afterwards. You know like a reasonable person. Recognizing that I was probably nervous.

We still laugh about it 34 years later. He insists we aren't married because the ring was put on the wrong hand. I say I have a signed marriage license that says otherwise. | In Germany the wedding ring goes on the right finger. My husband and I wear our rings on the left finger because you now ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre right handed and the ring just interferes with the usage of a pc mouse. My Grandma (polish) always complaints about it because in Poland (and I think in other countries in Europe as well) you wear the wedding ring on the left finger when you are widowed.¬† | Usually the goldsmith asks about that before they make the rings. Did the bride and groom purchase their rings from a gumball machine? | My reception was in an elks lodge. We were so poor lmao

My wife wasn't flashing beav, though. It was such a low budget affair and only trashy because that's all we could afford. We even had the elks club cater the reception - pizza and wings and open bar(in wisconsin, largest expense of our wedding).

Funnily, most of my friends and family say they had more fun at my wedding than at some of the stodgier weddings they've been at.

Nobody thought we would last either, but here we are a dozen years and 3 kids later. My wife is my best friend and it only grows for me. | Well often times the groomsmen would do this without the grooms knowledge. Its a really old prank. | That really is supposed to be taken as a joke though. | I went to school with a couple who got married junior year of HS (1975)

They are still together. 

I married my late wife after being together 8 months.
(1979)
We were together 34 years.

People gave us the classic 6 months. | Military brat of a military brat here. One of my Aunts eloped from West Germany to the US when she was 16 to marry my CSM grandfather‚Äôs 20 year old driver. They‚Äôve been married 52 years now. Hoo boy! I‚Äôm sure it was quite a family scandal back in the day, though!! | All the people I know who got married at eighteen are all still married. The people I know who ping pong between marriages all got married late and got used to being independent. | Glad you finally did :) | No need for satire. I wish my dad would have divorced my step mom years ago when he asked me if he should. He didn‚Äôt, he‚Äôs still miserable but happily miserable now that the youngest kid is almost out of the house. | I Ross, take Rachel. | I had some childhood friends who had a long on and off again relationship and then decided to marry.  She was obsessed with money. She slipped up in the vows and said ""til debt do we part"".  For years she insisted that every single person in attendance misheard her. | I just experienced this at a recent wedding. She said, ‚ÄúFor RICHER!!! or poorer.‚Äù Was pretty nauseating. Will be interesting to see if the marriage lasts. That‚Äôs just one of many reasons I think it won‚Äôt. | What a stupid ‚Äújoke‚Äù | My ex wife smashed me when we had about thirty conversations about how I really, really didn‚Äôt want her to do it. Kinda set the tone for the whole marriage. | Sorry that happened but you handled it wonderfully...also great screen name! | This would really get me heated ngl. Most I'd just walk away and say fuck it, but this might get under my skin. I don't know why. | I feel like if anyone had to do it, it should have been the wedding party to say something!! | Username raises further questions‚Ä¶ | I like this one | I feel like there's a nice middle ground somewhere out there... | Next one? 

My BIL, who I'm convinced is somewhere on the spectrum, married a total See You Next Tuesday, a term I don't use lightly. She was consistently rude my to my wife's family, rude to my BIL, and rude to his friends. She just gave off a touch-me-not vibe that told me that her marriage to my BIL wouldn't last. So, as a groomsman, I remember standing up on the altar thinking 'train wreck, train wreck, train wreck.'

As it turns out, when he met her the first time at a gym, she had been thrown out of her house by her husband for cheating. She conveniently didn't tell my BIL that she was still married and moved in with him. They stayed married for a year until he paid off her credit cards. Then she cheated on him and gave him herpes.

When I had a conversation with her sisters at the wedding, even they were trashing her. | You handled all of that much better than us ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù folk would.


(To be clear, I‚Äôm only calling myself ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù bc I don‚Äôt live in Alabama and I‚Äôm piggybacking off their assumptions/your jokes. That ‚Äúsecond pair of shoes‚Äù line would‚Äôve had me guffawing) | I swear this is what ed sheeran wrote ""Beautiful people"" about, was he at the wedding???? | Kristie alley!? | I at first thought maybe we knew each other.

But they made it like 8 months after the fight in my case. Quite impressive, all things considered. | What were they even fighting about?? | Wait was this Trumps first or second marriage? | >My long time crush / best friend was getting married.¬†



Oh boy. One of *these.* Did you shoot your shot once¬†he was gone or did you keep pretending you were her ""friend?"" | Well that was certainly a ride. | Was her name Purrsephone? | Happy ending, at least. | So she had her happily ever after | Sounds like she has a fulfilling life as a Reddit Mod now. | Was her first husband JD Vance? | Please tell me you're a dude, that would make it even better | Yeah -- that's kind of a big hint.  Wow. | YIKES | GEEZus! What a freaking spectacle‚Ä¶ | As in, they wanted you to unicorn and they thought inviting you to a family only wedding was a good way to make that happen? :D | I agree. I live in Florida and it‚Äôs shocking how many couples get married at Disney World or have Disney weddings. I just don‚Äôt get it. | At least she got along with the in-laws | Ewww. | Ahh yes, the traditional bride's lapdance for her new husband's dad. | WHAT

Where was the sword stored? Like I assume he didn't wear it on his belt through the whole ceremony? Did he pull it out from under a table? | While she was preparing for the wedding, he studied the blade. | I mean, in his defense, identical twins can be tricky especially if they are wearing the same dress. | It‚Äôs stories like this that make me question if some men even ask for the daughter‚Äôs hand in marriage anymore. Is that not a thing anymore because where I live if someone didn‚Äôt do that and they just showed up engaged. Hell would break loose in the county. | Yay for that family member standing up against her üí™ | Did you? | Can we get some more context? Oh my | Nice | More details on this one please | Theoretically that could be a great sign, theoretically. | Panic at the disco ü™© I write sins not tragedies | Weddings when the couple is already married aren't the same. Like the reception I get, it's fun to do that part. But having the ceremony again is a bit fake. My cousin had one of those. They got married privately when the timing was right but then had an extravagant destination wedding. To each their own though. They were happy and they are still married | What's a grand March? I haven't heard that tradition before? | Gross. Equal douchebaggery from all his bros, too | Yeah, dude. She just sounds toxic all-around | I, ah, don't think you were friends then, either. | Smart one. | My parents got legitimately married for tax and heritage reasons xD. They where at the bank finalizing the credit for the house and the guy there was like wait, you have 3 kids, are buying a house together and aren‚Äôt married? Are you stupid? | Wait, what? Who was rude to whom? Who couldn‚Äôt hang out with anyone? The bride left drunk after? I‚Äôm confused - I think I‚Äôm missing a person here | This happened at a wedding I was at recently. But I think she just got shy. At least I hope so: I know the groom well, and it would tear him apart if his marriage failed. | Thats so sad üòû | The fuck you is to the girl, not the abusive boss? | Oh my life it‚Äôs too late for me to be reading this‚Ä¶full belly laugh ü§£ü§£ü§£ | I‚Äôd say that it was ‚Äú4th wife‚Äù¬† | I‚Äôd say that it was ‚Äú4th wife‚Äù¬† | Bro I feel ya. Cousins wedding and reception was a cluster but the bride had two speeches for her, groom got one, all three barely mentioned the groom. I volunteered to say some words, got shot down hard. Stung and stunk! They‚Äôre still together, we‚Äôll see how long, its only been 2 years. | Is it for us or the audience? | Wait how long did they last though? | Did you hear them fighting or something? | That doesn‚Äôt actually tell us what happened. | Whut. Why, though? | So this all worked out in the end? Great for you! Remarried? Single? How you doin‚Äô these days? | You tried the cake smash without talking about it first? Bruh, that's like admitting you're the problem... | Scotty didn‚Äôt know! | That's either an acceptable kink or insanely disrespectful. | Can you write that again, but in a way that makes sense? | I don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre saying‚Ä¶ | Info: did you feel especially passionate about driving? Or was it just her who felt that way? | ... what | Huh? | Kids are cute but they are WORK. I was a nanny for a long time and it was by far the most exhausting job I ever had. I can‚Äôt imagine being a parent 24/7 without ever being allowed a break. | Sounds autistic.

And no, that isn't an insult. As an autistic person, I can see that I could do that because of overwhelm. | Aww I‚Äôm so sorry. This breaks my heart. | Why get married | >why the hell would you get married if you have been cheating BEFORE the wedding

My cousin did exactly that. I wasn't at the wedding (halfway round the world), but heard about it later. She told her sisters just before the ceremony that she had been seeing someone else, but they went ahead anyway, because so many people had travelled from overseas (groom's family and friends). She came clean after the ceremony, and they skipped the honeymoon. I think it was annulled shortly afterwards. | Y did u get downvoted buddy | 1.2 for less than a year? Either she had something GOOD on him or the judge was her brother. | ‚ÄòPlayfully‚Äô üò≠ | Did she not think to take some medicine? | It's a nice day to start again. | ***THAT'S WHAT THAT SONG IS ABOUT?!?*** | I went to a wedding day like this once, the wedding invite said it would end usually early. Turns out it was a ruse to clear out all the parents and grand parents so the hardcore wedding guests could take loads of coke.

Everyone pretended to leave then half the wedding secretly came back to be greeted by the bride walking around with a platter of coke in her wedding dress. I was somehow placed in the hardcore guest group despite having a long drive the next day. I spent the evening trying to awkwardly but politely decline lines from an increasingly insistent bride - I was like a terrible Hugh Grant cosplay. I still had loads of fun though.

They're still together and have two children. Lovely couple to be honest. | Do you want to build a snowman? | You win the internet and made me choke on my coffee. | I don't remember this episode but Nurse Jackie was so good. I miss that show | I was literally thinking this when I read it. I wonder who ever took that money‚Ä¶. they never said‚Ä¶ | It was an excellent networking opportunity for the coke dealer, I‚Äôm sure | Coke dealer is flexing that he's screwing the bride. | That was her ex pimp bf/lover/coke dealer ! | Sounds like they needed Chris Hansen to have a little chat | It's awful how he manipulated both sisters and caused so much damage. It's sad that people can get so blinded by what they think is love and end up in toxic situations. | To do whatever, it‚Äôs Alaska, more serial killers per know, square foot or some shit. We‚Äôre not getting technically at this point in the day, but we know what he‚Äôs doing. | Bit rough on the younger sister, she was most likely groomed. | Alaska has some of the strangest people I‚Äôve ever met in my life*.  I used to work at an Alaskan library where the they tend to gather. This guy would be just another creeper to fend off, would eventually get banned from the library, and probably get in trouble with the police. 

*Alaska also has some of the best people I‚Äôve ever met. | Wow. | two reasons people move to ak‚Äî either hiding/running away from something OR they‚Äôre stuck there (obviously not true.. but just something to consider for the folks who just randomly move over to ak). | Wtf. Name and shame. Alaska is small. | Man, that story starts out üò¨ but like... *maybeeeee*... and then just gets worse and worse the entire time.

Good luck to Alaska, I guess. | Leon Dicaprio move | I want to make a movie of this | Feel a bit bad for the little sister after she got groomed (no pun intended) and then cut off by her family for it. | jesusüò≠ | Damn what a Chad. | I really hate the Drakette | Let's be real, 80% of the registry was things she wanted. Hell, I'm gay and I still didn't get to put the things I really wanted on the registry. My one chance at a crowd-funded LEGO millennium falcon is lost. | Wow... that is so trashy | To say the least! Ladies: stop saying yes to the proposal if you don't actually mean it! Gawd! It's women like these where I think starting to imitate the royals (thanks, Queen Victoria) was a bad idea. | Cherry on top is when she accuses you of hitting her | And that's not even Jerry's most problematic relationship | lmao imagine your wife having a friend and then it‚Äôs Jerry Seinfeld | How would you ever trust her after that? | None of us ever heard from her again. So weird, she was an old school friend and she literally ghosted everyone she knew from before. Groom was happily remarried 5 years later :) | Turing had one of the most interesting, prolific, and tragic lives in modern history. His contributions to computer science (my field) cannot be overstated, nor can his contributions to the war effort.

He saved thousands or even millions of lives and kick-started the computer age as we know it today, and all the thanks he got was being castrated and killed by the country and society he very possibly saved. 

Every one of our lives would undoubtedly be very different without him.

Edit to clarify: his death was likely his own doing, but it almost definitely wouldn't have happened if he wasn't treated the way he had been. What was done to him by his own country was not dissimilar to what their enemy in the war was doing to people like him. | He paid for his integrity with his life. Most men at that time would have married her | I heard the same thing about the wives of Rock Hudson, who did get divorced, and Cole Porter, who did not. | I think there are people who are bi-romantic and homosexual. | >he confessed to her he had no attraction to women - even one he loved like her.

""I love you, but I'm not *in love* with you."" | I mean, to be fair, when my ex‚Äôs parents got divorced, all of their friends assumed it was because he finally came out as gay‚Ä¶ Except he wasn‚Äôt, they divorced because he was an alcoholic. But everyone they knew was just SO SURE this man was gay and in denial the whole time. Nope! Not even bisexual, as far as anyone knows. Several years later he married another woman, though I have no idea if they‚Äôre still married at this point as I no longer have to deal with that entire family‚Äôs drama. But if they aren‚Äôt, it won‚Äôt be because he came out as gay, it‚Äôll be because that woman was a fucking psycho, yeesh‚Ä¶ 

(Also, this guy was very liberal and came from a liberal background, he would have no reason to stay in the closet for so long if he were gay‚Ä¶ Frankly, I think he was just extremely comfortable embracing his feminine side and that‚Äôs why people thought he was gay.) | Why do you think he's gay? | okay, jokes aside, a mystical mountain cave all to yourself sounds fantastic. | Denial is ingrained in a lot of men from generations past, but I see it loosening more in younger generations at least. 

Even as a millennial, a lot of my gay friends just didn't understand that they were actually gay until later in life, as they'd put it out of their mind as something they knew they weren't, because it'd be a bad thing if they were. People want to be ""normal"" and will deny their feelings to achieve that, particularly while a teen or young adult.

As you age though, you tend to become more at ease and comfortable with knowing who you are, which leads to some digging into what you may have stamped down for years (therapy can help ramp that up intentionally or unintentionally). Imagine that gradually happening in your thirties when you're already married with two kids...in your mind, coming out could ruin everything for your family dynamic. It's just easier to be ""normal"" for some people.

I hope that the newer generations don't have to live like that, and I hope the right-wing fanatics don't erase all the progress the LGBTQ+ community has gained in broad, overall acceptance in the public eye and opinion. | Religion, unfortunately | Religious trauma is the root of a good chunk of this. 

Societal trauma is the other root. | My psychologist put it that sometimes you just need a safe person and home where you feel like you can figure your shit out. | Gay guy friend of mine was telling me how our friend (m) from high school is actually gay, and only got married to keep his trust fund.

Me: ""What? No way. He's married. To a woman.""

Him: ""Well, he hasn't stopped fucking ME, sooooo...."" | The monkey bars at my school had a slight curve in them | What if there is no mystical mountain cave? I mean, that sounds like a big part of the gig. | Did you just call me a monkey bars? | You make sense! People who think getting married to someone they literally can't feel attraction to will make them magically develop heterosexual happiness, do not. | Ok congratulations I guess? | And yet BI people exist.    

Funny how you can ignore that someone else might not be you and condemn them so gleefully | I feel I know this family, or one exactly like them. Truly devastating. | This is official Mormon doctrine as to how to deal with what they call ‚Äúsame sex attraction‚Äù:  Marry someone of the opposite sex.  That or a lifetime of celibacy are your two choices.   The Mormon Stories podcast has had multiple interviews with folks whose lives were nearly ruined by this crap.  There was a lesbian couple on who never knew why they hated sex with their husbands (whom they loved dearly) until they met each other and started to realize they were actually falling in love.  They‚Äôre very happy together and they divorced as compassionately and lovingly as they could, but they both described breaking their husbands‚Äô hearts as the worst thing they‚Äôd ever done. | If you‚Äôre comfortable being a shameless lying piece of shit it‚Äôs pretty easy. | you‚Äôre doing the typical reddit mistake of believing only hot people have sex. it‚Äôs actually much more often the inverse. | Being hot is not a requirement for being a sack of shit. | A lot of it is just telegraphing a lack of shame and expectations about sex. It‚Äôs like finding out who the other kids in class who smoke weed are. Who else doesn‚Äôt think this is all that big of a deal and who isn‚Äôt gonna be embarrassed for themselves or you later no matter how it goes? | Girls can go to the bar and find *someone* to go home with any evening, regardless of their looks or their weight. 

Men go through dry spells of 6 to 12 months | I wasn‚Äôt my place but I told my boyfriend as it was his friend‚Äôs wedding. Apparently there was lots of cheating on both sides | There's a certain type of person who believes being single is a failure.  They'd been told their entire adolescence and young adulthood that they'll find someone, the implication being that they need to find someone.  This is the type of person that'll latch on to anyone remotely showing interest, no matter how terrible they are. | Small towns with few options. | Some people like to play Florence Nightingale.  They think they can ""fix"" what is wrong, and actually feel a since of validation/pleasure/pride in doing so. | I watch way too much ""Real Housewives"" and I tell you those women choose the shittiest men that have so many red flags you could build a circus tent from them but they still go ahead and marry them.  It's insane.  My grandma said the best thing you can do for your children is to choose the best father you can for them. | I met someone in chem class. One of the things she told me within 30 minutes was that she misses her druggie felon ex with two baby mama's and he's back in prison... | Tinder | Think they can change them, in many cases. | And even worse (in this case) ‚Äî procreate. | Hey watch it or I'll come kick down the door to your pizza place after I get into a bar fight! | Pheromones do wonders on keeping people not good for each other together imo. | Worse. Where do people find these sorts of losers, still marry them, and then get *pregnant* with them? | They are the same type of person | I see you haven't met my cousin who married a guy who Danny DeVito in Taxi may have been based on. She knew he was shit but she stupidly got pregnant by him twice and married him. Marriage didn't last a year and many years later when his daughter went to visit him, she came back and said that she was pretty sure he was gay. | On Reddit??? | Birds of a feather ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è | And have kids with them! | & then have a baby with them. SMH | In jail it seems | A LOT of women have low self-esteem and feel like it's their only chance. Some feel embarrassed to break up when the relationship is already so official (especially with wedding plans). | I‚Äôve known women who were absolutely certain that not being married by X age in their lives meant they were failing somehow. Hell, ever since I turned 30 I‚Äôve had jabs about not being/wanting to be married. Not sure if men experience this at all but as a woman it‚Äôs extremely frustrating. | If that's the crowd you run in or have been raised in, you come to see really bad behaviors as ""normal"".

I escaped that shit - but omg, it hurt so much to go back visit friends and see their lives and what they put up with. | Some women are just crazy about the bad boys.¬† A very smart, educated coworker/friend went from dating a prison cop to an MMA fighter and then on to an array of totally antisocial men.¬† She could take her pick, and this is what she wants.¬† Her own father said he's never seen her this happy.¬† I think they're complete scumbags, but it ain't my life. | The kind that perceives any attention shown to them must mean love | The ones who are just the same.¬† Dick heads like dick heads | I think depending on the situation a bar fight can be forgiven. Kicking in the door to a closed restaurant is just stupid | My husband punched himself(working on a car) a few days before his cousin's wedding that he was officiating. ü§£ | A week before the only other formal, relatively costly event my wife and I went to, some friends picked me up for a road trip to serve divorce papers to a friend's wife. I was sitting in the usual hangout, and they pulled up in a car and said ""we're going to serve bobs wife divorce papers, it's about a day away and we need a mechanic to make sure nothing goes wrong with the car. We can't pay you, but we have enough LSD to keep you tripping the whole time"" so I hopped in the car and off we went. 1 week later, a few hours before the even, still tripping hard, they dropped me off where they picked me up, and my future wife/girlfriend at the time came and got me. She was a little frustrated that I dropped off the face of the planet for a week. So for the week before our wedding, her best friend and my most responsible friend were with me 24/7, inconspicuously keeping me from being kidnapped by other friends offering hallucinogens lol | I went to Warped Tour 3 days before my wedding and got sunburned to the point of blisters on my forehead and face. I look like a lobster in our wedding photos. | What'd the other guy look like? | We just had our 15th too! Congrats | That is pretty badass! | My cousin got arrested the night before his wedding for streaking! Luckily he grew up in a very close knit community and his parents were heavily involved with the community (did a lot for the people of the town and were just all round good folk) so everyone knew him as a harmless guys who was just a bit exuberant. Police picked him up and gave his mum and dad a call saying they wouldn‚Äôt hold him or charge him but they wanted them to come pick him up rather than just release him back into the wild haha! | In my best knowledge, none of the groomsmen fooled around with her that day lol | Is....is pussy gluten free? | They did have a specific gluten-free cake that her mother had made special for her, she just didn't want it shoved in her face. It was a professional looking cake, too, and he made it so disrespectful. | No. She's on a gluten-free diet and ordered specially made chicken wings from a local place, and the groomsmen ate it while they were setting up for the ceremony. | Thanks, ChatGPT | ""Hey Jesse, I'll have the usual"" | I would argue her routine did not work if this was wedding number 3. | I guess at this point she'd either be something borrowed or something blue....depending on the response. | That's exactly what it looked like. | doesn‚Äôt surprise me, what sane person would want to harm their partner and/or upset them? | It's such an easy conversation to have ahead of time. And most people don't want cake shoved in their face. 

Once a cake shove happens it typically means either they don't have good enough communication to discuss things ahead of time or don't care about their partners feelings. Both signs of a bad relationship.

That or you're seeing a rarer case where they both think it's fun. But that usually makes itself more apparent based on their reactions. | My ex wife did it to me after thirty plus conversations about how I really, really didn‚Äôt want it done at fucking all. The moment we got married she showed her true colors and when that mask slipped holy shit was she just a rotten person to the core. | I think the idea is that you both need to be on the same page and usually the bride has some expensive makeup done that they don't want messed up for photos so cake smashing is usually out because of respecting the effort. 

My husband and I cheated on the garter thing. My dress had under layer tiers and he got lost in between underskirt layers so I was gently kicking him until he grabbed my foot to stop it, then understood, and followed it up to find my leg under the dress. He used his hands and I tried to help him moving my legs so we worked as a team. Teamwork is a marriage thing so yay for co-cheating together. We also forgot the arm wrap thing and just held hands during the walk. 11 years of teamwork so far. | Yup. My ex did this. I was very mad. | I was specifically told not to do it, so I didn't. My bride, however, smeared it all over my face. Lasted 5 months. | At my nephew's wedding, it was the bride that shoved icing up his nose. | My wife shoved the cake in my face. Currently separated and waiting to get things in order to divorce. | Before the wedding, my fianc√© asked me not to shove cake in her face. I told her I never had any intention of doing that stupid shit. | My wife and I discussed it beforehand and she said she didn't want to ruin her makeup, but then sheepishly asked if she could still cake me a little. Equality is bullshit! | Yep, same here. Her makeup was all messed up and her eyes were watering from being bonked in the nose with cake and I thought that was bad. | Same thing happened to one of my cousins - the cake, not the blood. The marriage did not last. | Omg my husband smashed me with cake on our wedding day after I'd asked him not to. I was internally super upset but didn't show it. We have been married over a decade now so I got over it, but I do feel like he was careless with my feelings for the first years. When I read about the correlation between unwanted cake smashing and divorce I was like, that makes sense. | My sister's wedding was a groom smashing cake in the face. took her years and two children before she finally divorced him. | [deleted] | I'd like to think she killed him. | LMAO, good question! | I would have thought the bride could just have asked the officiant not to file the marriage license, and avoid divorce completely. | I was never so happy that my mother-in-law the event planner for the hotel we got married in, warned my husband ""no cake smash son."" He totally listened and we were happily married for 37 years until he passed. | Your message will be entirely lost on anyone who feels the need to beat their spouse | Am I the only one who thinks the groom‚Äôs father reaction is probably not new and the reason the groom is so aggressive? | doesn't sound too suppressed to me tbh | I misread that as ""i would have shit him myself"" while scrolling. How quickly i came back to reread. | Only on this sub. The same question has been asked previously. | Well, the same question was asked. So I told it again.üòÉ | How did you come to that conclusion? | Yeah, nothing kills the honeymoon vibes like the same ol' sheets and the sound of your parents' TV in the next room. | I think it sounds fun! Have sex and then watch impractical jokers which is inexplicably always on at hotels at night. | Ummm... Sex?   

Sex you don't have to clean up after? | Honeymoon bed bug special. | Weddings are exhausting day long events. | I damn near spit out my drink ü§£ | At least she got a strong man later... oh wait. | It did happen, unfortunately.  If I made up a story, it would be better.

It did get weirder.  The bride ended up passed out on the pool table and the groom disappeared.  He apparently showed up a day or so later.  The marriage was not a lasting one.

This was an Iron Ranger wedding in northern MN so it turned out as was expected.  Yes, Ranger weddings have pool tables at the reception.  If you have the opportunity to go to a wedding held in the event hall of a bar in Eveleth, I highly recommend it.  It's a party. | Only time I‚Äôve ever heard of it being helpful instead of petty or actively harmful. | He got both MILs to hold his piece too | Not at all. Consanguinity is one of the set reasons. | They saved the best for last. | Buildup is a key part of a writer's craft | In some Christian denominations if someone objects, no matter the reason, the wedding has to stop and won't be able to be continued. Especially in cases where it's potential incest. But this is why people get upset at joke objections | The priest stopped the ceremony and told the guests to go home and wait for news from the marriage site or the bridal party on if the reception was able to be cancelled or if there'd be a big feast to atleast not leave any food waste. There'd be no marriage until this issue was worked out and it would take time and counseling for all involved.


The reception was cancelled, some people were invited to separate ""leftovers need eaten"" type hangouts in the weeks following and the local food bank got the cake. | Why do you think they're still meeting as 'friends'? | New daddy issue unlocked | Most daddy issues have something to do with cocks | He knew she skipped having a hen party. | Seems like dad was sleeping with the bride and was jealous of her getting married.  Seems like the bride liked daddy better anyway. | At least it wasn't during the wedding proper :) | Omg I wish we thought of that at the time!  It‚Äôs been a few years now my cousin was in quite a funk for a while as you can imagine but he is now very happily married again! | She was so devastated. She kept his cats that he left behind until they passed from old age. She loved him so damn much and held so much hope. She didn‚Äôt have another relationship for 3 years. And she JUST accepted marrying him LAST year and said she did it for the legality of what they owned. I watched her go through complete hell for years. Now she‚Äôs a very angry unhappy person. She never got over that. | Curb? No incinerators in your area? | I would have sold it to get back a little of what I spent on the wedding. | That sounds highly illegal. You don't get to destroy other peoples stuff just cause they are mean to you.

It's cute to say these things on the internet but the rules still apply | Curb my ass, I would have *Waiting to Exhale* his shit. | You forgot to add‚Ä¶..on fire. | I wouldn‚Äôt go that far because she‚Äôs still had a life, I just don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs enjoyed it to the fullest-trust issues, depression and then her health. | I wouldn‚Äôt go that far because she‚Äôs still had a life, I just don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs enjoyed it to the fullest-trust issues, depression and then her health. | Exactly. Instead of wasting $50k, she got the pleasure of wasting $50k and being publicly humiliated in front of all of the people she loves most in the world. Hooray! | It was me. I was the bride. | didn't see that coming | I'm so sorry to hear that. I cannot stand my BIL and haven't spoken to him in decades but do have a relationship with his kids and grandkids. | He turned out all right. His dad dumped the stepmom a couple years later. | Since she refuses to answer this question to everyone who asked, we have to assume yes, he is a basic loser. | [deleted] | Maybe r/justNOMIL | Yeah, it was so weird and they divorced a few years later. I actually unfriended her shortly after. | To be completely fair, some people do have an open relationship in a way that they can do whoever, but not bring that stuff home, including talking about it. And it can be legit working for them.  

I do have a feeling this was not that case. | Does this happen to you a lot? | Or at the very least, have some manners and invite the dealer to the wedding! Is it really that hard? | Rookie mistake. | Day before?! For my wedding I sourced my shit a solid week out‚Ä¶ what if there‚Äôs supply issue with my preferred strain?! And the honeymoon bags were packed before the wedding, so those drugs needed packed too‚Ä¶ | Right? Rookie move. Smh | Lmaoooo | Wait, so she's Julia Gulia? | they're not sports fans. they're gambling addicts. | I mean I know for a fact that if my country is playing a World Cup match or my club is playing a CL match all other considerations are secondary. I would however plan important life events around that, it's not like you don't know when those games are happening in advance | >but what's the deal with so many of them being immensely tacky like this?

Selection bias? It's probably only the tacky ones who go out of their way to make sure you know their lives revolve around sports. Meanwhile the other 95% of normal sports fans aren't being complete jerks to people about it so you don't end up thinking of them as ""sports fans"". | Who the fuck would schedule a date on Superbowl Sunday in the first place??

Or a wedding for that matter. | Uh if you have your wedding during superbowl Sunday, I think you're naive to think a large percentage of your guests would not care more about the superbowl | Last year my husband‚Äôs cousin got married. The reception was complete with a tv so the family could watch the ohio state game. It was fucking wild to me üòπ | I have a relative that has to have his vacation hotel arrangements planned around what TV provider the hotel has.

Because he doesn't want to miss ""his games""

JFC, you're now a elderly retiree with no ownership nor gambling interests in a game, you can miss a game or two while on vacation.  But his family has worked around this for decades so he's not likely to change. | Former athletes tend to be sports fans, they also tend to be fit and attractive, so they don't have to give as much of a shit in relationships.


It's less that he really loves sports, and more that he's not really that into you | You poor soul i could never imagine going through that üò≠ | My sister had hers when she knew certain people would be traveling. It trims the guest list and you don't have to feel guilty about it üòÜ | I think she wanted to have the wedding as quickly as possible before he changed his mind. | The weird thing is that she was this super cute, super sweet girl who had tons of guys falling all over her, but she only had eyes for a guy who looked and dressed like Bobby Bitman.  In 1988 he was unironically wearing leisure suits and had a coke spoon necklace.  And her treated her like garbage.  No one could figure out what kind of spell he had over her. | I did not. I may be fucked up, but I have some standards. | Sheeeit...were I in that person's shoes, I'd go. I'd go straight out the fuckin door of the venue and go home. Gahhhh it gives me the ick and the cringe to just THINK about that happening to me at a wedding. üò´ | Asking the important questions | Penthouse Letters | It's just a jump to the left...  
And he's out the doooooooor!

She had her hands on her hips...  
And her jaw on the flooooooor!

There were no pelvic thruuuuust...  
He was driving her insaaaaaaane!

Let's Get Divorced Agaaaaain! | Communication is everything. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs no surprise that many people are very temperamental about what goes on at their wedding | we actually did it at mine!  LOL | I suggested this for our wedding and my wife didn't want to do it.¬† She did, however, suggest we enter the reception while the band played the Benny Hill song with her and her bridesmaids¬†chasing me and my groomsmen which turned out pretty hilarious. | And I‚Äôd be miserable lol that sounds like a nightmare. Crazy how different people can be | Same! That sounds like perfection to me. | Right?! I‚Äôm getting married in 5 weeks and now contemplating it lol | They're both fine people, just not very compatible. | Excellent self-burn | That sounds like mine, I‚Äôll look over at the back door while sitting on the back porch and see him through the window just a flaccid peen staring at me and a goofy look on his face while I roll my eyes with a chuckle  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø some would have you arrested & required to stop by knocking on everyone in the communities front door reciting a piece of paper | Wow you actually got me looking into that stat and that‚Äôs actually crazy! Maybe it makes sense though, if there is a huge spend on the wedding there is more of a focus on a party rather than a marriage. | Big reason why I never want to get married, but if there was a legal necessity to do so my compromise is a registry, no bullshit, no fanfare. | Thank you! It was decades ago at this point.

Edit: full disclosure, I found this somewhere and saved it for this purpose exactly üòÖ | Well it‚Äôs not entirely on her. It‚Äôs on him for being a giant piece of shit. | Yes from his ex-wife, the reasoning was ‚Äúit‚Äôs only a cake topper it‚Äôs no big deal‚Äù we won‚Äôt have to buy another one | At least sharpie the hair to make it less obvious. | To be fair, being charitable i imagine he thought all wedding toppers were the same. So to him it was a ""generic"" one | Fuck the brides mom? | Same. Both of my BIL's weddings were like this where getting a gift felt ridiculous. First one ended in 2 short years, and the second one is going quite poorly with the exact same red flags and pitfalls. After the first ended, no one was really bummed or sad for him because it was so clear, so when he asked why none of us spoke up, all we could say was ""would you have listened?"" Probably not | I'd watch that movie - someone get a screenplay written! | Mine, too.  My family hated my husband, his family hated me.  Our friends were taking bets that we wouldn‚Äôt last six months.

Our 50th anniversary is in December. | Same! No one was really doing it with ill intent. We were young (he just turned 20) and had only been dating a few months. Everyone thought it was just too fast. We outlasted every other couple who had been together when we started dating. 24 years later and I‚Äôm still crazy about him. | Maybe it lasted longer than everyone expected | My wife and I both said we weren‚Äôt going to do it, but we both knew the other was a filthy liar. The only solution was preemptive offense, I got a good deal of it up her nose and she smeared it all the way up the side of my face. 

We‚Äôve been married 19 years | My wife did the same and I hated it, but everyone was watching and I had to pretend to laugh. It was pretty humiliating have her smush it over my face unexpected. I should have known how fucking disrespectful she really was. What a waste of my time and life. I'm so glad another man mentioned this as I've always wondered if I was just overly sensitive or not fun enough or something... | We did this, and just celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary last week.  It was a cheapass sheet cake from Safeway my parents picked up after our tiny courthouse wedding.  We had a cake and pizza reception at our house with our few guests.  :)

At their wedding, my parents fed eachother a bite by hand, and my mother looks just ecstatic in the pics lol.  They've been married 42 years. | I did this.  Marriage lasted a year. | Number 2, gentle cake feeding, he was absolutely delicate with me. Two decades of love, three kids.

After reading all these horror stories, I think I'm going to make him a nice breakfast and lunch to take to work. | If I get married, this is the way I wanna do it. | The nose thing, done gently and with full agreement by both parties, is pretty adorable.  I wouldn't want to do it (and didn't ha ha) but am very happy for couples who do!  I don't think of it as the same as a cake smash. | Ha.  True!  And when they split up it was amicable.  Weird reason to get married though. | Stop making me smile so big! People are *looking* | Miller Lite: does it taste great, or is it less filling? | He's not your buddy, pal | I don‚Äôt think she has custody of any of them. Not a single one of them, but I‚Äôm only like 90% sure of that. | Yuuup my ex stepmom has 5 kids with 5 different dads. They're all super fucked up by having a new dad every 3-5 business years | See above. She was ridiculously hot. | Dude, thank you because I‚Äôm reading these in the bathtub at almost 5am and I. Am. Cackling. ü§£ | Like you‚Äôll get whiplash when she walks by hot. | A twofer. | I thought it was going to be that they met at the wedding after the drama and later got married. | It's my wedding and I'll cry if I want to!

fuck, I'm old... :/ | If I've learned anything from these comments, it's not just dudes lol | How many chances do you get to fuck someone who isn't your spouse during your wedding reception? | [deleted] | The groom and cousin were turned on, that‚Äôs for sure | Me too üòÇ | Are they still married? | She's not wrong, but it's weird she's thinking about it so much, and also entertaining the idea.


It's like if someone said, ""I feel like if I tried to stab my coworkers, nobody could stop me in time.""¬†


¬†Probably true, also really weird. | May you have many happy years. üíö | I was married to her brother. | I like to describe my wife as my ex gf sometimes | An older friend of mine tried something  similar with me when introducing me to his younger wife I just replied ""participation trophies don't count"".  His jaw hit the floor.

She took it brilliantly as we'd grew up together and hadn't seen her since high school. They were such a good couple until he died of a heart attack. Now she's with a asshole. | Now I‚Äôm thinking of some good replies:

‚ÄúLet me guess! It was past 30 days and you couldn‚Äôt return him?‚Äù

Or

‚ÄúSo your second one turned out even worse?‚Äù | I call myself my wife‚Äôs trophy husband‚Ä¶participation trophy but still a trophy. (She smacks me and tells me I;m at least a third place trophy) | I just know I would say something stupid like ""a bronze trophy is still a trophy, ha ha."" Or ""you thinking of upgrading (use hands to imply a larger dong) or downsizing (use hands to imply a shrinking waist)?"" I'm terrible at parties. | It turns out that prior to the wedding they had NEVER discussed having children. On their honeymoon, they discovered that they completely disagreed on the issue and had a major fight about it. I don‚Äôt understand how that could even happen. | I read these and then it makes me feel extra attracted to my husband | I found myself, literally exact same thought | read this comment, blew on my screen, understood the comment. | That person is an evil genius. | I use RIF, what is it? | What a fucking weird response | [removed] | First hand experience? Lol not everyone's relationship is fucked. | Even so, there will be quiet moments between them of little looks or sweet smiles or something that indicates that they are happy with their partner. Not the public moments necessarily | It‚Äôs the same type of cringe as the wedding toppers with the bride dragging the groom. I‚Äôll never know why anyone thinks those are funny. | I think, in the right crowd, that shit would be hilarious. But only if you *know* it's a joke, and you *know* everyone else knows it's a joke. If there's even a slight chance someone somewhere is being serious, you're toast. | I had seen them on r/weddingshaming and never expected to encounter one IRL! | TIL of those.  That's awful lol. | Remains to be seen. Wedding was only a few weeks ago. | Congrats, you guys! | My dad is still paying off his wedding after his divorce. It makes me laugh tbh | >I have a theory that the more lavish and elaborate the wedding is, the lower the chances of staying married are.

You're not wrong:

https://youtu.be/n-RS2QohNao?si=oAXvBDLr1VyrFeYf | I agree. My wedding was $1200 total. I wanted to get married to the love of my life, not go into debt. | > I have a theory that the more lavish and elaborate the wedding is, the lower the chances of staying married are.

It would be fascinating to see if studies have ever been done on this.  I was married for 14 years and spent less than $2k on my wedding.  Then again, we did eventually divorce--though to be fair, it was a very amicable divorce.  I still live with her and her new husband, even.  It's nice for our kids who don't have to be away from a parent. | To be honest, going to family weddings, the funnest ones were a simple service and the reception at a local VFW or hall. Nothing fancy. Those people are still together all these years later. | That‚Äôs crazy! I got married in the 90‚Äôs and Obey had already been removed from the vows, like IN the actual book of prayer.  We both vowed to love, honor and cherish, nobody had to obey | That's nuts, I never thought about it- But, I'm not surprised there are still Christian churches that include ""obey"" in the marriage vows. 

Also, the minister who performed our wedding was my Dad, I owe him for my progressive Christianity, haha. 

I told my wife that her last name was up to her, I didn't care. She laughed and jumped at taking my name, coz her maiden name was very easy to make fun of. Kinda like ""Delores"" from Seinfeld. | So why get a priest involved? Seems a little disrespectful. Its like having a ceremony in a mosque and eating bacon.¬† | >The girl has dated my brother on and off for years. She cheated on him with a lot of guys including the guy she was marrying¬† | What's even weirder is that both of them were airline employees and could fly anywhere on the planet for pennies. | ‚ÄúUnhinged‚Äù is putting it mildly! Lol | That sounds fascinating as a single guest who has never been married & doesn't know anyone there XD


Otherwise...yeah... that's so weird.


Also be too tempting to make up weddings to screw the statistics! | Her boyfriend was in attendance | It's very simple, it's establishing the power Dynamic for the relationship going forward. Now they're married, he's going to be able to do, say, think whatever he wants and she's just going to have to deal with it. | You don't respect them. Love is in question. Certainly a love of control. | My wife told me if I smashed cake in her face at the wedding she would murder me. She agreed to grazing her lip on the way in. I am happy to say that I still smashed it in her face, just a year later when we ate the topper. We had our parents over, her face was great and her mom was dying. She smeared me with cake that day. 11/10, would smash cake in her face again, just has to be the right time. | A tiny push that gets like a little frosting on her nose can be kinda cute, if the bride is game for that sort of thing. But anything more than that is stupid. | Sometimes it‚Äôs just good fun, my wife and I both swore we weren‚Äôt going to do it, but we both knew the other was lying so the only solution was mutually assured destruction. | I agree. My boss kept yelling for me to smash the cake into my husband's face. I ignored her and just fed him a little bit. He looked so good in his suit and he has a beard and mustache, why would I want to mess him up? I love him and it was his day too! | That‚Äôs *my* interpretation, at least | I think everyone got wrapped up around the thought of a perfect double marriage. Little sister was 18-19. When she hit the church the enormity of what was going down finally hit her. It wasn‚Äôt just a fun fantasy day, it was reality. Big church wedding, but low key religious. | Average white Canadians. Christmas and Easter Christians. | Oh weird I thought everyone did left ring. | I‚Äôve lived in Germany for 20 years and just last year at my boyfriend‚Äôs brother‚Äôs wedding, him and his wife put the rings on their right hands and I asked my boyfriend if they were supposed to do that and he was like yeah what other way should it be? My mind was blown that I had never noticed that‚Äôs how they do that here. | I also had no idea.  This comment makes sense now. | My wife did that too, but I just quietly grabbed her left hand and she was quietly fighting me trying to pull it back, we just low key giggled at each other. | The exact same thing happened to me. Didn‚Äôt work, the marriage was still valid, and she‚Äôs been stuck with me nearly 2 decades now. | Uuuummmm CONGRATULATIONS!! How has nobody (here) screamed this at you yet? 

I wish you both nothing but wedded bliss ‚ô•Ô∏è | Congratulations! | He knew she was raised in a religious family and agreed to have a church wedding. His ‚Äújoke‚Äù was seen as disrespectful and he was seen as someone who does not take the sacrament of marriage seriously. They divorced 2 years later because he was having an affair. Coincidence or not, the affair was with a girl that attended his wedding - no joke | Boomer humour though isn't it -""argh my wife is such a dragon I'm not allowed any fun"" don't marry her if you don't want to mate! | A good comedian knows their venue and knows their audience. This was not their engagement party at a bar with just their friends. This was not his bachelor party with just his bros. | I'm sure that's the case in your circle but the statistics are very much against you. | Are the ones who got married young still together because they like and respect each other? Or are they still married because they don't believe in divorce, don't know what a healthy relationship looks like, have made peace with each other's ""piece on the side"", etc?

This thread is entertaining but ""still married"" vs. ""divorced"" is NOT the same as ""good relationship"" vs. ""bad relationship"" | Apparently they didn't even have the moment written while they were working on the episode and that fuckup happened during a different moment in rehearsal and everyone went OH SHIT THATS IT, and history was made | My former fiancee would say that kind of thing as a joke but she made so much more than I did that everyone would get it was a joke tbh. | I can see my former fiancee saying that tbh. But given she was the bread winner we'd both get it was a joke. It's a bit weirder if you actually mean it. | Several conversations.   
She smashed my nose and glasses and I almost punched her.     
Her idiot photographer relatives wanted a second take.       
Took a month to get all the icing out of my sinuses.         
Thirty + years and she still doesn't listen well. | Likewise! | Yeah it was really embarrassing and she was doing this in front of her husband and her parents and parents in law. It got to the point where my then gf at time had to go over to her and dance with her so she would stop grinding on dudes that weren‚Äôt her husband. But she‚Äôd push her off and get right back to it. I felt bad for her husband | Oh we discussed it with the groom at length leading up to the big day but we respected his wishes of moving forward.  My last conversation with him was literally a few minutes before the wedding started.  No one could find him.  I found him in his truck smoking a joint and told him he shouldn‚Äôt be doing that as the wedding is starting.  He said it wouldn‚Äôt happen if he didn‚Äôt.  I said well then maybe you shouldn‚Äôt, we d can leave right now.  He said nope, let‚Äôs do this and walked in and we started. | Seems like an appropriate place for this:

https://youtu.be/F2TYGU6OcXk?si=oQsvwuBRAKsukrz_ | As someone from LA who grew up in the whole Hollywood scene and became a nurse instead‚Ä¶ yeah, this all tracks. | Are you telling me you met Kristie Allie? | You probably already know this, but you‚Äôre an excellent raconteur. | This was 29 years ago. I'm thinking Ed Sheeran most likely wasn't. | yeah, it's unpleasant | No pretending. We have a great friendship and her brother is my closest friend. I lived in another state when they were divorcing, so I had no idea anything was even going on. I realized if she would marry *that* guy, I was never on her radar. üòÑ | The first clue should have been that all the officiant could comment on was how good looking they both are. | I think it‚Äôs Kitty | Lmfao you can pretend I‚Äôm a dude if you like | Just a couple of unstable people. Recipe for disaster. 

Thankfully the rest are all boring. Just people rushing into marriage for the wrong reasons. You see it a lot in the military lol | Yep. | Well...one of them | I think he‚Äôd gone and grabbed it from his room just before and had a friend holding it. He was drunk. He made this big speech and then chopped. Everyone in the room gasped. | Ya but the twin brothers beard was a dead giveaway | ü§Æ Why would you be asking a man for something unless you actively want to communicate you believe it's his to give? Must suck to live somewhere women are considered either their father's or husband's property! Where I live that hasn't been ""a thing"" in more than a century. Seriously there are books from the 1920s where there are jokes about how no one does that any more.   
  
If any man had asked my father such a thing I would have dumped him instantly. | The man is a god damned saint and should be canonized by the church.  2 miracles you say?  35 years ago, he had a heart attack and was given 5 years to live at most due to his bad heart.  He was told that smoking was what weakened his heart.  He just... stopped.  No patches.  No treatments.  Just never picked up a cigarette again.  He's still kicking (and loves doing yard work).  70 years old and he looks like he's 50.

Also, it's a miracle that he hasn't killed her 10 times over for all the crap his ex-wife put him through. | üòÅ paraphrased of course | They introduce the wedding party to the crowd and generally the bride dances with dad and the groom dances with their mother.  Then the newlyweds dance together.  Kind of a welcoming ceremony as a married couple. | Yeah he ended up being exactly who I thought he‚Äôd be. | omg I'm glad I'm not the only one. lol that was so confusing | I think sometimes it's just that wedding makeup typically is wayyy heavier than anything you wear in your day to day life, and even though it's hopefully all going to be waterproof, smearproof, and everything-proof, you'll definitely be able to feel how there's basically a huge layer of stuff on your skin and you might instinctively avoid anything that might touch your face and mess up your lipstick. My insecure ass definitely felt aware of my wedding makeup in a way that I hadn't really anticipated beforehand, and while I for sure didn't lean away from my husband at any point, I probably acted a bit more reserved and awkward than I was feeling! | Why you said it twice? | Why‚Äôd you say it twice? | Two years tops, but I think it was faster. Technically, I don't think there is a hard date because it wasn't a legal marriage. The wedding was either right after or right before they had a kid. Fatherhood did not suit him for a plethora of reasons. He's not a bad person, but he's phenomenally difficult to live with. I've done it, and I can't imagine being married to him. I have sympathy because I'm probably the lite version of him in this generation, but the stress he caused the family mostly happened before me. I first met him in prison (for selling LSD). | So the groom (my husband‚Äôs BFF) had been making some very poor choices and had been drinking very heavily for months. and we were sure there had been another woman involved. Neither the bride (my BFF) nor the groom seemed happy. (They had been together for 10+years and had purchased a home together.) Everything was just off that night. Within 3 months of the wedding they were separated and he took off to go live with a crack whore (no lie). The next few months were hell for all of us.  Police, arrests, DUI, all kinds of crazy. The bride admitted she only got married because of the house. It was all her $$ that went into it. Bride is still my BFF. Groom has effectively destroyed his life and all of his relationships with friends and family. 
Crack is whack kids. | He wouldn‚Äôt even let us get a babysitter for a date night. We had to take her or not go. Not a single moment to ourselves. And I went to a movie with a girlfriend ONCE & he was txting me before the movie even finished to find out what was taking so long.. it was.. a lot. | Idek | Not my problem if they dont watch a well-made hilarious movie . | It was though lol she overreacted | Wow. What an idea!! No one thought of that until this second!!!!! | *snort again | ""Hey little sister what have you done"" | I used to do drugs. I still do, but I used to, too. | Well, white wedding, silk shedding | https://youtu.be/1ZzhhleFHxw?feature=shared | It was so good. The ending was so depressing, but realistically it kind of had to go that way.

The episode was the one where her ex husband got remarried and she needed a date to the wedding so she invited her young and attractive drug dealer. Can't remember what went wrong, but the ex-husband found out who he was and started screaming. | There were so many loose threads they never tied up. | Have a seat | [The Childcatcher](https://youtu.be/yVCZCAOKMI8?si=A3Gjg5H1D7SACy6Q) | Undoubtedly groomed, but... It's  hard to imagine willingly hurting your sibling like that. Like, she obviously didn't care at all about what she was doing to her sister by doing that with him at the wedding.. | I'm so old I totally get that reference! | There is still a chance! Divorce your spouse, then remarry your spouse. Voila! Those LEGOs are yours. | I begrudgingly made a wedding registry (I really wanted cash to buy a new washer and dryer) but my husband insisted that we need new pots and pans and other knickknacks. 

I now have three waffle irons in my basement still in their boxes 8 years later. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

I did get my washer and dryer though because my family knows me.
For our baby registry, we put a case of beer on it to see if it would allow it. We got so much because people thought it was hilarious. | This is why you need a partner who loves Lego and Star Wars as much as you do. Although, it can send you broke and take up a lot of room. Maybe you‚Äôre better off with someone who doesn‚Äôt share your enthusiasm for Lego. | I‚Äôd contribute to your gayfundme haha | That Star Wars LEGO is hella expensive.  I feel your pain | That is an amazing option for a registry!  Much better than some shitty china and more romantic! | Damn. I also got shafted out of my millennium falcon! We should have our own wedding where we just have good food and a Lego millennium falcon. | My husband and I registered together. Almost all the gifts were practical household items we chose together. We both picked one fun thing we wanted. I picked a stupid luxe bedding set. (We got it from the shower hostesses.) He chose a grill and house slippers. I got him his registry choice as a wedding gift from me. We both won until he decided to be cute and grill in only his slippers.  That night, the whole neighborhood lost, but we still had fun üòÅ | My wife made me put Warhammer on our registry list because she was concerned I wasn't getting enough treats.

I love that it went side table, side table, new toaster, MAULERFIEND. | I put a pinball machine on ours. No one bought it. Didn't even get the $100 bottle of rum. | My mother completely disassembled my Millennium falcon when we moved. Still salty about it. | My fianc√©e and I decided we both get one ridiculous ‚Äúprolly not gonna happen unless our parents decide to be generous‚Äù gift on the registry. His is the millennium falcon, mine is a cat condo lol | This hurts my heart. You deserved that LEGO set, dammit! | Personally I feel like the most problematic one was when he was a bee hitting on a human | He's always given me creeper vibes. | I mean *what‚Äôs* the *deeal??* | Well i love happy endings | A war hero who played a critical role in saving his country from fascism only for Britain to wield its own fascist laws to destroy him. | He all but invented computation and used those fundamentals to make the crude computer the Turing Machine. That's like inventing mathematics. Not calculus mind you like Newton, but mathematics in general. That is how prolific his contributions were. | >His contributions to computer science (my field) cannot be **understated**

I think you mean ""overstated"" here. | what the hell | I love that he was completely honest with her. He respected her and told her he wanted to marry her, but knew he couldn't change being homosexual. Love really is a funny and tragic thing.

[This is her interview.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB2e9R7bXCk&t=1s) She lights up recollecting about him and his proposal to her. | Haven‚Äôt you ever met someone who you could tell was gay without them telling you? 
I also have experienced gay friends who I could not tell if they were gay or straight.
It happened a lot in the 1980‚Äôs for me, when I was in my teens and 20‚Äôs. | Same way you can tell that person X clearly has a massive crush on person Y when they're of the opposite sex. And similarly, sometimes you'd never know someone was into someone else. 

Some people wear their emotions/attractions on their sleeves more than others. | In this economy? You‚Äôre gonna need a roommate to afford that mystical mountain cave | I was just thinking this | well, sometimes they have spiders. | If only.

I've met many people who are extremely intolerant of LGBTQ+ people who don't give the slightest of fucks about religion and have never have.

Obviously religion is a huge driver of intolerance but there's sadly more to it than that and plenty of people don't need gods help to hate. | Sometimes, that's true. | Infectious Madness From Seeing What Is Not Meant To Be | Yeah I mean just watch any episode of Jerry Springer. | But it ***helps***. | All they need is someone to pay attention to them and they‚Äôre hooked‚Ä¶ so sad. | Women in general get badly ostracized for single. It's far from a rare phenomenon. More and more women have been empowered to not listen to societies expectations, but lots of women don't have the confidence/power/support to stay single. | I have a friend whose culture/family expected her to marry young and have kids. She wasn't opposed to it. But, she didn't take the time to find the right guy. She just found a guy. She got divorced a year later. | It's as if being divroced is somehow inheritently better than being forever single. I spent too much o f my youth fretting over being single. I had a horror of it because of the stereortypes. While I'm married now, I've realixed the pressure to marry is still strong. It causes a lot of crappy relationships. | ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a certain type of person who believes being single is a failure.‚Äù 

You mean society? | I see you've met my cousin. | I think a lot of the women who are attracted to these types would behave a lot more like them if they were men. Women manifest that personality differently but I reckon they're kindred souls. | Especially if they are told there is 1 person for you. And only 1 | Or they have had abusive relationships normalized growing up, which is what this sounds like to me | I knew a guy like that. He was obsessed with getting married. It was all he talked about, and it was quite odd. | Where the odds are good, but the goods are odd | Or big town and a woman who‚Äôs ‚Äúunconventionally‚Äù pretty, has low self-esteem, and has been brain washed by Disney princesses.¬† Girls need a good role model like Xenomorphs and Yautjas | Where the women are good from far but far from good. | I think this is it. Some times people get so carried away with the saying yes and the planning and the public displays of it all, that even if they are having doubts they feel trapped and like they can‚Äôt say ‚Äúactually, my heads cleared now and I don‚Äôt know if I want to do this‚Äù. 

This is why I love the idea of eloping and not telling anyone, that way you can be at the registry office and if you have even an inkling of doubt you just go home | A lot of men and women have also been taught by lots of people around them that this kind of behaviour is, on some level, just natural and normal for men to have. So, while they don't see it as good, they also don't see it as wrong enough to leave. | Yup, I almost got sucked in this way. Well, this combined with being in a small town, where, it's not like there are no options so you're like ""ah may as well"" - it's that you don't even know that there are better options out there. 

At least my fiance wasn't violent or anything, we were just really wrong for each other. We were already engaged when I called it off. I remember it being really really hard to do so. I was just 19 and our parents had gotten to know each other, and his parents had kindly let me stay the summer after high school with them when my family was in flux due to a move. I felt like I owed them and that I was being unfair because their son was a good person, just not right for me and not someone I wanted to marry after all. I look back and am really really proud of that teen who decided her future was worth a little more. | I'm a woman, and yes, men do. | We can just make pizza at home, you don‚Äôt need to kick the door in you muppet!!! | Did he press charges? ü§£ | That's what he told you.... 

Dude is likely a secret member of an underground boxing club. | She wise lol | Im interviewing for mechanic friends I can bribe with acid, send me your CV üòµ‚Äçüí´ | The sun is a deadly laser | Worth it. | Chipped eye and black tooth. Granted he looked like that before the fight as well | I don't recall, other than that he was extremely large. You know how in the old westerns, they'd pick a dude up and literally toss him out of the establishment? I got to experience that. | Yes but it‚Äôs not vegan | Thanks. I thought I was getting old and no longer cool enough to understand double entendres. | I seem to recall a post about a guy having his 2nd wedding, at the same venue, where his brother, reprising his role as best man, began his speech with ""Welcome back, everyone."" | Though if her routine is to keep _having_ weddings then I suppose it's working. | Gosh, that makes me both sad and angry | IN FRONT OF ALL THEIR LOVED ONES. | Abusers | My wife did it to me twice.  The first time the photo was missed because the camera was off (wedding was a fairly low cost venue and photographer combo package, then we went to a restaurant after.  All in all, a good value).  The second time I was like ""you got me once, so not again? And she said yes, right before smashing it on me again.

She luckily explained to my simple mind that with all the makeup (well I suppose with any makeup beyond those super permanent lipsticks), there's no good way to wipe up her face from the cake and look presentable ten seconds later.  Once I understood that, the huge difference between her caking me vs me caking her made sense. | My husband and I agreed about NOT shoving cake in the face so we fed each other the tiniest bites. It was really sweet! | We didn‚Äôt even need a discussion. Everyone was shouting for us to smash it in each other‚Äôs faces. My husband got us two forks and we politely fed each other. | I saw a post on another board from a woman who, when she and her husband met with the pastor for premarital counseling, said first of all that if he did that, she would walk out of the reception hall and file for an annulment. | Yes! We had the conversation ahead of time and both of us were a hard no so we agreed. We went so far as to even use forks!! üòÇ | Weird. I didn‚Äôt realize I was a rare case. We didn‚Äôt discuss it ahead of time, he just did it, but I thought all grooms did it - I thought it was just part of having a wedding and I thought it was funny and laughed and I did it back to him. The pictures are great and looking at them makes me smile.

It wasn‚Äôt until 6 years later that I found out Reddit hates it and thinks it means you‚Äôll get divorced‚Ä¶ (which we are not, by the way - we‚Äôre happily married with two kids). | I thought it was fun to do the cake in the face. I didn't care about my hair or make-up at that point since the pictures were done. | > both think it's fun

even then they both would have talked about it beforehand | I remember my wife plainly saying, don't smash cake in my face.  It hadn't even occurred to me to do such a thing, but it was good to know that we were on the same page. | The last like 3 weddings I've gone to haven't had a cake feeding, a garter thing, or a bouquet toss. And honestly, they were better for it. That shit's all weird and unnecessary. | That IS bad. | But it was just a joke! /s | Google about the bride who was pushed into a pool and paralyzed. | I think it's all about communication and respect.  If both halves of a couple want to do the cake smash and they both agree, then it's all in good fun.  If one person says ""no,"" and the other person does it anyway, then that person is choosing to humiliate their new spouse on what is supposed to be the most important day of their life just for a laugh.  Not a good start to the marriage.  Personally, i hate the idea of the cake smash because it seems like a waste of good cake, and I would hate the feel of icing on my face (and ruined make-up at a party where the bride is expected to be the center of attention).  But if the couple is into it they can have their fun.  Maybe you could get your husband to do a cake smash at one of your anniversaries. | The minister or whoever left before the reception. And this was before cell phones. But you make a good point. Have the minister call on Monday ""are you certain?"" I was very proud of her but also figured there must have been other problems. | Exactly. There was a moment post-ceremony and post-reception where I had to sign the license and realized ""This is my last chance for zero cost...""

I signed and am happy (35 years now) but there was still that moment, you know? | It occured to me, but it's also possible that if the father had taught the groom to be this way, he might not have seen a problem with it or bothered to intervene. | I thought that as well. That's probably nowhere near the first time he's been beaten by his father, it's just one of the times he felt justified enough to do it in public. | It bears repeating, its a wild story! | ""Local motel"" would absolutely give that a run for its money. | Don‚Äôt kink shame me. | Maybe we are boring but there isn't any real clean up after sex. Like what are you doing that having a towel nearby isn't good enough? We could just have sex in our own bed like we do every few days. | Idk how in the actual fuck couples have the energy to uhh, consummate, after the ceremony. Entire day start to finish was a sprint. 

We got back to the hotel, at some shitty pizza, and passed out almost immediately. | Iron Ranger as in the work boots? I‚Äôm getting a picture of two bearded welders slow dancing in tuxedos. How close am I? | What's an Iron Ranger wedding? | That's what they said, one of the original intended reasons | This is the definition of ‚Äòburying the lead‚Äô. | I'll just leave this here:

https://youtu.be/F2TYGU6OcXk?si=6A4sKn5lV61pxO8x | What about the grooms parents? The mother can't have been very popular after that. | haha | if it were during the wedding proper, poor groom probably could have gotten away! or should i say‚Ä¶flown the coop? 

i‚Äôll see myself out. | I like you, always seeing that silver lining | Did he just not want to get married, or not want to marry her? What kept them together for 7 years? | Why the fuck do they do that?

My ex got a ""new place"" shortly after we broke up (read his affair partner's place) still left all his shit in my house including his pets and would only stay there if he had work. Didn't even bother to text me to feed them when he stayed away.

If I fucked off out, my cats would be coming with me.

Apparently there's a thing called ""Runaway Husbands"", she might find some support reading up on that/in the support group.

Edited clarity | That‚Äôs really sad. I knew someone who dated a guy for a few years when she was 19-22, but she never moved on after they broke up. It‚Äôs been 11 years and while she‚Äôs casually dated a few guys here and there, she‚Äôs never been in another relationship. He was her first and only boyfriend. 

She has also tried meddling with every relationship he has been in since they broke up, and a couple years ago he had to block her on everything to keep her out of his life. It‚Äôs really sad when people get so hung up on someone and are just completely unable to move on with their lives. | > She didn‚Äôt have another relationship for 3 years. And she JUST accepted marrying him LAST year 

Can't wrap my head around having 23 years of not getting married because of how much she loved her ex..? | Well, I would have kept the cats too, I love cats and it‚Äôs not their fault.¬† | Did he ever amount to anything? | how is Mr Anthropy doing nowadays? | ü§£ü§£‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è You're amazing! I hope you haven't had to spend much time with your hubby's family all these years.  ‚ù§Ô∏è | She married Mr Anthropy | So, did you make out with him? | Whoa. | It was me, i ate shit pudding. I swear | You have lovely in-laws /s | It‚Äôs me, hi, I‚Äôm the problem it‚Äôs me! | Your MIL sounds like a real prize winner. | Damn beyotch. Well played¬† | Um... the groom or the brother? | Did your FIL end up divorcing his horrible wife? | You're a good person. | Weird to say this but if you're legitimately happy and content, other people's definition of a loser means nothing.  I can't tell you how many people that would be stereotypically considered successful have turned out to be the biggest losers I know.  

Hope you both make each other feel valued. | I believe the stepmother was telling the bride that the groom was a loser. | I think the groom's stepmother was warning the bride about him -- basically saying ""don't marry my lazy stepson"" | Yeah, dude. That‚Äôs *not* the kind of person anyone should want in their lives | You'd be horrendously disgusted if you knew how often.  It's not a good time and if all I cared about was getting laid it might not bother me as much as it does.

My bartender friends are usually telling me about the guys at dive bars who come and cheat on their wives and all I can think of is how the guy would feel if I was sleeping with his wife lol | Seriously, I laughed harder at that than I should have. | That‚Äôs funny. | FROM THE WEDDING SINGER?!? | I went to high school with a guy whose last name was page and married a girl named Paige. Paige Page. | That or there addicted to sport parties. It's basically when relatively normal use sports as an excuse to get nuts. They drink excessively and binge eat junk food while partying with there friends. They don't actually care about what they're watching they just need and excuse to completely go nuts and not be judged by others. | Not really

Just Grade A, inconsiderate, misogynistic, man-child *dicks* | Yeah, like who gets married on Super Bowl Sunday anyway? Even if your team isn‚Äôt in it it‚Äôs so rude to the guests. | And how rude of her to have a bday on super bowl Sunday | That's awesome haha | I figured as much. I‚Äôm not exactly heartbroken over it. I‚Äôm happily married now (ironically to someone who is not into sports at all) | Wait‚Ä¶ is this facetious? | Did he have a steady supply of cocaine? | In cases like this I look at their dad. Chances are they're chasing these guys because they exhibit similar behaviours to the father and they're chasing that familiarity. | That happened to my buddy when he was a best man, but he did the deed and got caught in the act by the groom. The groom just started laughing hysterically. It was obvious that he was shit faced. There was a big scene and people were telling him he must be pretty drunk to react that way. ""You think I'M drunk?! Look at her! She's so drunk she thought the best man was ME! | ( X ) DOUBT

( ¬† ¬† ) NO DOUBT | A gentleman, begad. Good for you. | Thanks king | What were you thinking? You'd have a lot more up votes on your comment if you did! | So you told the guy after right? | Maybe she didn't look as beautiful in that dress as you say.... LOL | You win the internet parody award. Brilliant.  Just Brilliant. | Oh that is just beautiful. Thank you. üòÇ | I just said I would like this but you make a great point. | Mine too! It‚Äôs one of my favorite memories from the reception. | Going to take a wild guess that you and your spouse agreed to do it? | I love that so much oh my god | It is for sure. | It‚Äôd also be cool if you got the whole wedding party in on it instead of just the groomsmen too but that‚Äôs just me | Go for it! | I feel a similar way. If it makes sense to get married (we grow together, the relationship is super stable, etc) then I'd rather have a small wedding of close family/friends or just us two and tell others later | Wait what was this story | Absolutely unhinged moment to try to save yourself a few bucks | Un.FUCKING.believable!! | maybe if it's a generic topping that doesn't resemble the ex wife lol | And also sharpie the butt while you're at it | >Fuck the bride~~s mom~~? | ‚ÄúTil Death Do Us Parlay‚Äù 

Staring Luke Wilson and Cameron Diaz.

I could make it a hit | High fives are in order.  :D  Our 43rd is in 10 days.  :) | That gives me some PTSD. My mother offered me $10k not to marry my wife. When we were at the altar I looked over and my mother mouthed, ""You don't have to do this."" We've been together for 27 years now. My mom still doesn't like my wife, but that's her problem. | My family were fine with my choice of husband - probably because they knew I am a stubborn cow and if they had tried to interfere I would have broken all contact with them.  His family did not like me at all but he couldn't give a rats ass what they thought.  Strangely shared friends thought it was a good idea, but on both sides friends that we didn't share tried to talk us out of it.  Known each other 9 months before we dated, got married 8 months after that, celebrated 33 years together earlier this year. | Well, you two just warmed my heart immensely | I was getting death glares from my MIL during the reception. May she RI- actually, I don't care how her afterlife is going. | Good for you two.  

My husband was 19 when we got married, and I had just turned 21. | Not a man myself, but probably my biggest pet peeve is cake smashing stories of one partner just doing it anyway on the other. It's not about being sensitive, it's about expressing a boundary and the other just actively dismissing it | Oh I got plenty of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre being too sensitive.‚Äù She also said I was ‚Äúbeing too sensitive‚Äù when I confronted her about her cheating because ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt count because I was drunk‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not fun because you don‚Äôt party,‚Äù which I do, but unlike her for the last year we were married, I didn‚Äôt get drunk seven nights a week, including multiple weeknight parties with a bunch of extremely toxic single friends cheering on a race to the debaucherous bottom. | He's not your pal, Guy | As someone with bipolar disorder, I feel bad for everyone involved in that situation. Her, him, the other guys, the kids. | business years LMAO I'm sorry poor kiddos ;( | That sucks - I‚Äôm sorry.
My friend from school‚Äôs mum had 5 kids with 5 different dads, but all the kids and dads got on great and they had bbqs regularly. It was cool to see such a good, blended family that they were making work, but I can see this was very much the exception to the rule in most cases | Caught by the old hot/crazy line.  Super hot women live in a different world than all of the rest of us. | Good thing it wasn't a meat grinder and they weren't watching ""Fargo"". üò≥ | So top right of the hot/crazy scale. | Hah! No kidding | 100%! It‚Äôs just that the comment I was replying to was about a dude, but I didn‚Äôt make my reply inclusive enough, so that‚Äôs my bad. And I also talked *plenty* of shit about the women, too lol | HAH!! Gotta grab those opportunities when they come lol | YOLO!! üòÖ | The groom *was* the one getting married. 

Maybe I should clarify - I can‚Äôt, for the life of me, understand why *any* spouse would fuck someone else on their wedding day. Is that better? | You know what, I'm gonna leave the typo | Thank you for clarifying. Not that it really matters; it just helps me map out the relations in my head lol | Former Fiance also works | I don't understand how people can not be on the same page. I've seen this too. Hell, dating, if they didn't want kids, that was pretty much it. My wife wanted some. Here we are 12 years on with 2 kids. | My husband will be waking up to steak and eggs for breakfast because this post reminded me he is the best part of my life. | It‚Äôs just a generic outline with what looks like a hair over it. But it‚Äôs not a hair it‚Äôs just a line on the icon. | Appreciate the sentiment | Almost worth doing a one year update thing on this. | Tyvm | Bro what | Yeah, unfortunately obeying and submitting are still pretty key tenets in some religions‚Äô teachings/beliefs of marriage | ......Mulva? | Not all religious vows use the older wording. | I want to just deny this is the reason why some people do this, because I simply can't fathom thinking that way. 
But unfortunately I feel you may be right. Because why else? I truly don't understand the way some people view relationships and marriage. Idk how you could see it as a power struggle and not a partnership. I just got engaged and it bums me out knowing some people are like this. | I think that's what we did, probably just for a picture. | I'll probably never get married but if I ever do find the right person I will know for certain when she agrees with my plan to a little cake smashing that we then turn into a full scale cake fight with all the guests. That'll be the one. | sucks she was forced to marry only to divorce like a day later.¬† is she doing better now?¬† | Rural? Poor enough that a double wedding would be cheaper than putting together two separate weddings only a couple years apart? Was one couple having a shotgun wedding? | Was it an arranged marriage? | European here, I thought the same. | Oh, thank you!!!! This is so so lovely of you. Honestly this first week has been pretty great - wedding planning was an absolute bitch and now we have nothing to do and can just enjoy each other | > His ‚Äújoke‚Äù was seen as disrespectful

I'm not religious at all and I think it sounds like a shit thing to do. On the day of affirming your dedication to this person you want to spend your whole life with you're making a big public joke at their expense? | Sounds to me like it was the wife and her family that were the problem üôÑü•¥ | Your outlook isn't healthy. You should probably see a therapist if that's what you think marriages are. | Ah, and here I was thinking it was originally an in joke. Dang, no it wasn't. | Nope. | Thanks! All true. Every bit. | Did your ""closest friend"" know your desire to fuck his sister played into your choice to hang around? Am I supposed to believe *any* of that when you described her as a ""long time crush"" first and ""best friend"" second?


You're fake as fuck in a really scummy way. | Hey, I‚Äôve got a divorced-super-young military (ex) spouse in my family too!! | I read your comment and immediately sang it, thanks man made me smile reading your comment :) | Ok! I had never heard of referred to as a grand march before! Thanks! | Sometimes reddit glitches and the comment comes up 2-3 times | Shoving cake in someone‚Äôs face is an asshole move! Especially when it‚Äôs a Brides face. She probably spent a lot of time/money to look nice. | *shart again     
You may or may not be aware, habitual cocaine use risks fucking up your digestion system. | Where the wind blows, the coke goes | Idol hands do the devil's work. | They say I am addicted but that's bullshit. I can quit any time. Hell I've quit a bunch of times. I did more today than ever and still not addicted. I just like how it smells. | Unexpected Hedburg. | Slap her on the ass and get to bedding | Okay I think I vaguely remember that episode, I honestly just remember a lot of people putting up a lot with her. And she just pisses over everyone every time. But I guess that's accurate as to what addiction is abt.

I was still rooting for her even in the last season, but in every season she does the same thing of fucking ppl over and her life over so yeah, that ending was definitely apt. I'm glad Zoey was smart enough to move on from her tho, that was the one good thing I do remember from that show | I‚Äôve always wanted to watch it but I have a hard time getting into medical drama but you‚Äôve convinced me now | Because she had no frame of reference. My cousin's husband groomed me from a similar age. Thankfully I moved away before it got too far but I also had absolutely no idea how certain behaviours could have appeared to outside people. How could I have? It was all I knew. | Hate the Drake! | Friends and family hate this one simple trick! | Nah I like him too much and 9 years later I can afford it if I really wanted it. He did actually get me a smaller set for my bday so he's not a total loss. | You hear, but there were people in China doing exactly that to get around housing purchase restrictions a few years ago.    Except they were even more creative.  They respectively remarried various family members in succession.  They were caught only because they were registering too many marriages and divorces in a short period of time. | Genius | **""This is why you need a partner who loves Lego and Star Wars as much as you do.¬†""** But marrying children is frowned upon. | Nah, dating a high schooler when he was 38 was worse | Right? What's the deeal with Jerry dating a 17yo high school student when he was 39yo?  Super creepy. | *You‚Äôve taken it TOO FAR THIS TIME, Jerry!* | And then compare that to how someone like Jimmy Saville was treated and coddled. | Iirc, he never actually built a Turing Machine. It's more of a theoretical way to demonstrate the possibilities and boundaries of computability (see computability theory). He wasn't the *only* prolific computer scientist of the time, but certainly the most impactful.

The Turing Machine is still used when teaching discrete computational structures. It's capable of making any computation possible, which he proved.

Let me say that again. He *proved* that *any computation possible*, by any computer in the universe, could be done with something as simple as a Turing Machine. It's hard to wrap my head around that. 

It's been a while so I could be wrong about some things, but it's seriously fascinating stuff. I have no idea how someone can figure that stuff out, I could hardly conceptualize it. | I do, thanks. I made this comment in the middle of the night. I changed it now | I had the worst gaydar as a teen. I think I had two huge crushes on guys who were very much üíÖüèª | I don‚Äôt come off as gay, I had a stereotypically mans man career‚Ä¶. | if i live in a mystical mountain cave, my landlord is the sky and I will simply plant trees to pay my rent. | Come to magic mountain Charlie!! Yeh magic mountain!!! | Yeah, and if you have to get roommates to afford it, it kinda defeats the purpose. | Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! | Nah. Confidence is what helps. Confidence and no self awareness (or shame). | ...guys I'm right here | Am female. And from the ages 23 to 28 I was single by choice, just done with the bullshit that comes with dating.
In one summer, at the age of 25, two separate friends tried to get me to devirginize their respective male friends. It was really eye opening as to how little my friends thought of me. | Yeah, thy're portrayed as some sad figure.  For example, in ""It's A Wonderful Life"", the angel showed George what Mary's life would be like without him. It's why women's salaries have been historically lower than men's. Employers just expected women wold eventually marry and quit. It creates  a system of dependence and also incels. They blame women on their failures because they can't fathom a woman not needing them. | Yeah ‚Ä¶ the disgusting comments about deliberately childless single cat ladies ring any bells?  It is 2024. | Society is cruel indeed just for arbitrary expectations which do not come with an actual support system for life. | Ooooh‚Ä¶ I LOVE this! Totally tucking it in my pocket for later use | It's funny that this same phrase is used to describe men where I live in the Bay Area (for different reasons... or not... maybe it's just men in general. We can be an odd bunch) | I've heard that from college girls in the boston area about MIT. | I am stealing that phrase for later. thx | Love that last sentence. | Yeah, when you have no positive male role models in your life, dirtbag behavior becomes the new normal. | No, it was self defense. | This made me chuckle üòÇ | She is definitely the voice of reason in the duo. One of the reasons I married her is because for some strange reason she's just about the only person on the planet that can tell me ""let's not do that"" and I listen, almost 100% of the time. | Lol, if you got something pre-70 I can do quite a bit. Past that year, the newer it gets the less helpful I am. And with a head full of acid...I can *probably* tell you if the car is on or not, mostly accurately. All I remember from that week is driving down a rural road with tall, snow covered trees on either side and thinking ""this is some polar express type shit"". | reminds me of one of my favorite LH tracks

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl1FOuZnOAg | I'm 31, my euphemism days are unfortunately at an end | This is true. It‚Äôs all about perspective. | # ON A TUESDAY! | We barely even had to discuss it. We were both already very much on the same page about not shoving the cake. The photos turned out great and it was really nice. 

Couldn‚Äôt imagine doing that and thinking ‚Äúshoving this in her face would be the right thing to do‚Äù | My wife didn‚Äôt even realise that we were meant to try the cake so I ended up feeding her a tiny little bite üòä it was sweet x | Same with me and my wife. She said no immediately when we were planning and that was all I needed to hear. Wedding day we do the cake thing and it‚Äôs cute. Then she gets a teeny tiny bit of icing and boops my nose. Fuck if it wasn‚Äôt the cutest damn thing ever. | I said the same thing. Was not worried about it with my husband as he is a sweet baby, but just wanted to be 100% clear. I didn‚Äôt pay thousands of dollars for my hair and makeup to have it ruined by a fucking cake. That would be an instant divorce. | The important part is how YOU feel about it. A lot of women don‚Äôt want cake shoved in their face while wearing makeup they paid hundreds of dollars for, or their husbands will insist on doing it even though they are actively saying no. If you were happy doing it - that‚Äôs awesome! But a lot of people are not, and it shouldn‚Äôt be assumed that everyone is. | I agree!! We cake smashed and it was such a fun moment! I do think you have to be aware of how it would be received by the other person, though. | I am married to the kindest, gentlest man on earth - for the last 30 years! 
We had no intention of cake smashing but were married on a hot day and the cake was kind of‚Ä¶slippery. We still talk about who started the smashing but it was honestly that the cake slipped and we each thought the other was beginning to smash. 
We do not fit the cake smashing profile at all and it just cracks me up that we became inadvertent smashers that day lol | The bouquet toss is kind of a fun tradition. The garter toss is cringe AF and a cake smashing is such a stupid cliche. | Actually, it was the bride who pushed the bridesmaid in, and yes, alcohol was involved. | This an alt account then? | It is why when I do weddings I wait until the Tuesday to mail the license from a weekend wedding. It gives the couple a last chance now that the wedding is done to think it through. Better to have spent too much on a party and feel embarrassed now than to deal with the divorce or worse down the road | Butt stuff with lots of poop | Cum and blood dripping on the sheets | In case the original commenter doesn‚Äôt reply‚Ä¶ the iron range is an area of northern MN with a lot of iron ore mining. I‚Äôm an urban minnnesotan so I‚Äôm not sure if an ‚Äúiron ranger‚Äù is a miner or just someone from the area | Lede | Oh he buried it alright. At least twice. | From what I get, she was his ‚Äúfirst‚Äù. And in the month before the wedding, he met this woman and decided my friend really wasn‚Äôt the one. I guess he was right because he filed for divorce, married the new chick and they‚Äôre still together today (my friend still watches from afar). He raised the kids she had and then they had more. He told my friend he just couldn‚Äôt tell her-‚Äúhow do you tell a woman who just spent her life‚Äôs savings (50k) on her dream wedding that you don‚Äôt love her anymore?‚Äù were his words if I‚Äôm not mistaken. | It‚Äôs been almost 30 years. I never mention him. | I wouldn‚Äôt say it was about still loving him but more not being able to trust. | Husband | This seems like typical ""golden child"" type stuff for the brother and the parents | About tree fiddy | I too am intrigued by this. | Sounds like he's the best member of his side of the family | We need to know!! | Absolutely. Just a couple years later. He ended up marrying a much sweeter and kinder woman sometime later. | Who knows? This could be the start of a beautiful, volatile and expensive marriage. | Why is that funny? | I'm a woman and value certain sporting events more than most regular life events, not sure what this has to do with misogyny | Sorry - I posted this response in the wrong spot ü´† 

I was calling out the groom in the anecdote further above who abandoned his new bride at their wedding reception to go watch a game at a bar with his groomsmen | I wouldn't have been surprised. He always looked like he was about to head out to Studio 54. | Yeah I'd say it's a familiarity thing. People who grew up in the stress and adrenaline of an unstable home tend to have an unconscious desire for an unstable life in adulthood. If they still achieve a stable balanced life, it feels like something's missing, and they might spontaneously seek out unstable people to latch onto.

This is of course not true in *every* case where someone had an unstable upbringing, but it is a common occurence. | Old mate's either the king of suckers or a comedic genius lmao | It's much better to face these kinds of things with a sense of poise and rationality | Its reddit, he wouldn't dare risk his virginity so easily... | Like I said, I do have some standards. Hooking up with the bride at her wedding is a line I wouldn‚Äôt cross. Hooking up with her a few months later was a different story though. | Aren‚Äôt you supposed to tell the bride she looks beautiful no matter what? | Same here! GenX ftw | I'd rather just stay de-facto, the happiest couples I see are long term couples who have been together for a decade or so, never gotten married and have no intention to do so.

All the gay couples I know who were together before same sex marriage was legalised in my country haven't gotten married since nor do they want to. I've always considered gay couples who were together well before marriage equality was a realistic possibility to be the best couples because they are together because they want to be with and love one another, not because of a ring or an overpriced ""look at me"" ceremony. | Absolutely. Tell others later (if those others wanna throw us a little party after we tell them to celebrate then that'd be fun) but I'd rather spend any extra money (truly extra money, not money that needs to be used for a mortgage payment or something) on a wonderful honeymoon. City hall elope-type ceremony and a really cool trip just the two of us. | Man coulda just SKIPPED the cake topper, that no one would notice | Fuck both dads? | Yay!

Happy early anniversary! | Wow.  PTSD, indeed.  

Congratulations on proving your mother wrong for 27 years. | There‚Äôs a lot to be said sometimes for being stubborn.

Congratulations on your 33 years together, | Well, thank you! | You made me giggle. | He‚Äôs not your guy, Bro | Same | 100%! 

Might even be a little over the top right in the uncharted territories! | The more times you do it, the more times you get to have the chance to do it again! | Just like he left the bride. | We mutually realized that we didn't love each other anymore, and had talks about what we felt needed to change to rekindle our love.  

Both of us agreed that it sounded like a great idea, but that we both knew we wouldn't actually follow through on the steps that needed to be taken, and so rather than drag a relationship on that wasn't going to work, it would be better for us to split while we still are friends.  No sense in forcing it only to eventually hate each other.

After we split, I bought a 4000 sq ft split-level house (I was no longer tied down by her credit score, but I had custody of our kids), and she and her new husband now rent the upper half of the house from me.  I still have a 2000 sq ft place all to myself, and the house is incredibly well soundproofed, so I basically only interact with them when I feel like it, and there's no conflict. | bro 
# **WHAT** | Thats not Christianity then.¬† | Someone in another thread mentioned how it wasn't that long ago that they removed ""obey"" from the standard wedding vows. I'm sure some pastors/officiants still use it. And many women still take their husband's name -- while the meaning of that has certainly changed for most couples, for most of history it marked the man becoming the ""leader"" of the household. Hell, the word ""husband"" itself reflects that (like ""animal husbandry"").¬†


All that's to say, while a lot of couples *do want to be* equal partners, and I'm sure you and your husband fall in that camp (as my wife and I do), a lot of our institutions and conventions still have vestiges of¬†women's subservience being the expectation. And some women and men still default to that. Some even look forward to it. Which is why I'm 100% in favor of immediate annulment as a consequence for unscheduled cake-smashing.


Edit to add: congrats on your engagement! May your wedding feature absolutely no unwanted cake-to-face moments. | It wasn‚Äôt a forced marriage. It was 4 fools living in a fantasy. She was fine after a few weeks. She knew she wasn‚Äôt ready to get married at that time. | .....no | Another European here (UK) and it‚Äôs the left hand for us too | I love that | Exactly this, a joke would be playing with the element of surprise here, I could see a beautiful with an arrow pointing at her or something like that on the sole. Also now that I think about it, I would find a ‚ÄûNobody expects the Spanish Inquisition‚Äú really funny. | Nah, you're rug sweeping about how common abuse is in situations like this. | We heard later from a couple people who were there watching that a few wives had to tell their husbands not to say anything when this happened.   It was a weird relationship that none of us understood fully outside of she was going to inherit a lot of money within a few years.   Only reason we could see as to why he was with her. | Courtney Thorne-Smith? | Also, her brother and I are playing a game board game from separate continents *right now.* üòÑ You couldn't have read a situation more wrong if someone gave you backwards glasses. | You're really projecting buddy. I had talked to him about having feelings for her and he said I'm a good man and he would be happy for us. It's not about ""fucking his sister."" His sister and I were already good friends before I ever had feelings for her.¬†


We got closer as people do when you've known them for 10 (now 20) years. Her ideas for our future were different than mine, which was also a conversation I had with her, and I respected those. We're still friends. Mutual respect goes a long way.


Somehow you managed to boil a situation between 3 people you've never met, who have known each other for decades, into a situation of ""You wanted to fuck his sister. How did he feel about that? You're a creep.""


I don't have to justify myself to you, but I figure I would on the chance that maybe you can learn from it. People can have different ideas for their lives without destroying a friendship, and people can be friends with siblings without any creepiness. You assumed my only motive for a relationship was to ""fuck"" someone. That says more about you than me. | More projecting than an Imax theater | At least you‚Äôre real as fuck about what a goddamned douchebag you‚Äôre being. Seriously, bro. Get help | Lot of wild assumptions and angry projection there, Leroy Jenkins

Nothing they said indicated this person hung around creepily after her, just that they had feelings they acknowledged but didn‚Äôt act upon before finally moving on | Sounds like you're speaking for your personal experience/issues. Who hurt you? You're a  Drama Queen and in a really scummy way | U got downvoted bruh | I'm just hoping my brother doesn't fall into that. Our cousin is about the same age as him and is already married with a kid. They're not even 21 yet ffs. | Well good!! | And sometimes:

Cat:
What, am I the only sane one here? Why don't we drop the defensive shields?

Kryten:
A superlative suggestion, sir, with just two minor flaws. One: we don't have any defensive shields. And two: we don't have any defensive shields. Now I realise that, technically speaking, that's only one flaw; but I thought it was such a big one, it was worth mentioning twice. | If all the young men were hares on the mountain? | Zoey moving on was so painful but also, so good for her. The addict behavior was so realistic. Chance after chance only to fuck over everyone. But still, I really wanted her to make it. | It's not as heavy on the medical drama as some of them. More focused on what medical professionals have to cope with and their coping mechanisms. Lots of relationship drama. Basically, what wild way is Jackie going to screw over people today while chasing her addition.

Just beware, if you have any drug addition tendencies, it can cause cravings. I'm not even an addict, just raised around them, and sometimes it would even grab me because some parts were so well done. | I'm sorry that happened to you and the sister IS a victim of grooming, as you were. 

It's just, the whole burying her face into the groom's neck while the sister cries is a special kind of ruthlessness I guess? The speech too. I don't believe she didn't know how this would appear. 

I understand a young girl thinking that she is in love with the groomer and thinking the relationship is special, and possibly engaging in this relationship because she thinks they're in love, but she would've seen her sister preparing for months and willingly rubbed salt in the wound while doing it right at the wedding. | I think your comment just made me realize I was groomed...when I got older I realized how fucked up it was, but the lable of ""groomed"" hasn't occured to me. But your comment

>but I also had absolutely no idea how certain behaviours could have appeared to outside people. How could I have? It was all I knew.

Wow, that says exactly how I felt. | We all do | My partner and I are both adults, without a significant age gap | Oh wow yeah, that is way worse | To me, the Church-Turing Thesis is foundational to the existence of Computing as a field of study. With multiple competing definitions of what it means for something to be 'computable' it's hard for that word to have any meaning. By proving that all those definitions were equivalent, Computing became a mathematically sound concept and that paved the easy for so many other discoveries. | That‚Äôs very poetic | I said above I spent too much time fretting over being a single female. I wish I'd gotten a better education. | I hope they are now ex-friends because that is some creepy ass shit to ask of a friend. | Threw away your prime | ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs an old maid. She‚Äôs just about to close up the library!‚Äù | Also known to be said about Alaska, where the men outnumber the women drastically | From the George W Bush school of self defense, hit them before they hit you first? | >almost 100% of the time.

So, like 60% of the time? | I'm 36 and it appears I'll be immature forever. I need any little humor to get me through the drudgery of daily life. | Right in front of my salad! | In this economy? | Im pretty sure our conversation was something along the lines of: 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you putting cake on my face.‚Äù 
‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt do that stupid shit anyway.‚Äù 
‚ÄúOk great.‚Äù 

And that was that. | Yeah, it‚Äôs not about the actually cake smash, it‚Äôs the disregard for the brides feelings and wishes. | Alcohol had nothing to do with that incident. People shove other people into pools all the time. And it's always a bad idea and risks injury. | It was the bride who got paralyzed. https://people.com/celebrity/college-friend-to-be-surrogate-for-paralyzed-bride-and-husband/ | My officiant is one of my best friends and we went to file in-person together the next Monday instead of mailing it. Called my new husband and said, ""Last chance to just not file, speak now or forever hold your peace!"" Thankfully, he appreciated the joke and took it in the spirit with which I meant it, and we had a good laugh and filed. This is why we work together! 

If he hadn't laughed, I might have not filed it. It's not the worst last filter? | I feel bad for the cleaning staff. | But the towel?? I don't get it. We even use it at hotels because no one wants to sleep in that. | What was it about him that she felt like he was the one and the new guy never compared? | You.... Tell her and then pay her back for your share of the wedding that never happened. What an ass. | I think if I was her I'd probably never truly recover too. I mean 7 years of love and effort all undone in a span of a month. And a month before the wedding, that she paid for with her own life savings! But on the other hand idt I'd be able to trust my husband if I was the other woman. Cuz imagine if this guy did this to another woman, he'd probably do the same thing to you too in some ways | > how do you tell a woman who just spent her life‚Äôs savings (50k) on her dream wedding that you don‚Äôt love her anymore?

Before she drops that 50k, I would assume was the best time.  The second best time, I assume, would be anytime between dropping the money and before the wedding day. | Wow seriously, fuck that guy. That‚Äôs horrible. | Eeesh. That's rough. 

He is definitely a bit of an asshole for the way he did it. He would've been at least late 20s by how long they had been together. I do understand his feelings though, that's... rough. | Ah, gotcha. Sounded more recent.

That sucks, almost 30 years wasted on a pos coward who couldn't communicate. | Your friends story reminds me so much of myself, especially the never being the same after. I wonder if she grew up in an abusive home. I say that because I finally came to peace and healed after I was able to connect the subconscious feeling for my ex with my devastating childhood. It‚Äôs too complex to write about here but that is when I was finally able to really and truly close the door and be ok. It happened to me when I was 26 and I resolved at 63 , it‚Äôs never too late and I hope that happens for her. | Then who was phone? | Can confirm, that is a thing. | Hahahahaha that‚Äôs it?!  


I hope my future spouse has something better to say about me | This has already been done. Just look at any celebrity marriage. For instance, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard | ‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ | Hey, happy cake day!! | More like King of Cuckers. | Fuck the brides dad while the mom watches, and degrades the brides dad? | He‚Äôs not your bro, Man | I had that thought, but it‚Äôs really a crapshoot at that point bc you can‚Äôt always be certain there‚Äôs going to be a piece of shit family member or best friend who‚Äôs willing, you know? | Thanks for explaining; that's super interesting! I'm happy for you and especially for your kids. | That's not for you to decide now is it? | I'm getting downvoted but all that not being the case just makes it even weirder. | Right hand for this European (German)¬† | Have fun! | Bruh u are a cuck according to his pogic | I hear ""crush and also friend"" and immediately assume they're dishonest. There's a certain kind of hanger on friend who thinks if they hang around in a woman's peripherie they might have a shot one day, maybe if their ""jerk boyfriend"" breaks up with them and they're feeling vulnerable. I also think the fact that his ""best friend"" quickly shifted from the crush to the brother when called out is a bit damning. This guy reeks of ""the friend zone"" to my nose, but clearly others here disagree. | Jesus, here‚Äôs hoping‚Ä¶ fingers crossed for him | Yeah like a 17 year old is more than capable enough of understanding what they‚Äôre doing in that situation is fucked up. At her sisters wedding no less. She just didn‚Äôt care. | Church-Turing Thesis, that's what it's called! Well said. I remember my professor screaming to us ""IF *AND ONLY* IF..."" Many times. He was great. | I got shit for not getting married to whatever dude I was dating starting at like 22. Mostly from older family members who were horrified that I kept breaking up with my boyfriends instead of marrying anything that looked my direction lol. Literally had my grandpa frantically tell me at 27 that I would start getting less attractive every year so I better hurry up and lock down a husband!

They were so afraid I would end up alone. I was so afraid of ending up with the wrong person. I ended up marrying the love of my life at 30 because I refused to settle. | Oh hey JD Vance is in the thread!  No offense, but you're terrible and I hope Trump loses by three touchdowns. | That move is so dated now lol. | Tbf, he didn't say he was good at maths. | No, this is Patrick. | I had a courthouse wedding, so the county clerk's office was just *right there* down the hall.

No regrets at any point, but yeah.  That stuff was filed instantly.

Maybe a brief cooldown wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.  A lot of states already impose a brief waiting period after getting the license in the first place, so this wouldn't be a huge stretch. | That's why you should tip as much as possible¬† | Personally I think it was his looks-he was exactly her ‚Äútype‚Äù and he made her feel good about herself. She was a curvy girl and he was all muscles and hair. 
After the wedding she lost any ‚Äúextra‚Äù weight and has been very skinny for the last almost 30 years. I think she had an ideal of what her life would be and it didn‚Äôt work without him in it. | Oh -he also left her with an apartment she couldn‚Äôt afford with over salary. She worked two jobs for years. He was total scum. | In a way I feel bad for him as he will away be the villain in that story-but he‚Äôs not my friend, she is. I mean we knew something was wrong when she came home from the honeymoon. It took a month of her being absolutely horrible to us to find out. She came so close to breaking. But instead of breaking-she bent. And she never went back to the woman she was. I put up with a lot of things from her that I probably wouldn‚Äôt from another friend. But I don‚Äôt know anyone who has literally had their heart thrown at them the way she did so she gets wiggle room from me. When her pain started from the disease, I felt that it was her body matching the pain. She never had children-and I know she wanted them badly. I feel he took that from her. I wish very much she had never met him. I don‚Äôt think she mistrusts her current husband. I don‚Äôt think she lives him so deep that it matters to her. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs ever given her heart to him. It‚Äôs so sad. | Exactly. Instead of wasting $50k, she got the pleasure of wasting $50k and being publicly humiliated in front of all of the people she loves most in the world. Hooray! | Oh the 50k part gets worse. She got half of that money from a lawsuit. She slipped in a night club and fell onto  broken glass that was embedded in her kneecap. | Fuck him forever! | He was 25 and she was 27. | I agree. She gave him too much time, and too much of her peace. | No she had a good childhood but her father died suddenly when she was in high school. | Had to check what sub I was in üò≠ü§£ | Holy shit, I got this reference!! | Not the OP, just some asshole who was amused by your question going unanswered | >my future spouse

To quote Brad Pitt in Troy: ""be careful, King of Kings. First, you need the victory"" | He's not your man, son. | Christianity decides that, silly.¬† | Not really, you‚Äôre just being rather bigoted. | Yup, I thought it was left hand everywhere until my (German) mother in law texted me (American), ‚ÄúI hear Americans wear their wedding rings on their left hands, is this true?‚Äù and I was like ‚ÄúUh, yes that‚Äôs true, where do *you* wear them??‚Äù And that‚Äôs how I learned that some cultures switch the ring from left hand to right when they go from engaged to married! | You have a very narrow view of what friendships look like and I pity you. Greatly. | Don't make assumptions about people you don't know based on very little information | We have lunch a few times a month, and I have a great friendship with their parents too. That's not a periphery. üòÑ I guess you're going to shit on me for ""deflecting"" with their family now too? Someone can't possibly *just be friends* with an entire family. That's impossible.¬†


The woman and I are friends. That's called being adults, not ""friend zoned."" It's only friend zoned if I can't accept she isn't interested.¬†


I hope all the kindness you show others is returned to you.¬† | Marriage has never been presented as choice. Even now it is better, marriage is prefered. It's like our self-worth is based on romance/marriage.  Heck, marriage for love is a new concept.Then you're expected to have a wedding. Don't get me started on that. | Inside an elephant! | In fact, I'm in NJ and our state has a 3-day waiting period, which was used well for some very silly comedy on How I Met Your Mother. And you need one witness to come for the license application and two ceremony witnesses for the license itself, so we are relatively heavy on the hurdles. I kind of liked the important feeling it lent to everything, like it had the proper gravitas for a life-changing legal event and we had a nice little chance at each step to stop the train. 

And in my city, if you marry at city hall you have to cross town to file the license anyway, isn't that funny? Just offices in different municipal buildings handle those things. If you go to our county courthouse there is a 3-week waiting period from scheduling to wedding. It's really hard to elope here! Lol | Just the tip? | Wow, that is completely crushing.  I hope she continues healing. | He left his cats behind. That shows what a bum he is. | This is so sad...sorry if it's inappropriate to say, but I'm going through a bad break up and the story of your friend is making me realize that I should put all my energy into forgiving and moving on. For my own peace | He lives rent-free in her head, and I'll bet he never even thinks of her. | There's a sub for this? | He's not your son, friend. | Am I? How? | Yeah, left hand is engaged, right hand married. | We literally have a VP candidate telling women they are worthless unless they are married and pumping out kids. | I don‚Äôt think so. I think she will remain unhappy. She‚Äôs been doing it for 30 years and it‚Äôs who she is now. She also has an autoimmune disease that causes chronic pain. I feel in a way like it‚Äôs her insides matching the outside. That event completely changed who she was and is today. I know she still loves and has her life, but she is a deeply unhappy person. | My god this is bringing back memories. She didn‚Äôt like the cats but she refused to let them go. The cats were so sweet and she did her best with them. But he was really such a shit dude. When he picked up his shit-he brought the woman in the car to our job to drop off the key. I went down with her because she was so upset. She tried to drag that woman out the car while me and another girl ran interference with scumbag. It was such a  bad time for her. When she got home is when she realized he had left the cats behind and he had the woman in her house. I think she let him go while she wasn‚Äôt there because of that hope she still held out. She changed the locks that night. | Don‚Äôt feel bad and I‚Äôm GLAD you read it. Don‚Äôt be her!!!! I‚Äôve been there myself and wasted years being sad over someone whose face I can‚Äôt even see clearly in my minds eye anymore!!!! Please do whatever you need to in order to feel at peace and move on. Don‚Äôt give them any more of yourself because your energy is precious. Don‚Äôt let them change you, you change how you deal with them. She gave 30 YEARS to sadness. She missed so much. Life is too short love. I hope you heal and find your happiness again. | I hope one day he‚Äôs haunted by her. | You certainly weren‚Äôt, but the downvote train comes when it comes. Your turn! Sorry | Are you two still good friends after all this time? What has kept that going with how this event changed her so deeply? | Gabor mate writes on this in ‚Äúwhen the nobody says no‚Äù. The mind-body connection means the body will express what the mind tries to repress. If you don‚Äôt express your emotions all that energy has to go somewhere. | They say that the body keeps the score | You‚Äôre so right. Thank you, I needed to hear this :') | Shared trauma I guess lol. A group of us worked for a real beast of a boss and we bonded. There‚Äôs a core group of us that have stayed friends since 94. I was 18 and this woman and the others are all 8 years older than me. So they watched me grow up and I watched them move into adult life. We‚Äôve gone to each others weddings, funerals and other life events. We‚Äôve been getting together once a year since I left in 1999. | That‚Äôs such a cool group of friends to have | It is and sometimes it‚Äôs sad. But I love them."

I don‚Äôt need a billion dollars to be happy. | OP‚Äôs mom. | Do karaoke and actually try to sound good | Die | Exploit laborers for profit. So I guess I won‚Äôt be acquiring a billion dollars but I‚Äôm okay with that. | Anything that would mean a very long(months) or a forever separation from my family.

There's more valuable things in the world than money, so if I'm still able to enjoy that and have the money, sure. | Almost anything minus few things like mutilating myself | Get married to my ex again. She turned into the sister of Satan about a year after we got married. | Whatever! | Harm a child. | Marry Elon Musk | Anything that would have me possibly go to jail, never see my family again, kill anyone, permanently injure someone or myself.

Myself, on the other hand, I'm something of a masochist myself. | Mum? | Pay 2 billion of dollars | Pretty much anything because the good I could do with that outweighs whatever bad I can personally accomplish. | Anything. I don't want a billion dollars.¬† | Love how Everyone is Making Stuff like *""can't do 1 Bad thingy! Ok? You could use the 1 billion to save Millions of lives if you're that noble?"" Don't use it on you Use it on Stuff for the betterment of planet and people.""*

2) tribal: just friends and family off limits¬†¬†
3) personal: only i am off limits¬†¬† | Murder. | Kill a family member. | Kill indiscriminately.

You want me to kill a certain person, then it's a maybe. But killing just some random, hell no.  
Eg, you ask me to kill Ivan Malat for a billion dollars, I'd probably give it a go (except he's already dead). But just some random pointed to on the street? Nope. | Anything humanly disrespectful | I would not harm anyone | Ok I will be the first one, a bj | Chop off any of *my* body parts (although I suppose I can live missing a leg) and/or willingly get diseases, unless we're talking about easily curable ones like the flu. | Become blind | Listen to a full album by Sam Smith | Work. | Porn | Sooo many things ....

Everyone has a line until the possibility of real, then the line seems to move over some | Sell out my family | Sell my dog | Anything related to hurting/killing a child | I wouldn't do anything immoral enough I couldn't come to terms with in the event it doesn't pay out.

For most people any serious phobia or sufficient health risk would be a no-go. | Lose my wang. | Take a trip on a submarine. No thank you | ok, the interesting question is, is there is a price for everything?   
like a lot of people here mention many things they wouldn't do but what if we add another zero? not enough  ?  
add another zero... Is it still not enough ? add two zeros. 

can you still say no to the very thing that contradicts your morals if you in theory could have any price for it? | Now were asking the real questions. | Caving | eat some poor Ladys pet cat, or going off yesterday's question re live my worst day 4000 times | Eat a Klondike bar | Deep sea submarine | As Meat Loaf once said, ""That.

Anyway, to stay on topic, anything that would physically or morally keep me from enjoying the money. No self mutilation, no hurting of people/animals I love. | Kill someone.

Amputating a larger limb such as my leg or arm. (I could live without 1 ring finger though depends on how good prosthetics are now a days if I could still play games on a pc or controller normally i'd do elbow down)

I want the adventure and excitement of earning a billion dollars myself. And if I'm unable to then I don't want it. I want to be  accomplishing things my whole life.

Afterwards I spend my whole life accomplishing nothing. | Cheat on my girlfriend. No amount of money would make me do that. | I don't need a billion dollars, so it wouldn't make me do self harm or any thing like that.

Having that kind of money seems to do something to people.  And the more they accumulate, the weirder they get. | Buy our boat back ths North American and get it back in a fishing worthy state. Literally, my only goal | Honestly the list is pretty long. I‚Äôm not sleeping with anyone as it would end my marriage and my family is way more important to me than money. 

I won‚Äôt mutilate myself or take much physical pain.

(Assuming they can handle the fresh $1B well) | genius | That I‚Äôd do for free

*finger guns*

(This is a joke I‚Äôm fine) | Depends.  If I had a choice how right? What if I know it's something that can be brought back from.   Like... I'll have a doctor stand right beside
Me with narcan and a ventilator and paddles...and I'll od on an opiate but they can bring me right back.  Same with drowning. | [deleted] | No capitalisation or punctuation needed.

Just a pinky toe. | Not even one finger? I feel like a billion dollars could cure many wounds. | Happy cake day!! | What about self-amputation of one limb? | With a billion dollars you can have my left leg. I‚Äôll just build one | For that much ? Bruh I'd give both my legs no problem. I barely use them and I'd close to absolutely never use them if I had that kind of money. My family and future generations would have a VERY comfortable life and that wouldn't change mine so ... ü§∑ | So real for saying that | r/antiwork is leaking | Damn let me get my shit off first | thats saying ""nobody knows themselves"" which is far from true. Sure many ppl would be surprised to see how far they'd go, but im sure many already know their boundaries all too well | They always get so much engagement though. Engagement hacks | Tbh, I think most people know themselves well enough to know *roughly* where their boundaries are with something like this. I'm not sure exactly how far I'd be willing to go for an amount of money this large, but I know that I wouldn't murder someone I love, set an orphanage on fire, or do anything that would make it impossible to fully enjoy the money (like blinding myself *in both eyes*, or cutting off *all* of my limbs). Just increasing the amount of money involved doesn't fundamentally change things, once you get past the point where it would be enough for the person to be permanently wealthy. | All of these deleted responses‚Ä¶I‚Äôm as intrigued as I am disgusted. | The thread being almost entirely deleted‚Ä¶what the hell happened here | [removed] | Hate to be that guy but you wouldnt kill a mosquito or fly for 1 billion? How about a chicken you can eat afterwards AND have a billion dollars..? | Ain‚Äôt no way I‚Äôm going to sit here eating my cheeseburger and chicken nuggets and pretend I wouldn‚Äôt hurt an animal for even a million dollars. | If I have to kill an animal for 1 billion, that poor animal will die.

Damn | Nobody would buy mine, even my organs are bad | For a billion dollars? Sheeet | You could sell my body and we split the money. | Are you talking about slavery? Cause going to work is just renting your body. | What doed this mean? Selling organs? Or having sex with someone once for 1B dollars? | $20 is $20, but $1b is $20 50 million times | I‚Äôd do it once, maybe more lol | You wouldn't murder a pedophile for 1b? | Depends for me. And do I keep the money after prison? | depending on what you consider murder, you could just fly over somewhere euthanasia is legal and apply for a job there. you can then either ""murder"" a vegetable or a criminal morally. alternatively you can convert into christianity, be an extremist, get pregnant and then get an abortion. | [removed] | My immediate thoughts was ""kill a baby or child""

I guess I couldn't kill and adult either. Unless it was a pedo or a serial killer or something. | Congratulations, you've been recruited to the human centipede project. | selfish. | I‚Äôve never seen anyone crying on a jet ski. Just saying. | Here's my trick that helped me get over my fear of karaoke:


Wait until someone else has sung either Don't Stop Believing or Livin on a Prayer.¬† Once you hear one of those, it means pretty much the entire bar is too wasted to remember your fabulous voice. | I‚Äôd be mad at my wife if she refused a billion dollars because of me..  if she doesn‚Äôt want to sleep with someone for a billion dollars, I respect that.   But if it was because she thought I‚Äôd be upset about it then she‚Äôd be wrong.  I‚Äôm not a cuck but a billion bucks is a billion bucks. | Hear me out‚Ä¶ if you have a billion dollars, you can hire the proper attorney to keep you from that life sentence. | For a billion?

Ok. | Just by living we are killing animals.

You‚Äôd do it for 100.000 dollars. | That's hard to believe. A billion dollars is an incomprehensible amount of money and you won't even kiss someone of the same sex? | You might find your boyfriend would be even more upset if you turned down a billion dollars. | Insane answer.  I‚Äôve been doing it for free since 15. | Shit I do that for free | I mean, I would take it! Some people work their entire lifes to leave their families a good chunk of money, a billion dollars?? That should be enough for many generations, specially where I live | You don‚Äôt specify when I die.

A few months is nothing - I'd happily trade like a decade or more of my life if it meant I could have so much money that everyone I know could be rich for four generations (and I'd still be able to afford to do literally anything I wanted). | A finger curls

You drop dead instantly as you were set to die in just a few years | Mr. Frodo is that you?! | A whole foot? Honestly probably not.

Beyond the fact that I would feel shitty killing anyone regardless of how justified it would be, the entire killing pedophiles thing is legitimately insane.

If someone commits sexual assault on a minor then they should be tried in a court of law and dealt with through a judge and jury just like the rest of us.

Just because they‚Äôre a pedophile doesn‚Äôt mean you get to add on an extrajudicial punishment because you just feel like it. 

Look I‚Äôm not saying that someone who committed murder or rape and has been sentenced to life in prison is has made the world a better place, but their punishment is life in prison, not the death penalty. | Nah, no matter who, I couldn‚Äôt live with myself I think‚Ä¶ | Oh shit I didn‚Äôt even think about the amount of times I‚Äôve said I‚Äôd beat a pedo half to death I don‚Äôt see why I couldn‚Äôt go the other half for a billion /s | With a billion dollars you can't go into prison.

Meat requires 7 to 25 times the plant calories to ""produce.""¬† | Nope | I‚Äôm the insane one? | You keep at it. | genie wish, it‚Äôs a billion Iranian rial | I said rn | The avatar thing- man why am I being downvoted for giving a compliment üò≠üò≠ | Banking off the almost complete randomness of the market to take profits, however small, will work 90% of the time.¬† | Actually I‚Äôm calling out the people trying to get OP to take $1 billion but spending $2 billion to get it. That‚Äôs the kind of thing the former President would do.

Oh, so am I insulting Donald Trump? | You‚Äôre going in my note | Break penis or Queef nuggets? | It feels like if you had 1 billion dollars the chance of living longer will increase. Much less stress, personal trainers, personal chef‚Äôs, loads of sunshine, sleeping how much you want.
So even if you do something that shorten your life by 10 years, you will probably be able to just buy yourself a couple of years to counter out that. | Hello fellow smoker | As a matter of fact I PAY to shorten mine! | Absolutely my take too. | Win win ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è | Could be that there are just two limbs they aren't willing to amputate. Maybe they are really attached to their arms or something. Isn't English fun. ü§£ | Even if you had to saw it off yourself (you'd get a mild sedative and a tourniquet) and afterwards a doctor would perform all the steps that you end up with a healed stump. | I think I'd value both legs over having both arms too. The question is. Would you do it if you had to give up your dominant arm? | both arms, length ways | I think I‚Äôd rather one leg gone honestly. Leg prosthetics seem to work amazingly well whereas you‚Äôre never going to have the full dexterity of a real hand. Using a computer for one would be a pretty big pain in the ass, even just texting on a phone properly would be a lot slower. | DAMNNNN | [removed] | [removed] | [removed] | [removed] | [removed] | [removed] | [removed] | I would murder 2 randoms for half of that money | The capitalism metaphor is strong here | If the 1 billion deal absolves me from any consequence, I'd full force Mike Tyson uppercut one tap a baby for 1b | That's.... No....¬† | I would turn into Ted bundy for a billion | I'd include my family members. | Sorry for your loss. I had to put my cat down about a month ago. | That‚Äôs a lie. | When that money is real | [removed] | I think you know where it is. Get the spoon out. | This is a rational and considered answer. The immediate jump to capital punishment is insane. | The fact that you don't believe pedophiles deserve death says alot about who you really are. | Stop being a sissy, whore Laura! | You can live with being a sissy whore but not murder?!? /s | Yeah I'm all for the Dexters of the world lol | You could leave a billion bollars to your community and change countless lives. If only you would sacrifice yourself. 

But you won't because you are selfish. | Specify what type of animal, i‚Äôm pretty sure you mean pets. | Dang that is a lot more than I expected. But then again I never looked into it and only ever learned of like 1 vegetable that took more energy/polluted more to grow than beef.

Good thing I don't only eat meat. | The post expresses clearly one billion dollar tho, is the Iranian coin commonly called ""dollar""? Only ""cheaper"" dollar I know are Canadians, and it's not that massive of a difference anyway | One billion dollars rn. If you die. | Oh thank you! I'm happy you like it! And sorry you were downvoted, people might not like comments that are unrelated to the topic. That and, before you explained what snoo was, I honestly thought you might have been a creep. Maybe I was not the only one under that impression. |  of course you were and I approve of this message.  I think it's the duty of everyone with a triple digit IQ to insult the orange menace. | Don't do it. 

I'm just making sure I'm covered, legally speaking. 

The walls behind you will be covered as well. | Yes | Both, at the same time | Nah I eat way too much salt and cholesterol | For a billion dollars I'll do it with a butter knife. | Do it right, and they can probably put it back on. | That one guy did it with a pocket knife and no sedative. | I think that I'd give up both arms for my kids to never have to worry about money a day in their lives. | [removed] | [removed] | [removed] | [removed] | [removed] | [removed] | Shit I'd go full Stalin for a 100mill | I‚Äôd commit a new holocaust on the zionists for half of that lmao | Wait til you find out what communist nations did to get *their* billions! (whoops I meant *our* billions) | Respectable. You deserve the billion more than me | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_racism

Thanks for admitting it | The fact that you jump to death instead of rehabilitation or alternatives says a lot about how little our society values life | So gifs are creative nowadays üòÇ | Damn, imma watch this debate live if i could, Sissy Whore ""Laura"" VS The Bestbuy Guy  
Id be hooked to the screens | I‚Äôm not Jesus. | Don't know what was the comment before but if he used the word snoo they might have mistaken it for snoo snoo (sex). | Maybe, sorry!! üò≠ I didn‚Äôt mean to come off that way | Why would you go for an arm though? I feel like a leg would be a better choice. You could still walk with a crutch or get a really good prosthetic, you can still drive (an automatic at least, manual might be trickier).

Replacing or missing an arm would be considerably harder to deal with. | With a spoon. | Just for money? Holy shit | Yeah but there is a difference between survival and making money | You'd be surprised how fast people who are new money, or undisciplined can run through a fortune. 

Generational wealth averages a 3 generation span for a reason.

Statistically Elon Musks great grandchildren would work full time jobs, some blue collar, even with his full fortune passed down.

Sad reality | That's a good way of looking at it. I couldn't do it though. I'd be too much of a pussy lol | [removed] | [removed] | [removed] | [removed] | Now we're talking

1$ for 1 kill | Turns out the global military industrial complex does this all the time for about the same price | üò≠üò≠ I'm down for it ngl | LMAO why is Laura in speechmarks | You're a complex-mind arent you? | Exactly, I think that's what we all thought. | No worries! It's all clear now that I know what you meant. Don't let the downvotes get you down | Why would you drive if you have a billion dollars? I'd just hire a chauffeur üòÖ | My commander has 1 leg and drives a manual, he also still fights on the front line, prosthetics have came so far in the last decade and continue to keep getting better and better it's incredible what you can do with a prosthetic leg these days! | I've broken both an arm and a leg before and life is significantly harder on one leg than with one arm. | Yeah, I don't think I'd sacrifice an arm for any amount of money.


I think for a billion dollars I'd be willing to actually do the sawing off...but not live with the amputation.¬† Although with that much money, you could probably get a super cool robot arm. | A billion dollars. You could spend a million dollars a month for 83 years. | [removed] | [removed] | [removed] | [removed] | Putin be like, it's a deal! | Damn, them new hitouts rates are really bad huh. Did the crypto investments really hurt you folk, that bad.  
I mean, we all were quite sure, doindoink was to the moon, no doubts there, the rest was an act of superior powers. | Wait, is LAURA the name? | Exactly why I won‚Äôt KMS | Because I enjoy it. | Years ago I had an acquaintance that only had one arm.  He drove a Jeep with a manual transmission.  He also rolled his own cigarettes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶while he was driving.  It was quite something to watch. | I was thinking just this. Nick Lavery instantly came to my mind on this specific post. | Breaking isn't losing, though. If you lose an arm, it will likely end up throwing your back out over time; your limbs weigh more than you think, and losing an arm will force you to lean in that direction to re-center your mass which will put horizontal strain on your spine.

Lose the leg, get a fancy prosthetic with RGB and a detachable rollerblade foot, and skate off into that billion dollar sunset. | I suppose it depends on your lifestyle. I just feel an arm is harder to replace long term. We're further with leg prosthetics than arms, or rather hands specifically. I never had a broken leg though, just a hand in a cast and it pissed me off. | I would be more worried about phantom pain in my missing arm than a missing leg. | Read up on generational wealth.  Lottery winners..  Mike Tyson ran through 500 million in a few short years.   It happens.. a lot faster than you'd think | [removed] | [removed] | Nah I don't Invest in crypto, that shit kinda stupid lmao | [removed] | [removed] | Forgive me, O'Divine One. I mixed you up with the wrong kind of folks.  
You have my respect, and a tipped hat. I just pray you never go apeshit crazy, cause a dolla a life is a crazy trade system. | [removed] | [removed]"
