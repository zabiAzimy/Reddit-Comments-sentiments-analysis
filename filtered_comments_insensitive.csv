I'm sure this isn't related to the DOJ investigation
The world seriously operates on impulsive children's logic
They also said they wouldn’t invade Ukraine.
Michael Scott level reverse psychology.
How stupid do they think Americans ar... Oh wait.. no this will probably work.
"Trump posts AI picture of Harris in communist outfit.
Millions of Americans: I knew it.

It would be funny if the fate of the whole world didn't depend on some of these people."
"""Putin's supporting Harris, Harris is a dirty commie, vote Trump to beat the Russian agenda! Make America Great Again""

I don't know what's more annoying, how transparent and obvious it is or how many people will still fall for it."
lol the president of russia is literaly telling americans that they are more dumb than a 5 yo
Putin is 100% KGB and misinformation and psychological warfare are normal. This should be no surprise and we all know that trump will use this for his propaganda.
"wow such master strategician. He's at the one reverse level of ""reverse psychology"""
"""It's me, your perceived villain. You know me from all the shit that I bring into the world. Yes : that shit""

""I support Kamala *wink wink*""

""By the ways, I thinks a foreign country should definitely weigh in on your candidates, so this endorsement was okay to make""

Dassvee done y'all!"
it makes sense. Their only aim is create chaos and instability in the US. So what's your move when it is revealed that you've been sponsoring low-effort conservative social media influencers for decades? Come out and endorse the liberal candidate of course. Now nobody knows what to think. Exactly what they want.
"This is toddler level reverse psychology. 

""Oh nooo, please don't vote for Trump! We would absolutely HATE it if you did that!"" *winks at Trump*"
"This is a great chance for Harris to use this statement to promise no red lines for Ukraine and extra weapon shipments. Clearly, putin is all in-favor of it"
bwahahaha
All Harris has to do is announce this early that if she wins she'll allow unrestricted use of US weapons on Russian soil.
"Ahh yes, he supports the candidate who will continue supplying his enemy with weapons and not the one that has regularly said he thinks Ukraine should give up their lands to Russia to end the war. This definitely checks out."
"Looks like someone's propaganda mouth pices got caught, now he's got to throw shit against the wall till it sticks."
"The day after the DOJ shuts down a Trump supporting  Russian disinformation campaign.  This will change zero votes.  Anyone voting for Harris today isn't going to read this and go ""Oh no, I will now vote for Trump!""  LOL"
Anyone dumb enough for this to work on is already voting for Trump.
He claims this as he is literally helping Trump win.
"The goal of Russia isn't one specific candidate but to cause political chaos and weaken American views of Democracy. We already know this. They've organized pro Trump and pro Hillary rallies simultaneously at the same spot to clash with each other.

Stick to what we know and the ploy becomes obvious."
The ol' reverse psychology trick
Putin can suck my dick.
This is such obvious bullshit designed to give the repubes ammo to deny the election results.
He must have the reverse card in Uno
You mean Putin is saying Russia supports Harris while putting its money in a disinformation campaign to support Trump?
Right after Russian agents have been found guilty of spreading information in favor of Trump for the last 8 years????? Lmao
This is a huge troll play by Putin and will probably work on the MAGA folks.
"That's pretty much the same position as from 2 years ago when [Biden called Putin a crazy son of a bitch](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-bidens-crazy-sob-remark-shows-why-he-is-preferable-us-president-2024-02-22/) for saying that he would be more preferable than Trump for president.
Pretty sure it was something about Biden being more predictable than Trump : as a matter of fact, Putin took his response as the confirmation of that idea"
Meanwhile their media is paying Conservative influencers.
"This maneuver is entirely so that everyone can say that Russia colluded with the Harris campaign to sway the election and call it ""rigged"".."
"Putin's shills here in the US were exposed (Tim Pool, Benny Johnson, Dave Rubin, and Lauren Chen) so now Putin has to try to pretend he's not boosting Trump. Don't fall for it."
Of course he says that after he was caught influencing the election in the past. He hates being predictable so he is freaking out right now reaching for anything. He is a scared man right now and he should be.
Rule of thumb: The truth is usually the opposite of whatever Putin says
"Would someone just go on the internet and lie? I doubt it, he's gotta be telling the truth"
"lol

Fuck off putin. We see through your bullshit."
"There you go Putin fanboys, vote Kamala"
Liar liar pants on fire
"When your one plan to get Felonious Trump elected gets found out, then you pretend to support his rival in order to help get Felonious Trump elected."
Tim Pool what are we supposed to do now?!?!?!?!?
Didn't Putin also say they weren't planning on invading Ukraine even though Russian troops were amassing at the Russian Ukrainian border.
"Lol sure he does, just like he supported Hillary by leaking her emails to Wikileaks.

This will confuse so many of the Russia simps out there, as they are obviously incapable of grasping reality."
"LMAO THIS GUY! tryin to pull Ye Old Reverse Psychology trick.   

of course it will work on 46% of voters but they were already gonna vote for trump anyway"
"If you had watched Kremlin controlled state tv for this entire election period, you would have seen that Putin has clearly supported Trump all along.  But of course now that it looks like Trump could lose we get this.  Laughable."
Putin lies are just as ridiculous as Trump lies.
Everyone knows you want Trump. Just sit down and STFU already Putin.
Lmao the old reverse psychology
Putin trying to make people find reason to suspect Putin likes Harris?
"Americans dislike Putin, Putin wants trump to win, Putin advocates for Harris. Does he think we’re fucking idiots."
"If Putin says he supports one candidate, then he is doing it to sway support towards the other candidate. Why would Americans want a president endorsed by him?"
"Classic Russian tactic. 

Whatever they accuse you of, you accuse them. 

Create confusion everywhere."
Putin says a lot of stupid shit for the rubes to gobble up.
"""Supporting"" Harris while offering asylum to magas is the equivalent of claiming Jan 6 was antifa while doing a fundraiser fir the perpetrators."
If you believe anything this war criminal says you are not so bright
"Projection.  He’s saying this to make it seem that he’s not controlling Trump.  This way, Putin supports Harris, and Russia = bad, so Harris = bad."
Lol the KKK tried this same cute little trick once when they announced their support for a local politician they wanted to lose the election.
"Oh well, then it must be true. /s"
So he wants Trump for obvious reasons so he pretends to want the one who wouldn’t be easily manipulated.
Reverse Putin psycho MAGA Q dipshits strategy.
Oh man now all the MAGAs that have been saying they think Putin is a strong and smart leader will have to do the most insane mental gymnastics to flip this into Kamala is a communist because Putin would vote for her when Putin is a brutal tyrant and not a communist.
"Because all of the secretive endorsement of Trump stuff is coming out from TENET media etc, they're now trying to switch Narrative to sandbag Kamala by publicly supporting her? lmao. No one is falling for that shit."
"This is an attempt to sow distrust and rile the Trump supporters if Harris wins.  Putin is trying to foment civil unrest post election.  He doesn't support either candidate.  He is against the US.  He'll play both sides of the coin to increase the division.  For proof, look at the tenet situation."
This is a pro-trump headline. Clear as day to anyone paying attention.
Lol is he trying reverse psychology?
Psychological games. So silly.
"Well, if Putin said so, it must be true!"
You know how the news broke that they were pumping cash into promoting pro russia influencers? you think there is evidence they did it and are doing it for a certain candidate seeking re-election? So saying youre supporting the opponent would be great for damage control and an easy deflection. Allegedly.
"Putin is supporting the candidate who wants to continue Ukrainian support in perpetuity?

I know the target audience for this is deluded MAGA, but not even they can be that dumb right? Right? 😕"
This ia some real Spy vs Spy shit right there....hes s o tricky!
"Yeah, after Maga republicans blocked help to Ukraine for months Putin support Harris, jezz Russians do think americans stupid or something? /s"
What a fucking troll. Maga will eat this up lol
Their funding of anti democratic propagandists says otherwise.
"Who gives a shit. Literally everything their government releases regarding another country is simply to sow discord and feed a news cycle of endless speculation. 

It's that simple. I'm sure they do have a preferred candidate, and I think we all know it's Trump. 

But in a larger sense, we have to stop giving so much attention to their press releases because who gives a shit? 

Their primary strategy for years now is to try this bullshit psyops parody and we've got to stop entertaining it."
"Only someone as stupid as a Trump supporter would believe that, but I get the feeling that's the point."
Next we're going to hear Putin wants to arm Ukraine and denounce Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
"Who fucking cares what he says? I pay attention to his actions: pumping stolen oil money into subversion and information campaigns that support electoral destabilization and far right narratives in the west. 
By the way, why is he concerned with sanctions? I thought they were making Russia stronger and richer."
"Oh the old reverse psychology eh? Ha ha ha! ""If we say we support Harris, then people will vote for Trump""!!! It really is too bad there are people stupid enough to do this!"
Reverse psychology
"Bad move Putin. All Harris has to do is laugh at you now. ""Strong leaders"" don't tolerate women who laugh at them, especially after they grace you with their ""praise"". Their followers, even less so.

If anything, Putin ""praising"" Harris means he's terrified of her."
"Lol, the murder Hobbit says one thing, yet the Russian money goes to help Donnie Dollhands.
Yeah, sure Vladbo Buggins."
"He knows his endorcement is a bad thing.

Fuck Putin.  Fuck Russia."
Muddying the waters again…
"While I appreciate that US retaliation is likely clandestine against Russia, I hope we’re retaliating tf against this pig."
"This is simply in response to the DOJ release of information regarding Russian money funding maga propaganda and lies. It's actually a pretty good move because maga minions will use it as a rebuttal to the ""Russia backs Trump"" assertion.

If you want to know the truth follow the money. And Russian money is being used to help Trump. Only idiots would believe that the country that attacked Ukraine would endorse the candidate that supports US support for Ukraine over the ""do whatever the hell they want"" candidate. In other words maga supporters will eat it up."
"Lol, his attempts to sour opinion on her by supporting her are so clearly telegraphed. Russian interference requires US interference in the form of Ukrainian missles."
"This is so Trump, when he loses, can have his base perform a second insurrection on the basis Russia helped Harris win. Anyone with a brain can figure this out. Sadly though, not everyone's on the same mentality.

So the right says Ukraine is the enemy and Russia supports the left. Seems legit."
"How convenient...

Russia gets its hands caught in the cookie jar again, and tries to claim that it isn't doing what it clearly is."
You hear that MAGA cult members? Russia is your enemy again now. You should support arming Ukraine and giving them all they need to win this war.
"Considering that Trump is promising to dismantle NATO and to let Russia ""do whatever the hell it wants,"" call me cynical for not believing this former KGB agent."
Putin did exactly this with hillary in 2016 and it worked for maga voters.
he definitely wouldnt lie to make trump seem tougher on russia
"They're seriously trying to pull a ""Duck season, FIRE!"" on America?"
"Trump: I love the poorly educated Vlad.  
Putin: Yes watch how I successfully use reverse psychology on them like 2nd grader not even 24 hours after they find out I am paying their commenators."
"How about this, we all remember Putin doesn’t get a vote so who cares what he thinks"
Just a ploy to get the less than intelligent group of Americans to claim that Harris is in cahoots with Russia. When it's plainly obvious that Trump and the right have been worshiping Putin for the past 8 years or so.
"Reverse psychology.  Actually supports Trump and actively helping him, publicly declares support for Harris so Trump & co. can point the finger and say Harris is a Russian puppet. 

I wish people would see through this obvious ploy but we all know they won’t."
Irrelevant PoS attempting stochastic shit stirring.
just another way for MAGA to say Democrats cheated since truth doesn’t matter
He knows what he's doing. This is some desperate last minute shit.
"LMAO. 

Surrrrreeee just the DOJ investigation into funneling money to build a right wing propaganda network"
"LOL what kind of timing

I like how there's not a shred of evidence to say that Russia has helped Harris and mountains of evidence to say they've helped Trump but yeah I'm sure this is a legit statement."
Only a MAGA would take Putin at his word.
"With this coming out now with recent events, this feels like an attempt at a diversion"
"r/contagiouslaughter

Who said fascist cunts can't be funny"
reverse psychology will get them lol
"Putin claims to support candidate that will continue support to ukraine in attempt to deceive idiots. That should be the title imo.

The depressing part is it will work for some people :("
"The algorithm for Russia's media spokesperson:


2016:
* Who do we want to win: Trump
* Are we generally liked by the US? Yes
* Given that, will our endorsement likely boost a candidate? Yes
* Endorsement given for desired candidate


2024:
* Who do we want to win: Trump
* Are we generally liked by the US? No, detested
* Given that, will our endorsement likely boost a candidate? No, we've become a pariah and we can tarnish someone by association
* Endorsement given for candidate we don't want to win.


As an Aussie, I think your choice for president is as bad as ours for prime minister ... but Ol' _i just grab it wheres my boy Epstein lets sell state secrets mini insurrection_ Trump as a candidate? Goodness me. "
Now I know he supports trump
Support publicly. Privately they’re funding republicans…as evidenced by the recent indictments that dropped.
"Obviously if Harris wins it is because Russia hacked the voting machines!


/s"
"B*******t. Putin is such a canker sore. He knows his support is a black cloud and his country is a pariah state, he wants nothing more than his goon Trump in office. 


But him apparently throwing behind Harris casts a lot of doubt on her and scrambles the narrative. Stupid Russian head games. "
Ah ok!
Yes but he winked after saying it.
"As blatantly manipulative and childish as this is, I hope it gets thrown in Trump's face when he makes claims about how much better our relationship will be with Russia and North Korea under him; because they respect his strength.

Daddy Putin won't even endorse him publicly. It must hurt."
At least we're not as dumb as we used to be as a population. I think and I hope.
"Like telling a little kid not to eat the vegetables while hoping it will. As Maga people are on the same level, it will also work…"
If this was true then we’d see MAGAts everywhere start waving Harris flags. Tim Pool & Benny Johnson would be hyping Harris non-stop.
So it’s either reverse psychology to get people to vote for Trump or more likely he’s desperate after the most recent round of sanctions and pleading for mercy by supporting the “good side” and trying to say “look I’m actually on the right side now see guys? Stop being mean to me”.
That's going to be awkward for all those magats that support putin.
This is just like when he said he wanted Biden back
Putin is a big fat liar.
"The Harris campaign should come out and say, thanks, but no thanks."
"And meanwhile Tim pool just got outed as a Russian propagandist, the company he was working for was backed by Russian oligarchs, that’s the only reason he was making 100k A WEEK"
"Hahahaha his previous technique wasn't working, so let's try reverse psychology"
Meaning he wants Trump to win.
Which of course means the exact opposite.
Harris should play with and invite Putin for a photoshoot.
lol he’s only saying this because he wants Trump in office
This is probably Putin's best bet to influence the election in favor of Trump. Gives conservatives in the US the attack line of 'she's supported by Russia!!11!'.
It's good to see him getting out to vote.
"This headline should have read ""Even Putin thinks Trump is weak. Backs Kamala Harris"""
And he will do so by funding her opponents
The millions of dollars he's pumped into Trump's campaign says that is a lie.
lol trying reverse psychology now are we Poo-tin
"That silly goose, he can’t vote in the US elections."
Major trolling that might actually work. Never underestimate how uninformed voters actually are versus how much they claim they are.
Authocrates are like internet trolls in real life. Their model is 1984 and they all mastered double-think.
Mouth doesn't match the roubles
The most obvious false flag in recent years.
Yet another Russian lie. I think Garland Merrick prove that wrong yesterday didn't he?
"Putin suddenly switches to back Harris and specifically mentions one of Trump's weirdo talking points - Harris' laugh - in interview just as it's revealed that Russia's been paying folks to spread disinformation and rally support for Trump.

Nothing suspicious there. Definitely not some weird attempt at reverse psychology."
Somehow the dems are supporting Ukraine & Russia at the same time!
Russian election interference runs at all levels.
Trying out that new reverse psychology they’ve been hearing so much about…
"Yeah, I'm sure it's not a smoke screen for the upcoming election interference lol."
"We see what you did there, Pootypoo."
[removed]
"Journalists need to press Trump on this, get him talking about Putin. This is so transparent."
Screams psyop
In a shocking development Trump has also announced he will be supporting Harris.
"So basically, the exact opposite of that. Why would anyone actually believe Putin? All the Dictators want Trump. He's low intelligence and can be manipulated so easily.

His ego can be so easily triggered."
Faux News: See!! It's liberals that are the problem.
"It’s a smart move on their part. If they act like Harris and Russia are a big deal, it’ll make people wanna vote for Trump, which is what they actually want, because it makes the US weaker on a national scale.

Russia is NOT afraid of another Trump presidency."
Legit LOL!! Can’t wait for Donny dipshit to repeat this Russian propaganda mixed in with all the rest his espouses.
Ah reverse psychology Putin…saying you support Harris so people will vote for Trump.  Very clever…not.
Please can we now see the golden shower tapes!?
these types of people are well documented for saying one thing and doing the opposite lol
"HE IS LITERALLY PLAYING EVERYONE FOR FOOLS...


He is not ""supporting"" Harris because he wants her president, he's ""supporting"" her because it will throw more chaos into the American political theater."
Now that's Disinformation!
I didn't have this on my bingo card. It's obviously a tactic but still
His only goal is to destabilize the US. He doesn't personally care who wins.
"There’s so many lies in this. Putin says Trump put in place more sanctions on Russia than any other president in history. 

But the real sanctions don’t really start until their invasion of Ukraine in Feb 2022 with Joe Biden already 2 years into his term. 

Only idiots would believe this."
Who gives a fuck who he supports? This guy is a bloody dictator in a faux democracy.
now im confused who to vote for.
The ol’ reverse psychology trick lol
Putin says words publicly. I ignore them categorically given the FSB creature that he is. I move on.
HAHAHAHAHAAA OK bro
It’s not like any American should care what uncle terrorist dictator says
"Another example of Russian interference to cause division, misinformation, and chaos."
"Yeah he’s going to support the party that has been arming Ukraine to defend against him, instead of the guy that has said multiple times that he will hand Ukraine over to Russia. Totally true, much believable. And who the fuck believes anything this asshat has to say?  He and Trump are the same shade of shit stain."
ROTFLMAO.  Russian dis-info at its finest
Yeah I *totally* trust anything Putin tells me. *Totally.*
"He said the same thing about Biden earlier.  He is full of shit, this is a distraction."
*That* and some weak reverse psychology garbage to make undecided voters believe the Democrats are friendly to Russia or something like that...
"he endorsed bernie in 2016, just trying to pull the same bullshit. complete desperation."
Exactly! Surprised this comment is so far down. I think it's pretty obvious this is retaliation for the DOJ busting the far right fake news campaigns funded by Russia.
"Yep, has to be. That DOJ action just embarrassed tf out of Russia and their MAGA-paid propagandists."
"He did this with Biden too, he is constantly trying to confuse people."
PUTIN TO U.S.: YOUR SHOELACE IS UNTIED
"I noticed a sign at a bar/cafe when I was young in the 80’s that said “If you can’t bedazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with bullshit” it’s amazing to me how much that has been true in this world."
"""Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that."" - George Carlin"
This is the sad thing here. Why does anyone even care what Putin says when it comes to voting for YOUR president in YOUR country representing YOUR party and ideology? Make your decision based on behavior and credibility of the candidates and their parties FFS.
He’s trying to use reverse psychology now. How cute.
"Because we're stone age apes in a space age world. Monkey brain was built to do monkey things. Many of our societies and technologies are at odds with our nature. Doesn't help that our brains evolve a lot slower than our technology and culture currently do. Some folks would rather strictly follow their impulses over logic. The rest of us tend to blindly follow impulse on occasion, too, it's still part of the human experience."
Something tells me that this Putin bloke ought not be trusted. 
"*Hitler promised not to invade Czechoslovakia Jeremy, welcome to the real world…*"
"Exactly, Putin lies just as much as Trump if not even more. Actions speak louder."
"Only issue is that the average right wing American voter is Kevin levels of intelligence, and so will fall for it."
You know what. I’m gonna vote even harder now.
"""Duh, I seen on Fox News that Putin is voting for Harris, duh, I knew it. Duh."""
"In 2016, a coworker told me that he was voting for Trump so Russia would be on our side in World War 3."
Is this reverse psychology?
Yeah. This is about Putin preferring Kamala by calling her weak just like Trump has been trying to claim. This is so stupid.
"They smell crayons here bro. This will work. I saw it on fox, it’s true. Lmao. "
"Well, this seems like Harris is likely to win, and people can claim Russian interference"
"r/conspiracy has already swallowed the bait whole

So much for free thinking"
"This actually could be interesting. Someone right wing talking heads have praised, and whose propaganda they have repeated, supporting Harris… there is going to be some serious dissonance from this."

It’s abhorrent."
"""Harris and Biden announce the release of 1,500 JASSM cruise missiles to Ukraine"".

There... still supporting her, Putin? ;-)"
"They don’t fall for it. They actively seek willful ignorance and intellectual dishonesty. They will, with a smile, ignore everything that gives nuance to a situation. 

All the republicans that used provably Russian talking points? They disregarded it the moment it came up. Just a coincidence. 

Various Republican officials that push division that took vacations to Russia under strange circumstances and times? Russias just a place you go, no American soldiers have recently been tricked into becoming essentially a political prisoner(guy was cheating on his wife/gf). 

Trump only favoring dictators and bashing our allies on several occasions? I’d rather live in Russia than under a democrat!

Everytime I see a right winger trolling it blows my mind how flagrantly they toss around sex/gender topics as if they care in anyway that isn’t just malicious. They bring up pedophiles? They don’t care trump affiliated with what is likely the top pedo ring to ever exist. Women want reproductive rights? I can legally force you to carry it to term whether you die or not or we’re sexually assaulted! Gay/Trans rights? I love the derision I cause by pretending I’m incapable of understanding simple concepts but in other comments pretend to be a master of economics, food, etc. 

TLDR; they will use this knowing it’s bullshit. With people like Tim pool having been JUST ousted as essentially Russian shills, Putin is too predictable."
"First thing I thought was reverse psychology then I remembered Trumps ego - 

Trump will be so pissed that he wasn’t chosen that Putin will wish Harris wins…"
Almost too easy to counter. She can recycle almost any of US previous doctrines on Russia and give it an extra hardline nudge and make Putin look stupid
I thought these idiots were moving to some Christian enclave in Russia or something.
Meanwhile Trump's lower lip is quivering.
If Trump is elected again I think I will mentally check out. For so many people to be so ignorant is not something I can really handle knowing and navigating. Just middle fingers to rural America and I'll be humming a self-soothing song as the world brings around me.
It’s a free talking point
"I hate that I know how efficient reversed psychology is with MAGA fanatics...

Yeah, that's the most annoying part.

It's like seeing a kid being dazzled and amazed after an adult makes their lunch money disappear with a very obvious magic trick (to steal it)."
Now to see how many prove him right.
Many Americans are in fact dumb. That's a fact
Influence Harris in public. Fund MAGA in secret. Polarize and divide. Same strategy all over Europe now too. Create internal division in the countries and weaken and extremize governments
I mean this is basically a 3-year-old level “psyop.”
this is what it's for. It's so Trump can point and crow about who the villain wants to see win. Meanwhile on Russian state tv they promote Trump heavily to their own people. They depend on us taking no interest in what is said and happens within the Russian world
"I mean the Republican party spent the last couple years talking about how great Russia is and how great of a leader Putin is so surely the guy knows what's he's talking about, guess I'll vote Harris."
"The worst thing, is that it will still probably have effects in some undecided and uneducated people."
But he knows that we know that he knows that we know.

"I think the point of this is to give Republicans ammo. They'll just say ""Oh, they can't 'interfere' on our side, but when Putin publicly says he supports Kamala, that's not interference, huh???"""
"Of course she isn't going to promise that, because she's not going to do that."
Officer Balls
"""I will say i support Harris so then every American will definitley vote for my puppet Trump. My intelligence is immesureable""

Putin probably...

""We support Biden after aproving billions in aid to Ukraine, yes yes"" - What???"
Biden needs to do this today anyways.
With a mention that Putin supports her doing this.
"He said this in Russian for the Russian audience. If Kamala wins, it'll make Putin look strong to his people. Or rather, if he publicly supported Trump and Trump lost, it'd make him look weak.

At least that's my read of the situation, but I'm no expert, obviously."
It’s a counterattack to prevent the questioning some trump voters may have begun after the news of Russian interference.
I'm more worried about the people who were dumb enough to vote for RFK Jr. in this context lol
Almost like he's trying to divide the country...
"Well he is ex KGB. Psy-ops is one of their favorite games to play. Create discourse in your enemies, and they will never have to raise a hand to fight."
Oh it’s already working on them.  They’re so fucking stupid it’s painful.
Because his target audience is a bunch of fools.
"I know...this is the guy that said they weren't going to invade Ukraine the day before they invaded Ukraine.

Russians are fixin' to defenestrate his lying ass.  He'll say *anything* to distract from the mountain of Russian corpses he's creating."
Right. That's all this is. It's rage bait to give MAGA that moral high ground they so crave.
I highly doubt there are enough voters that are engaged enough in world politics that will take this at face value. I doubt this will move the needle.
Watch the maga crowd turn on a dime on Russia and all the sudden they are the bad guys again.
"Reminds me of when white nationalist Richard Spencer claimed he was ""endorsing Biden"": https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/white-supremacist-richard-spencer-didnt-endorse-joe-biden

"""Of course we don't have anything to do with Russia.  Putin himself said he prefers Harris.  It's ridiculous to suggest we have these [deep, persistent, repeated, financial, demonstrated, political philosophy] connections to Russian interference.

Something like that.

Putin is handing them plausible deniability excuses on the fly.  Weak excuses, but that won't stop the Republicans from using them."
Putin has a history of saying the opposite of the truth. He obviously wants Trump.
"Yea using maga logic it's ok for Russia to invade Ukraine because Putin is a strong leader according to their emperor God king trump, unless of course, Russia wants Democrats to win then they're bad."
">some weak reverse psychology garbage

Thats what I immediately thought! Lol even my dumbass saw that coming pootin"
while Trump almost literally is polishing Putin's knob.

"Yeah. The goal is fostering division and hatred. I’m  not trying to „both sides bad“ this. They would obviously prefer Trump winning since he aligns far more with russian interests.

But the goal is the US (and other countries) to be focused more on domestic issues than on what Russia is doing. They don’t care with which political party win they achieve that."

The average american knows this, however there are many many americans below that minimum threshold."
I don't remember anyone caring what Saddam Hussein's opinions were.
"I care when Putin and his friends are spreading propaganda and literally funding the campaign. Having Americas #1 enemy doing that is a big fucking deal. 

And it’s been hyper-transparent that this is happening for trump. This statement is just a late-game introduction of putins “do one thing and say another”"
"Well, in this case it matters because Russia is actively meddling in our elections and this would imply they're doing that in support of Harris (when obviously the opposite is true)."
"That's exactly it though, by endorsing Kamala Harris he is attacking her credibility and he knows it. 

He's not doing it to try and help her. He's doing it to hurt her campaign. Especially after the indictments that were recently released."
That’s my thought too.

"Illegally voting, too!"
"While short-sighted and unhinged, that’s a more cogent reason to vote for Trump than 90%+ of the others I’ve seen."

"That's hilarious, Americans are literally pond scum to Russia. Imagine thinking they see you as anywhere near equal, never mind allies."
I think it's to convince morons that Russia is trying to rig the election in an effort to get more people out to vote trump
"It definitly is. 

What Putin fails to realize is that most Trump supporters already accept that Trump works with Russia (lots of business deals and loans) and some even admire thu Putin strongman persona. Rights and freedoms are not part of this because about 15% of people are simple-minded (bell curve baby) and having a strong govt means something like Putin, Xi, or Jung Un. They simply do not understand liberty, the value of non-religious education, or why voting should be a universal right; ignoring basics civics and public engagement. These numb-nuts already love Putin precisely because he is anti-Democrat and that the Democrats are opposed to him.

So this move makes sense to putin and his propaganda machine; but will only confuse those in the US who love Putin already and more than 50% of us will see it for what it is: an attempt to trick some people into voting for Trump.  Only an idiot would think this in the US tho and Putin has clearly lost-his-touch. 

Being old must really suck... they seem so simple-minded Trump and Putin"
Kind of. It's like if KKK would endorse antifa and BLM in hope to damage their image.
"Nah, it's just to give a talking point.

Basically, when people say 'Putin is hackign the election for Trump' they will reply 'well that can't be the case because Putin supports Harris'.

They all know its bullshit, or they simply don't apply their brains. It's a bit different from reverse psychology though."
"To be specific, he didn't call her weak, he called democrats predictable and, allegedly, Russia would prefer that over unpredictable Trump."
He even gave a backhanded complimemt about her laugh. 
Careful. Hillary was “likely to win.” Don’t get complacent until January 2025. Vote. Vote. Vote. 
Nah. They won't look at their own pro-Putinism so much as they'll poke at the Democratic talking point of Trump being a Putinist stooge.
"To be fair


What hasnt elon done ?"
Just give Ukraine free rein to use the weapons they already received in Russia.
MAGA is in the palm of Putin's hand. Whatever goes into their shit brains will be morphed into some weird projection..
"I was going to say, this sounds like the sort of statement you respond to exactly like that.

""I accept the endorsement of the Russian President and my platform to supply thousands of cruise missiles to Ukraine so they can more efficiently destroy the Russian military."""
">""Harris and Biden announce the release of 1,500 JASSM cruise missiles to Ukraine"".

""But Ukraine still won't be able to use them on the russian territory to prevent escalation"""
Don’t threatening me with a good time.
with the restriction that they can *only* strike in russia.
"“We gave Putin the opportunity to negotiate, he didn’t take it. I’m telling you, everyone here, that he messed with the wrong guy, really the wrong guy. We wanted to give him an opportunity to communicate, we sent Tucker Carlson over there, anybody remember that? Tucker’s a great guy really, the best.

Putin’s a bad man, very bad, very evil, really. What he’s doing over there is very bad and we told him to stop. America, we told him to stop and he didn’t, he’s still going. So now we’re going to send everything, guns, planes, bullets. We’re sending everything over there to get him out. You hear that everybody? We’re gonna get him out! Putin’s going to wish he never messed with us, he’s in big trouble, the biggest really.”"
"Or better yet, she can simply say that she supports Ukraine winning the war and express desire for Putin to be tried as a war criminal."
It's not aimed at people who think too much.
"Call me Nostradamus, but all of MAGA"
"Absolutely. I’m convinced that Brexit happened due to a mix of Russian disinformation, dirty Russian money going to pro-brexit orgs, and a huge amount of people being so gullible and stupid that they believed all of the bullshit that was being thrown about by Farage and his cronies."
"It's crazy that people think world leaders are idiots for doing shit like this, this sort of thing can genuinely have an impact even minimal on dumb swing voters which coupled with other strategies could help get their result. If you've spotted the idiocy of the strategy then the dude with a hundred highly educated advisors has at least been advised of the pros and cons."
"When I was at ""dassvee"" my first thought was ""oh no, here they go englishizing foreign words again"". But this is special and I love it."
"Harris should announce that if she wins she’ll allow it, then around a week later the Biden admin should quietly start allowing it anyway."
They're probably holding back so they won't affect the election.
But then oil prices will rise right before an election.
Exactly. This isn’t targeted at Harris voters. It’s targeted at soft Trump voters to shore up their support.
It should be painful for the stupid people instead of the rest of us feeling it.
The stated Russian geopolitical position has been to divide America since the 80s
"With Trump and FOX Entertainment repeating that for one week they'll manipulate the brainwashed to *that* stance. It'll take just one week for the MAGA cult to experience this pivot to now disliking Russia. 

And Russia's paid media agents - because of course there's more out there - will become anti-Russia and pro-Trump as well. 

The game changed and Russia is absolutely doing more reverse psychology tricks we haven't found yet. 

One week. That's all it'll take."
Good. Then maybe they’ll be more supportive of Ukraine.
It already happened with Musk. Remember when electric vehicles were a bunch of pussy liberal shit that die hard alpha Americans won't tolerate? Then when he made it clear he was against liberals all of them had a stroke and now he's some genius they respect.
Someone quickly write up some Ukraine aid bills and put them to a vote.
"Yeah i think it’s the main gamble here….

Especially since Ukraine support is rising rn even more in regards to the dems voters with the Kursk offensive 

Funy how russian propaganda was portraying Trump as a « fair » and « wise » candidate a few days agos….im really curious how they are going to spin this one out.

But hey that Russian propaganda 1984 style, confusion and disinformations."
We've always been at war with East Asia.
"If that's what it takes, I accept it. Hating Russia should be something every American does at this point."
"I can't take the mental gymnastics anymore, its destroying my mental back"
Russian doesn't do anything that is not well calculated and discussed and planned with strategy.. This is not a fuzzy warm endorsement but as somebody else said just negative confusion to throw into the mix... And I'm sure orchestrated with his obedient orange servants approval
"I'm honestly surprised Putin is the first major entity to go this, but not surprised that people like Richard Spencer have already given it a go. Endorsing Biden or Harris just to rub their stink against Dems feels exactly like what chicken shits like Putin and the KKK would do."
"I'm sure that's obvious to most here that follow politics, but I think Russia is hoping to confuse undecided voters where a top reason Democrats and those favoring Democrats have been giving for people to not support Trump and Republicans is due to Russia favoring them and they likewise are more favorable to Russia overall, especially Trump and those more aligned with him. I'm hoping few fall for this (Putin claiming to support Harris)."
"Some people change but they largely don't and reverse psychology is often more effective. It's effectively an attack ad which are the majority of political ads these days. ""Sure I'm a racist and there is enough evidence it can't be denied so I'll try to bring the opposition down by appearing to associate with them"". 

It's an interesting tactic because it requires knowing that your opinion is unpopular. The hope is to swing more voters by associating your known unpopular opinion with your opposition."
"That, and he has a history of simply trying to sow chaos. They pumped money into BLM and anti-BLM causes simultaneously a few years ago - because American infighting was good for Russia. 

Probably would be better to just spend their money domestically to improve quality of life, but Putin is nuts."
Silver lining:  maybe we will get bipartisan support for Ukraine out of this.
“I’m glad Russia supports our commitment to supplying Ukraine the aid it needs to defend itself from Russia”
"Dems can say whatever they want, Republican voters will never listen to a word they say. Faux News will run this story and there's nothing you could ever do to convince their audience that it's simply not true and it's quite the opposite."

">As a European, I'm consistently appalled with how much the us elections are about local politics and ignore the rest of the world.


Well because people care for domestic affairs more than foreign and the US is a big place and European affairs are being left on the sidelines."
"""As a European"" ugh please stop embarassing all of us with these sweeping statements. Belive it or not but most ordinary people regardless of nation votes based on immediate local concerns unless there is a developing immediate international issue that catches peoples attention.

Put it this way do you believe that the 2026 Swedish election will be determined by people going out in droves to decide on the Israel/Palestine conflict or will the biggest issues for voters, like in previous years be healthcare, education, law and order, energy and welfare?"
How many democrats have visited Russia on the fourth of July?
"… you’re appalled that US elections focus mostly on US issues? That’s completely fucking ludicrous lmao. 

Lemme guess you probably also believe the US shouldn’t meddle in international affairs, and should let countries have their own autonomy."
">As a European, I’m constantly appalled with how much the us elections are about local politics and ignore the rest of the world 

…I mean, yeah? Which politicians are in office directly influences literally everything about my life. While foreign policy *is* important and *is* a focus in every national election, pretty obviously our main focus when voting for our politicians is going to be the domestic issues that affect us. 

By the same token, I expect every other country to elect politicians that are right *for them*, and whoever gets elected gets the responsibility/burden of dealing with foreign policy."
Excuse me what? You think Americans should consider the problems of people in other countries when deciding who to vote for as their own national leaders? Do you not understand what countries are? We have our own problems to try to solve.
"> As a European, I'm consistently appalled with how much the us elections are about local politics and ignore the rest of the world.

With Respect, the rest of the world is a literal ocean away which makes it hard for the average voter to care for more than a second. US politics, foreign policy-wise, are much more concerned with immediate neighbors like Mexico and the southern border much like Europe is with their neighbors. This leads to the focus on domestic issues with platitudes about foreign policy like with China or ""being respected on the world stage again"". Biden tried running on a campaign that put foreign policy in a more central position and frankly, nobody cared though his age did not help him."

"MAGA peeps' beliefs are downloaded every morning during their favorite fox segment. They dont have enough storage to update, so they delete everything that happened before."
"Yea. No. We are at a crossroads and our whole system of governance is in jeopardy by corrupted US officials and our foreign adversary in Russia. Republicans have shown to be willing to stall/block Ukraine aid at the behest of the Kremlin. We have very few options and they all require the DOJ and executive branch taking the gloves all the way off and taking extreme measures in most cases.

1) The worst option would be to treat this for what it is, an act of war by Russia. We can begin a military campaign on Russian forces all around the world and ultimately Russia itself which will more than likely invoke NATO article 5 and most likely lead to all out nuclear war. Not a good outcome for anyone alive.

2) The other option would be the insurrection act can be ordered by Biden to remove all the politicians and judges from power under suspicion of being compromised by Russia. This would include private citizens and all the other compromised major media entities like Musk, fox news, and Trump for ex. We would have to be under martial law because the Republicans are so compromised that half our governing body would be removed indefinitely. The Social and economic chaos would have a ripple effect all throughout the world. Politically motivated Violence will be present all throughout the country. Not a good option but the most effective long term. 

3) Do nothing and hope the election is won by a pro American party. Hope that the courts hold our enemies accountable while still having a platform to sow more political division and violence throughout our country If it's won by Democrats and Republicans try a legal coup and are successful, the US will cease to exist as we know it and the Constitution that has been governing us for over 250 years will be irrelevant and project 25 will be implemented while we slide into fascism. It goes the same if Trump wins the election. This is the path we're heading towards which is the less extreme one short term but definitely will have long term repercussions. Best case scenario, Dems win the election however, without removing the compromised parties involved it will just embolden our enemies foreign and domestic to attempt a more thorough and decisive actions in the future similar to what Hitler did with the Nazi party in taking control over the German government in the 1930s. 

Imo we would need a balance in between our two last options while not plunging the country into a second civil war which is what one side is clamoring for unfortunately. We should however not appease this traitorous behavior by any private citizen and even less tolerance for those that are government officials. History has shown us appeasement is not the answer and just breeds contempt which opens the door for eventual foreign interference. 

Just my thoughts"
This is the way
"Dems can still go after russians hard. For instance, allowing US weapons to be used more offensively on russian soil, going after russian propagandists in the US, etc. What is fox news going to say then, that harris is still putin's best friend? Then they'll also have to never report on dems ripping putin's influence to shreds, which is fine with me, cause what matters is that it happens."

"Look this up: the youngest generations are as easily fooled as the boomers, maybe even more:

>Compared to older generations, younger generations have reported higher rates of victimization in phishing, identity theft, romance scams, and cyberbullying. The Deloitte survey shows that Gen Z Americans were three times more likely to get caught up in an online scam than boomers were (16 percent and 5 percent, respectively). Compared to boomers, Gen Z was also twice as likely to have a social media account hacked (17 percent and 8 percent). Fourteen percent of Gen Z-ers surveyed said they’d had their location information misused, more than any other generation. The cost of falling for those scams may also be surging for younger people: Social Catfish’s 2023 report on online scams found that online scam victims under 20 years old lost an estimated $8.2 million in 2017. In 2022, they lost $210 million.

"Exactly, do people think China and Russia are allies because they actually like each other? They have a long history of antagonism, territory disputes, cultural clashes, and ideological differences that have nearly, or actually led them to war in the past century.

They're allies because they have national agendas that match up enough for them to be useful to each other. The second one of them decides the calculus has changed enough though, they won't hesitate to backstab each other in the name of finding their next ""ally"".

If the US just plopped down 50k soldiers into Ukraine and restored the previous border without launching anything into Russia I would guarantee there wouldn't be nuclear war.

The first real sign of intelligence is realizing you don't know every thing and need to learn.
"Ironically, not many people understand that."
Causally linked though. Being stupid causes a lot of ignorance.
I'm sure the Venn diagram of that is fascinating.
"True, but being willfully ignorant of things like world/current events is kinda stupid"
I mean it depends on the state of the world when it happens. You'd be insane to not heavily weight the Candidates views on World Affairs in the 1940 Election no matter what you believed.
"Even if the President puts domestic issues as top priority, they can't do much if Congress is useless."
"Foreign policy is where the President has the most power. Presidents can't really do all that much about domestic policy when compared ro Congress.

Really, a presidential candidate's foreign policy should probably weight highest of all in your consideration, as it is guaranteed to matter."
I don't think they do a lot of impactful voting in China.
"Trump called Gen. Mark Milley and John Kelly ""very stupid"" on a podcast hosted by a former navy seal. Have you seen the credentials on those 2? Trump cannot hold a candle to those 2."
"Kevin got super lucky that Dwight basically just fired him instead of having DM launch an investigation. His embezzlement was very obvious, and they definitely knew. At least, Oscar probably did. Dwight may have just attributed his keleven accounting as him being kinda dumb and bad at math, rather than him stealing from the company. So he just fired him for being bad at his job instead. Since they all liked Kevin as their simple teddy bear of a coworker, nobody said shit.

It's actually kinda funny that Andy went to Oscar to ask him to fudge the numbers that one time, and Kevin volunteered to do it but they just looked at him with pity, as they did not think him capable of doing it despite the fact that he has been doing it for years lol."
and yard signs....
"I just want to see if I can get them to put ""I'm voting for Jeffrey Epstein's pedophile bestie"" on their hats and lawn before the old bastard croaks"
"That would kill the merchandisse industry around trump though. They need changing slogans to sell mechandising. It's actually genious.

Now with the idiot shirt, they would kever have to change that one as it remains true regardless of what happens around them."
He’s gonna name his next kid a symbol or some shit like Prince did for a bit
"I just found elon's baby name book online! He's just a loving parent who wants a unique name for his kids. /s

It can be both.
Not a single mention of sharks or electric boats.
yeah this is big 2017 Trump energy
Farage also attended Candace Owens wedding
"A lot of people who voted for it though were old people, young people by and large voted to remain, I've never voted for a political party but, my old girl told me to vote remain 'I know you don't care for politics, but it's important that we stay in the single market'

It is unfortunate that the people who actually voted for brexit are the ones who have the least amount of time they get to live through it. In other words, young people will have to live decades of it, while the older people will die and won't have to."
"Orwell couldn't imagine that a population that has more opportunities and more wealth in all of human history would willingly and without threat of violence embrace their own subjugation. He thought that people needed to be beaten down, hopeless, and forcibly brainwashed.

Instead you have stadiums of volunteers begging to lick boots."
Hey now don't insult 6 year olds like that.
"I thought the fossil fuel industry has already pivoted to green energy? They still want to keep their oil profits and fight against green legislation, but I remember seeing a graph that a lot of green tech and green companies are owned substantially by oil companies. They've already diversified, they won't just die quietly, they'll make sure their part of the new green future as well by literally buying into it."
"Not even US troops. Each of France, Britain, and Poland have said they would be willing to go into Ukraine solo without NATO troops. Russia would be quickly bombed in Ukraine and forced to retreat with whatever hasn't been turned into fertilizer in the Ukrainian landscape"
"Mine is Slaughterhouse Five, but I'm a fucked up veteran.  So it goes.

I could not get through Sirens of Titan.  Not sure if that helps people avoid it, or just reveals something about me."
Here to support cats cradle. I still think about the concept of ice nine like once every two months or so
Are they stupid or ignorant 
And to be ignorant on a wide-ranging amount of things likely takes some stupidity.
"FDR ran as the isolationist candidate in 1940. Yes, he was incumbent, but he certainly didn't intend to stay on the sideline of WWII."
Did the navy seal have the decency to correct him or is he the brainwashed or the hateful type?
His daughter will be known as Dotty spelled “…”
"""I am excited to announce the birth of my latest son, /sbin/shutdown -r now."""
"It was basically coherent, which is an immediate failure. The cadence was good though."
Yup. Turns out it was Huxley who was right after all.
"> Instead you have stadiums of volunteers begging to lick boots.

And they didn't even have to see what was inside Room 101"
"I will give George Lucas *one* redeeming line from the prequel trilogy because it was true and also horrifying:

*So this is how democracy ends. With thunderous applause.*"
"It gets more insidious. Right-wingers across the world have at least one thing in common, crucial characteristic.

They are *children.*

Completely stunted in their maturing phase, utterly incapable of feeling responsibility, averse to introspection, where they threw tantrums by throwing their toy before, they now throw bombs.

Children are cruel, indeed."
That's true. Most six year olds at least have a more developed sense of right & wrong.
Not a vet but I love Slaughterhouse Five. It's as funny as it is sad.
"Which was the smart move to stay in power. Joseph Kennedy was famously Isolationist, the Ambassador to the UK. JFK splitting with him was monumental among those types, like seriously rattled their whole existence it showed true independence. 

FDR couldn't stand Joseph Kennedy and was constantly trying to destroy him. I think people overestimate FDR's power, it plummeted after the first 100 Days."
"Ah, yes, little Bobby tables we call him."
Shut up and give me my soma.
"Frighteningly, it seems like they were both right in some ways."
"I was a problem student of the sort where sometimes teachers figured out exactly how to wrangle me while most could not.  One of the few who did was an English teacher.  We'd been assigned *1984* and I'd found it interesting enough to read the entire book by the day or two after it'd been assigned.  Being a problem student and thus having read it, most of the stuff that involved reading it in class was rather pointless.  I wouldn't set out to be disruptive, but intent aside, I *would* be disruptive.  So the English teacher pulled me aside after class one day with a rather compelling deal.  I clearly knew how to write properly, how to interpret text, and all the usual things, and yet this apparent mastery was not reflected in my grades.  The deal was that I needed to read *Fahrenheit 451* and *Brave New World* and then give a short presentation to the class comparing and contrasting the nature of the dystopian worlds.   If I did this, she'd overlook just how little homework I'd turned in.  

*Fahrenheit 451* was, like *1984*, pretty open about its dystopian nature.  The systems of control and oppression were obvious in both.  *Brave New World*, though, stumped me.  For the first half of the book the world didn't seem bad at all.  In fact, it seemed to be rather open, even *idyllic* in some ways.  I was on the last third before it struck me:  all these happy dumb people were being oppressed, not because their choices had been crushed by an oppressive regime the the usual jackboots and truncheon, but because their basic ability to make choices had been all but entirely eliminated.

*Farenheit 451*, meanwhile, gave me a world just about as obviously bad as *1984*, but the twist was that this was really what the people wanted.  Day after day they woke up and agreed that the status quo was actually for the best.

*1984* might be horrifying because of its inhuman cruelty and all, but *Brave New World* scared me because it showed how you could build a world just as broken with a population just as oppressed and have it look kinda like a *good idea* if you didn't stop to think about it.  *Farenheit 451* scared me because, well, they'd chosen to *not* stop and think about it.  It was difficult to imagine how the world of *1984* could come to pass, but the other two?  Those seemed downright *plausible*.

(This was also the gist of my presentation.  I must have done okay, because I did, in fact, pass the class.)"
Spoiler: Room 101 is a unisex public toilet.
"Okay, but this tracks so hard. My dad is a complete Maga cultist now. His parents were shit at raising him, absent father and a selfish mother. She literally was told by a doctor that all her daughters health problems were because she smoked and drank while pregnant with her and she still decided to smoke and drink when she was pregnant with my dad. He is almost a whole foot shorter than all of his cousins because of it. He and my mom ended up turning me into a pseudo parent when I was a kid. I still feel like I have to practically babysit them when we go out together. Like they were never taught how to be people and they've just been doing what they can, but it's like if you put a child behind the wheel of a car with no further instructions. Maybe we need to try more gentle approaches? Like you would with a child? You've given me a lot to think about...."
"Seriously, if I told a 6 year old 'fire is hot' then 'fire is not hot' they'd absolutely be more critical and incredulous than the avg republican when it comes to russia. That's... not good."
Soma is short for social media.
Weed gummies are legal in many states now.
Yeah. They both tapped into some fairly poignant observations about human nature.
You don't have to bring Ted Cruz into this.

"I mean, Putin is trying a level of reverse-psychology that some 3 year olds I've met would roll their eyes at, so it does track."
